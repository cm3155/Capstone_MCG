to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders if not managed well risks can result in financial loss regulatory sanctions and penalties and damage to our reputation each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies we take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined risk framework and an articulated risk appetite statement which are approved annually by the enterprise risk committee erc and the board the seven key types of risk faced by the corporation are strategic credit market liquidity compliance operational and reputational table start strategic risk is the risk resulting from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors inappropriate business plans ineffective business strategy execution or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory macroeconomic or competitive environments in the geographic locations in which we operate table endtable start credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations table endtable start market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities or otherwise negatively impact earnings table endtable start liquidity risk is the inability to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions table endtable start compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the corporation arising from the failure of the corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws rules and regulations and our internal policies and procedures table endtable start operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes people and systems or from external events table endtable start reputational risk is the risk that negative perceptions of the corporations conduct or business practices may adversely impact its profitability or operations table end the following sections address in more detail the specific procedures measures and analyses of the major categories of risk this discussion of managing risk focuses on the current risk framework that as part of its annual review process was approved by the erc and the board as set forth in our risk framework a culture of managing risk well is fundamental to fulfilling our purpose and our values and delivering responsible growth it requires us to focus on risk in all activities and encourages the necessary mindset and behavior to enable effective risk management and promotes sound risktaking within our risk appetite sustaining a culture of managing risk well throughout the organization is critical to our success and is a clear expectation of our executive management team and the board our risk framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the corporation the risk framework sets forth clear roles responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the board through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities executive management assesses with board oversight the riskadjusted returns of each business management reviews and approves the strategic and financial operating plans as well as the capital plan and risk appetite statement and recommends them annually to the board for approval our strategic plan takes into consideration return objectives and financial resources which must align with risk capacity and risk appetite management sets financial objectives for each business by allocating capital and setting a target for return on capital for each business capital allocations and operating limits are regularly evaluated as part of our overall governance processes as the businesses and the economic environment in which we operate continue to evolve for more information regarding capital allocations see business segment operations on page the corporations risk appetite indicates the amount of capital earnings or liquidity we are willing to put at risk to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans consistent with applicable regulatory requirements our risk appetite provides a common and comparable set of measures for senior management and the board to clearly indicate our aggregate level of risk and to monitor whether the corporations risk profile remains in alignment with our strategic and capital plans our risk appetite is formally articulated in the risk appetite statement which includes both qualitative components and quantitative limits our overall capacity to take risk is limited therefore we prioritize the risks we take in order to maintain a strong and flexible financial position so we can withstand challenging economic conditions and take advantage of organic growth opportunities therefore we set objectives and targets for capital and liquidity that are intended to permit us to continue to operate in a safe and sound manner including during periods of stress our lines of business operate with risk limits which may include credit market andor operational limits as applicable that align with the corporations risk appetite executive management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to guidelines or limits the board and its committees when appropriate oversee financial performance execution of the strategic and financial operating plans adherence to risk appetite limits and the adequacy of internal controls for a more detailed discussion of our risk management activities see the discussion below and pages through risk management governance the risk framework describes delegations of authority whereby the board and its committees may delegate authority to managementlevel committees or executive officers such delegations may authorize certain decisionmaking and approval functions which may be evidenced in for example committee charters job descriptions meeting minutes and resolutions table start bank of america table end the chart below illustrates the interrelationship among the board board committees and management committees that have the majority of risk oversight responsibilities for the corporation reports to the ceo and cfo with oversight by the audit committee board of directors and board

processes and in daytoday business processes across the corporation with a goal of ensuring risks are appropriately considered evaluated and responded to in a timely manner we employ our risk management process referred to as identify measure monitor and control as part of our daily activities identify to be effectively managed risks must be clearly defined and proactively identified proper risk identification focuses on recognizing and understanding key risks inherent in our business activities or key risks that may arise from external factors each employee is expected to identify and escalate risks promptly risk identification is an ongoing process incorporating input from flus and control functions designed to be forward looking and capture relevant risk factors across all of our lines of business measure once a risk is identified it must be prioritized and accurately measured through a systematic risk quantification process including quantitative and qualitative components risk is measured at various levels including but not limited to risk type flu legal entity and on an aggregate basis this risk quantification process helps to capture changes in our risk profile due to changes in strategic direction concentrations portfolio quality and the overall economic environment senior management considers how risk exposures might evolve under a variety of stress scenarios monitor we monitor risk levels regularly to track adherence to risk appetite policies standards procedures and processes we also regularly update risk assessments and review risk exposures through our monitoring we can determine our level of risk relative to limits and can take action in a timely manner we also can determine when risk limits are breached and have processes to appropriately report and escalate exceptions this includes requests for approval to managers and alerts to executive management managementlevel committees or the board directly or through an appropriate committee control we establish and communicate risk limits and controls through policies standards procedures and processes that define the responsibilities and authority for risktaking the limits and controls can be adjusted by the board or management when conditions or risk tolerances warrant these limits may be absolute eg loan amount trading volume or relative eg percentage of

sensitivities to certain economic and business scenarios including economic and market conditions that are more severe than anticipated these stress forecasts provide an understanding of the potential impacts from our risk profile on the balance sheet earnings and capital and serve as a key component of our capital and risk management practices the intent of stress testing is to develop a comprehensive understanding of potential impacts of on and offbalance sheet risks at the corporation and how they impact financial resiliency which provides confidence to management regulators and our investors contingency planning we have developed and maintain contingency plans that are designed to prepare us in advance to respond in the event of potential adverse economic financial or market

our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions to achieve that objective we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources including our stable deposit base and seek to align liquidityrelated incentives and risks we define liquidity as readily available assets limited to cash and highquality liquid unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as those obligations arise we manage our liquidity position through line of business and alm activities as well as through our legal entity funding strategy on both a forward and current including intraday basis under both expected and stressed conditions we believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements maximizes access to funding sources minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events the board approves our liquidity risk policy and the financial contingency and recovery plan the erc establishes our liquidity risk tolerance levels the mrc is responsible for overseeing liquidity risks and directing management to maintain exposures within the established tolerance levels the mrc reviews and monitors our liquidity position and stress testing results approves certain liquidity risk limits and reviews the impact of strategic decisions on our liquidity for more information see managing risk on page under this governance framework we have developed certain funding and liquidity risk management practices which include maintaining liquidity at the parent company and selected subsidiaries including our bank subsidiaries and other regulated entities determining what amounts of liquidity are appropriate for these entities based on analysis of debt maturities and other potential cash outflows including those that we may experience during stressed market conditions diversifying funding sources considering our asset profile and legal entity structure and performing contingency planning nb holdings corporation we have intercompany arrangements with certain key subsidiaries under which we transferred certain assets of bank of america corporation as the parent company which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and nonbank subsidiaries and agreed to transfer certain additional parent company assets not needed to satisfy anticipated nearterm expenditures to nb holdings corporation a whollyowned holding company subsidiary nb holdings the parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets in consideration for the transfer of assets nb holdings issued a subordinated note to the parent company in a principal amount equal to the value of the transferred assets the aggregate principal amount of the note will increase by the amount of any future asset transfers nb holdings also provided the parent company with a committed line of credit that allows the parent company to draw funds necessary to service nearterm cash needs these arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy under which only the parent company would be resolved under the us bankruptcy code these arrangements include provisions to terminate the line of credit forgive the subordinated note and require the parent company to transfer its remaining financial assets to nb holdings if our projected liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the parent company becomes imminent global liquidity sources and other unencumbered assets we maintain liquidity available to the corporation including the parent company and selected subsidiaries in the form of cash and highquality liquid unencumbered securities our liquidity buffer referred to as global liquidity sources gls is comprised of assets that are readily available to the parent company and selected subsidiaries including holding company bank and

liquidity stress analysis we utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios the scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate marketwide and corporationspecific events including potential credit rating downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries and more severe events including potential resolution scenarios the scenarios are based on our historical experience experience of distressed and failed financial institutions regulatory guidance and both expected and unexpected future events the types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include but are not limited to upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuance diminished access to secured financing markets potential deposit withdrawals increased draws on loan commitments liquidity facilities and letters of credit additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities changes in certain market factors including but not limited to credit rating downgrades could negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the related financial instruments and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results we consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity we also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses net stable funding ratio us banking regulators issued a proposal for a net stable funding ratio nsfr requirement applicable to us financial institutions following the basel committees final standard the proposed us nsfr would apply to the corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions while the final requirement remains pending and is subject to change if finalized as proposed we expect to be in compliance within the regulatory timeline the standard is intended to reduce funding risk over a longer time horizon the nsfr is designed to provide an appropriate amount of stable funding generally capital and liabilities maturing beyond one year given the mix of assets and offbalance sheet items diversified funding sources we fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products programs markets currencies and investor groups the primary benefits of our centralized funding approach include greater control reduced funding costs wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries where regulations time zone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt we fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits which were trillion and trillion at december and deposits are primarily generated by our consumer banking gwim and global banking segments these deposits are diversified by clients product type and geography and the majority of our us deposits are insured by the fdic we consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable lowcost and consistent source of funding we believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings including credit card securitizations and securitizations with governmentsponsored enterprises gse the fha and privatelabel investors as well as fhlb loans our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions we believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more costefficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing repurchase agreements are generally shortterm and table start bank of america table end often overnight disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing we manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations when appropriate for more information on secured financing agreements see note federal funds sold or purchased securities financing agreements shortterm borrowings and restricted cash to the consolidated financial statements we issue longterm unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve costefficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile while the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general

begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or counterparty based on an analysis of its financial position as part of the overall credit risk assessment our commercial credit exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards subsequent to loan origination risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis and if necessary adjusted to reflect changes in the financial condition cash flow risk profile or outlook of a borrower or counterparty in making credit decisions we consider risk rating collateral country industry and singlename concentration limits while also balancing these considerations with the total borrower or counterparty relationship we use a variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations we use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios in addition risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of allocated capital and the allowance for credit losses as part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives we attempt to work with clients experiencing financial difficulty to modify their loans to terms that better align with their current ability to pay in situations where an economic concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty we identify

in part to energy reserve releases in the prioryear periods assuming a stable economic environment in compared to the end of we expect net chargeoffs of approximately billion per quarter in in view of the newly adopted accounting standard on the measurement of the allowance for credit losses we expect the provision for credit losses to be modestly higher than net chargeoffs in assuming no change in the current economic outlook and estimates of loan growth including product mix for more information regarding the new accounting standard see note summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements allowance for credit losses allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two components the first component covers nonperforming commercial loans and tdrs the second component covers loans and leases on which there are incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable as well as incurred losses that may not be represented in the loss forecast models we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the total of these two components each of which is described in more detail below the allowance for loan and lease losses excludes loans heldforsale lhfs and loans accounted for under the fair value option as the fair value reflects a credit risk component the first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers both nonperforming commercial loans and all tdrs within the consumer and commercial portfolios these loans are subject to impairment measurement based on the present value of projected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or in certain circumstances impairment may also be based upon the collateral value or the loans observable market price if available impairment measurement for the renegotiated consumer credit card and small business credit card tdr portfolios is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average portfolio contractual interest rate excluding promotionally priced loans in effect prior to restructuring for purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical experience for the respective product types and risk ratings of the loans the second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers the remaining consumer and commercial loans and leases that have incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable the allowance for consumer including credit card and other consumer loans and certain homogeneous commercial loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations which include both quantitative and qualitative components generally by product type loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including but not limited to historical loss experience estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends delinquencies economic trends credit scores and the amount of loss in the event of default our consumer real estate loss forecast model estimates the portion of loans that will default based on individual loan attributes the most significant of which are refreshed ltv or combined loantovalue cltv and borrower credit score as well as vintage and geography all of which are further broken down into current delinquency status additionally we incorporate the delinquency status of underlying firstlien loans on our juniorlien home equity portfolio in our allowance process incorporating refreshed ltv and cltv into our probability of default allows us to factor the impact of changes in home prices into our allowance for loan and lease losses these loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflecting the current economic environment as of december the loss forecast process resulted in reductions in the allowance related to the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios compared to december the allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience internal risk rating current economic conditions industry performance trends geographic and obligor concentrations within each portfolio and any other pertinent information the statistical models for commercial loans are generally updated annually and utilize our historical database of actual defaults and other data including external default data the loan risk ratings and composition of the commercial portfolios used to calculate the allowance are updated quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflecting the current economic environment for riskrated commercial loans we estimate the probability of default and the loss given default lgd based on our historical experience of defaults and credit losses factors considered when assessing the internal risk rating include the value of the underlying collateral if applicable the industry in which the obligor operates the obligors liquidity and other financial indicators and other quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the obligors credit risk as of december the allowance for the commercial real estate portfolio increased compared to december also included within the second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses are reserves to cover losses that are incurred but in our assessment may not be adequately represented in the historical loss data used in the loss forecast models for example factors that we consider include among others changes in lending policies and procedures changes in economic and business conditions changes in the nature and size of the portfolio changes in portfolio concentrations changes in the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements further we consider the inherent uncertainty in mathematical models that are built upon historical data we monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease losses this monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios the allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio as presented in table was billion at december a decrease of million from december the decrease was primarily in the consumer real estate portfolio partially offset by an increase in the credit card portfolio the table start bank of america table end reduction in the allowance for the consumer real estate portfolio was driven by improved credit quality a decrease in loan balances in our noncore portfolio proactive credit risk management initiatives and high credit quality originations the improved credit quality was impacted

loan and lease losses we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit financial guarantees unfunded bankers acceptances and binding loan commitments excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option unfunded lending commitments are subject to the same assessment as funded loans including estimates of probability of default and lgd due to the nature of unfunded commitments the estimate of probable losses must also consider utilization to estimate the portion of these undrawn commitments that is likely to be drawn by a borrower at the time of estimated default analyses of our historical experience are applied to the unfunded commitments to estimate the funded exposure at default ead the expected loss for unfunded lending

market risk management market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities or otherwise negatively impact earnings this risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations primarily within our global markets segment we are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the corporation eg our alm activities in the event of market stress these risks could have a material impact on our results for more information see interest rate risk management for the banking book on page our traditional banking loan and deposit products are nontrading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities historical cost however these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions with one of the primary risks being changes in the levels of interest rates the risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our nontrading positions arising from changes in interest rates is managed through our alm activities we have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes reflected in income trading positions are subject to various changes in marketbased risk factors the majority of this risk is generated by our activities in the interest rate foreign exchange credit equity and commodities markets in addition the values of assets and liabilities could change due to market liquidity correlations across markets and expectations of market volatility we seek to manage these risk exposures by using a variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial instruments the key risk management techniques are discussed in more detail in the trading risk management section global risk management is responsible for providing senior management with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to which we are exposed these responsibilities include ownership of market risk policy developing and maintaining quantitative risk models calculating aggregated risk measures establishing and monitoring position limits consistent with risk appetite conducting daily reviews and analysis of trading inventory approving material risk exposures and fulfilling regulatory requirements market risks that impact businesses outside of global markets are monitored and governed by their respective governance functions model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports given that models are used across the corporation model risk impacts all risk types including credit market and operational risk the enterprise model risk committee emrc a subcommittee of the mrc is responsible for providing management oversight and approval of model risk management and governance the emrc defines model risk standards consistent with the corporations risk framework and risk appetite prevailing regulatory guidance and industry best practice all models including risk management valuation and regulatory capital models must meet certain validation criteria including effective challenge of the conceptual soundness of the model independent model testing and ongoing monitoring through outcomes analysis and benchmarking the emrc oversees that model standards are consistent with model risk requirements and monitors the effective challenge in the model validation process across the corporation interest rate risk interest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates these instruments include but are not limited to loans debt securities certain tradingrelated assets and liabilities deposits borrowings and derivatives hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include derivatives such as options futures forwards and swaps foreign exchange risk foreign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the us dollar the types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in nonus subsidiaries foreign currencydenominated loans and securities future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions foreign currencydenominated debt and various foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or nonus interest rates hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options currency swaps futures forwards and foreign currencydenominated debt and deposits mortgage risk mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the values of mortgagerelated instruments the values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates mortgage rates agency debt ratings default market liquidity government participation and interest rate volatility our exposure to these instruments takes several forms for example we trade and engage in marketmaking activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans passthrough certificates commercial mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations including collateralized debt obligations using mortgages as underlying collateral in addition we originate a variety of mbs which involves the accumulation of mortgagerelated loans in anticipation of eventual securitization and we may hold positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the alm portfolio we also record msrs as part of our mortgage origination activities hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include derivatives such as options swaps futures and forwards as well as securities including mbs and us treasury securities for more information see mortgage banking risk management on page equity market risk equity market risk represents exposures to securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic and foreign common stock or other equitylinked instruments instruments that would lead to this exposure include but are not limited to the following common stock exchangetraded funds american depositary receipts convertible bonds listed equity options puts and calls otc equity options equity total return swaps equity index futures and other equity derivative products hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options futures swaps convertible bonds and cash positions commodity risk commodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the petroleum natural gas power and metals markets these instruments consist primarily of futures forwards swaps and options hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product as well as cash positions issuer credit risk issuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of credit spreads by credit migration or by defaults hedging instruments table start bank of america table end used to mitigate this risk include bonds cds and other credit fixedincome instruments market liquidity risk market liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of expected market activity changes dramatically and in certain cases may even cease this exposes us to the risk that we will not be able to transact business and execute trades in an orderly manner which may impact our results this impact could be further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are compromised by disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments we utilize various risk mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in trading risk management trading risk management to evaluate risks in our trading activities we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions various techniques and procedures are utilized to enable the most complete understanding of these risks quantitative measures of market risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the corporation these measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in interest rates and statistical measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical market moves such as var and stress testing periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees qualitative evaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk measures while understanding each of their respective limitations additionally risk managers independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment and potential future environments var is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk factors including the effects of portfolio diversification a var model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses var represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period based on a specified holding period confidence level and window of historical data we use one var model consistently across the trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a threeyear window of historical data our primary var statistic is equivalent to a percent confidence level which means that for a var with a oneday holding period there should not be losses in excess of var on average out of trading days within any var model there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company the accuracy of a var model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio a var model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have the necessary historical market data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available for positions with insufficient historical data for the var calculation the process for establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and statistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position this analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data would be expected to experience var may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as changes in market conditions or in the composition of the portfolio can have a material impact on the results in particular the historical data used for the var calculation might indicate higher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be experienced in order for the var model to reflect current market conditions we update the historical data underlying our var model on a weekly basis or more frequently during periods of market stress and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model a minor portion of risks related to our trading positions is not included in var these risks are reviewed as part of our icaap for more information regarding icaap see capital management on page global risk management continually reviews evaluates and enhances our var model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio changes to the var model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate management committees trading limits on quantitative risk measures including var are independently set by global markets risk management and reviewed on a regular basis so that trading limits remain relevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks trading limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity volatility and strategic business priorities trading limits are set at both a granular level to allow for extensive coverage of risks as well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations among risk factors all trading limits are approved at least annually approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a centralized limits management system trading limit excesses are communicated to management for review certain quantitative market risk measures and corresponding limits have been identified as critical in the corporations risk appetite statement these risk appetite limits are reported on a daily basis and are approved at least annually by the erc and the board in periods of market stress global markets senior leadership communicates daily to discuss losses key risk positions and any limit excesses as a result of this process the businesses may selectively reduce risk table presents the total marketbased portfolio var which is the combination of the total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio and the fair value option portfolio covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets and liabilities both on and offbalance sheet that meet a defined set of specifications these specifications identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a shortterm horizon and where we are able to hedge the material risk elements in a twoway market positions in less liquid markets or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions typically do not qualify as covered positions foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval in addition table presents our fair value option portfolio which includes substantially all of the funded and unfunded exposures for which we elect the fair value option and their corresponding hedges additionally market risk var for trading activities as presented in table differs from var used for regulatory capital calculations due to the holding period being used the holding period for var used for regulatory capital calculations is days while for the market risk var presented below it is one day both measures utilize the same process and methodology the total

accuracy of the var methodology is evaluated by backtesting which compares the daily var results utilizing a oneday holding period against a comparable subset of trading revenue a backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the var for the corresponding day these excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss with a goal to ensure that the var methodology accurately represents those losses we expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of var to be in line with the confidence level of the var statistic being tested for example with a percent confidence level we expect one trading loss in excess of var every days or between two to three trading losses in excess of var over the course of a year the number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the var calculation the trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the var component of the regulatory capital calculation this revenue differs from total tradingrelated revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in var some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees commissions reserves net interest income and intraday trading revenues we conduct daily backtesting on the var results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the var results for key legal entities regions and risk factors these results are reported to senior market risk management senior management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests during there were no days in which there was a backtesting excess for our total covered portfolio var utilizing a oneday holding period total tradingrelated revenue total tradingrelated revenue excluding brokerage fees and cva dva and funding valuation adjustment gains losses represents the total amount earned from trading positions including marketbased net interest income which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets trading account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value for more information on fair value see note fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements tradingrelated revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand also tradingrelated revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions the level of risk assumed and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the everchanging market environment significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed the following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of tradingrelated revenue for and during positive tradingrelated revenue was recorded for percent of the trading days of which percent were daily trading gains of over million and the largest loss was million this compares to where positive tradingrelated revenue was recorded for percent of the trading days of which percent were daily trading gains of over million trading portfolio stress testing because the very nature of a var model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis this analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements a set of scenarios categorized as either historical or hypothetical are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses these scenarios include shocks to underlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate var historical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves that occurred during a period of extended historical market stress generally a multiweek period representing the most severe point during a crisis is selected for each historical scenario hypothetical scenarios provide estimated portfolio impacts from potential future market stress events scenarios are reviewed and updated in response to changing positions and new economic or political information in addition new or ad hoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential market events or particular vulnerabilities in the portfolio the stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management stress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with enterprisewide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework the macroeconomic scenarios used for enterprisewide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning for more information see managing risk on page interest rate risk management for the banking book the following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet interest rate risk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates clientfacing activities primarily lending and deposittaking create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet we prepare forwardlooking forecasts of net interest income the baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth alm positioning and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the marketbased forward curve we then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions the net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends market conditions and business strategies thus we continually monitor table start bank of america table end our balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes the interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing changes in funding mix product repricing maturity characteristics and investment securities premium amortization our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital table presents the spot and 12month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at december and table start table forward rates december federal funds threemonth libor 10year swap spot rates 12month forward rates december spot rates 12month forward rates table end table shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next months from december and resulting from instantaneous parallel and nonparallel shocks to the marketbased forward curve periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment during the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet increased primarily due to decreases in interest rates we continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve additionally higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and accordingly for debt securities classified as available for sale afs may adversely affect accumulated other comprehensive income oci and thus capital levels under the basel capital rules under instantaneous upward parallel shifts the nearterm adverse impact to basel capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income for more

instantaneous change table end the sensitivity analysis in table assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates as part of our alm activities we use securities certain residential mortgages and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity the behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income the sensitivity analysis in table assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments in higher rate scenarios any customer activity resulting in the replacement of lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or marketbased funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our alm activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk we use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components for more information on our hedging activities see note derivatives to the consolidated financial statements our interest rate contracts are generally nonleveraged generic interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps options futures and forwards in addition we use foreign exchange contracts including crosscurrency interest rate swaps foreign currency futures contracts foreign currency forward contracts and options to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities changes to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management the decisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate and foreign currency environments balance sheet composition and trends and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions we use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions collectively referred to as cash flow hedges the net losses on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated oci were million and billion on a pretax basis at december and these net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates

principles to the consolidated financial statements are essential in understanding the mda many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities we have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments the more judgmental estimates are summarized in the following discussion we have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that involve mathematical models to derive the estimates in many cases there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models where alternatives exist we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could materially impact our results of operations separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables the value of our lending portfolio and marketsensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date often significantly due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant negative effect on future operating results these fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs table start bank of america table end allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments represents managements estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the corporations loan and lease portfolio excluding those loans accounted for under the fair value option the allowance for credit losses includes both quantitative and qualitative components the qualitative component has a higher degree of management subjectivity and includes factors such as concentrations economic conditions and other considerations our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in note summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements our estimate for the allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the loss rates and expected cash flows from our consumer real estate and credit card and other consumer portfolio segments as well as our us small business commercial card portfolio within the commercial portfolio segment for each onepercent increase in the loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment in our consumer real estate portfolio segment coupled with a onepercent decrease in the discounted cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for impairment within this portfolio segment the allowance for loan and lease losses at december would have increased million within our credit card and other consumer portfolio segment and us small business commercial card portfolio for each onepercent increase in the loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment coupled with a onepercent decrease in the expected cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for impairment the allowance for loan and lease losses at december would have increased million our allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the risk ratings assigned to loans and leases within the commercial portfolio segment excluding the us small business commercial card portfolio assuming a downgrade of one level in the internal risk ratings for commercial loans and leases except loans and leases already classified as substandard and doubtful as defined by regulatory authorities the allowance for loan and lease losses would have increased billion at december the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases at december was percent and these hypothetical increases in the allowance would raise the ratio to percent these sensitivity analyses do not represent managements expectations of the deterioration in risk ratings or the increases in loss rates but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan and lease losses to changes in key inputs we believe the risk ratings and loss severities currently in use are appropriate and that the probability of the alternative scenarios outlined above occurring within a short period of time is remote the process of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses requires a high degree of judgment it is possible that others given the same information may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions the processes judgments and estimates described herein relate to the accounting standard in effect through december on january the corporation adopted the new accounting standard that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on managements best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the corporations relevant financial assets the corporations lifetime expected credit losses are determined using macroeconomic forecast assumptions and management judgments applicable to and through the expected life of the loan portfolios for more information see note summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements fair value of financial instruments under applicable accounting standards we are required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value we classify fair value measurements of financial instruments and msrs based on the threelevel fair value hierarchy in the accounting standards the fair values of assets and liabilities may include adjustments such as market liquidity and credit quality where appropriate valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs where market data is available the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity in periods of extreme volatility lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process in keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities we have in place various processes and controls that include a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products primarily through validation controls we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both marketobservable and internallymodeled values andor valuation inputs our reliance on this information is affected by our understanding of how the broker andor pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own internal modeling for example broker quotes in less active markets may only be indicative and therefore less reliable these processes and controls are performed independently of the business for more information see note fair value measurements and note fair value option to the consolidated financial statements level assets and liabilities financial assets and liabilities and msrs where values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as level under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting standards the fair value of these level financial assets and liabilities and msrs is determined using pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation level financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives classified as level or therefore gains or losses associated with level financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy the level gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital we conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis transfers into or out of level are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable respectively in the current marketplace for more information on transfers into and out of level during table start bank of america table end and see note fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements accrued income taxes and deferred tax assets accrued income taxes reported as a component of either other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet represent the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date we currently file income tax returns in more than jurisdictions and consider many factors including statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction net deferred tax assets reported as a component of other assets on the consolidated balance sheet represent the net decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net operating loss nol and tax credit carryforwards and because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements nol and tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities and many of these attributes can expire if not utilized within certain periods we consider the need for valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts that we estimate are more likely than not to be realized consistent with the applicable accounting guidance we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimates of accrued income taxes andor net deferred tax assets due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities these revisions of our estimates which also may result from our income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax audit matters may be material to our operating results for any given period see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for a table of significant tax attributes and

assets are discussed in note summary of significant accounting principles and note goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of june for all of our reporting units that had goodwill we performed that test by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its respective carrying value factors considered in the qualitative assessments include among other things macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other relevant entity and reportingunit specific considerations if based on the results of the qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative assessment is performed based on our qualitative assessments we determined that for each reporting unit with goodwill it was more likely than not that its respective fair value exceeded its carrying value indicating there was no impairment for more information regarding goodwill balances at june see note
