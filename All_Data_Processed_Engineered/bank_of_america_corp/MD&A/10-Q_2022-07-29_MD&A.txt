operating performance or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements these nongaap financial measures are not intended as a substitute for gaap financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as nongaap financial measures used by other companies we view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an fte basis which when presented on a consolidated basis are nongaap financial measures to derive the fte basis net interest income is adjusted to reflect taxexempt income on an equivalent beforetax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense for purposes of this calculation we use the federal statutory tax rate of percent and a representative state tax rate net interest yield which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds utilizes net interest income on an fte basis we believe that presentation of these items on an fte basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and taxexempt sources and is consistent with industry practices we may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items eg debit valuation adjustment dva gains losses which result in nongaap financial measures we believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of periodtoperiod operating performance we also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity a nongaap financial measure tangible equity represents shareholders equity or common shareholders equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets excluding mortgage servicing rights msrs net of related deferred tax liabilities adjusted shareholders equity or common shareholders equity these measures are used to evaluate our use of equity in addition profitability relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders equity and return on average tangible shareholders equity as key measures to support our overall growth objectives these ratios are return on average tangible common shareholders equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders equity the tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending

operational and reputational sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders if not managed well risk can result in financial loss regulatory sanctions and penalties and damage to our reputation each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies we take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined risk framework and an articulated risk appetite statement which are approved annually by the enterprise risk committee and the board bank of america our risk framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the corporation the risk framework sets forth roles and responsibilities for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the board through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities our risk appetite provides a common set of measures for senior management and the board to clearly indicate the level of risk we are willing to take in alignment with our strategic and capital plans and ensure that the corporations risk profile remains aligned with our risk appetite our risk appetite is formally articulated in the risk appetite statement which includes both qualitative components and quantitative limits that are reviewed and approved by the board at least annually for more information about the corporations risks including those related to the pandemic see item risk factors of the corporations annual report on form 10k these risks are

market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities or otherwise negatively impact earnings this risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations primarily within our global markets segment we are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the corporation eg our alm activities in the event of market stress these risks could have a material impact on our results trading risk management to evaluate risks in our trading activities we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions var is a common statistic used to measure market risk our primary var statistic is equivalent to a percent confidence level which means that for a var with a oneday holding period there should not be losses in excess of var on average out of trading days table presents the total marketbased portfolio var which is the combination of the

june and december resulting from instantaneous parallel and nonparallel shocks to the marketbased forward curve periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment the interest rate scenarios also assume us dollar interest rates are floored at zero depending on the level of interest rates downrate scenarios may not receive the full impact of the rate shock particularly in low rate environments during the six months ended june the overall decrease in asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to uprate and downrate scenarios was primarily due to an increase in longend and shortend rates we continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve additionally higher interest rates negatively impact the fair value of our debt securities classified as available for sale and adversely affect accumulated other comprehensive income and thus capital levels under the basel capital rules under instantaneous upward parallel shifts the nearterm adverse impact to basel capital would be reduced over time by offsetting positive

change longend instantaneous change nm steepeners shortend instantaneous change nm longend instantaneous change nm not meaningful the sensitivity analysis in table assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates as part of our alm activities we use securities certain residential mortgages and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity the behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income the sensitivity analysis in table assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments in higher rate scenarios any customer activity resulting in the replacement of lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or marketbased funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts we use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our alm activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks specifically we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks our interest rate derivative contracts are generally nonleveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps options futures and forwards and our foreign exchange contracts include crosscurrency interest rate swaps foreign currency futures contracts foreign currency forward contracts and options the derivatives used in our alm activities can be split into two broad categories designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the interest rate risk management for the banking book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in table the corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations by hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations the corporations market risk exposure in this area is insignificant risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the corporations nontrading foreign currencydenominated financial instruments these foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as crosscurrency basis spreads and interest rate risk however as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives the market risk related to this exposure is insignificant for more information on the accounting for derivatives see note derivatives to the consolidated financial statements mortgage banking risk management we originate fund and

climaterelated risks are divided into two major categories risks related to the transition to a lowcarbon economy which may entail extensive policy legal technology and market changes and risks related to the physical impacts of climate change driven by extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods as well as chronic longerterm shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels these changes and events can have broad impacts on operations supply chains distribution networks customers and markets and are otherwise referred to respectively as transition risk and physical risk these risks can impact both financial and nonfinancial risk types the impacts of transition risk can lead to and amplify credit risk or market risk by reducing our customers operating income or the value of their assets as well as expose us to reputational andor litigation risk due to increased regulatory scrutiny or negative public sentiment physical risk can lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers repayment capacity or impacting the value of collateral in addition it could pose increased operational risk to our facilities and people in we publicly announced our goal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in our financing activities operations and supply chain before net zero goal we also committed to set emission reduction targets for in connection with this commitment on april we published our first targets to reduce emissions by associated with our financing activities in the auto manufacturing energy and power generation sectors targets in line with our participation in the net zero banking alliance we currently expect to set financing activity emission reduction targets for other key sectors in these reduction targets are intended to align with the international energy agency net zero emissions global pathway to limit warming to degrees celsius we plan to disclose our financed emissions baseline for our auto manufacturing energy and power generation sectors along with data in our task force for climaterelated financial disclosures tcfd report that we expect to publish in the fall of we also plan to disclose the financed emissions for our business loan portfolio in achieving our net zero goal and targets will require technological advances clearly defined roadmaps for industry sectors public policies including those that improve the cost of capital for net zero transition and better emissions data reporting as well as ongoing strong and active engagement with clients suppliers investors government officials and
