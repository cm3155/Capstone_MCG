bank of america corp thanks lee and good morning to all of you and thank you for joining us im starting on slide of the earnings presentation this morning bank of america reported one of the best quarters and one of the best first halves of net income in the companys history our results this quarter once again include solid performance on things we can control by delivering organic growth and operating leverage we did that when economies remains healthy and had a slowing rate of growth it was also a quarter that included volatility from the debate about the debt ceiling continuation of central bank monetary tightening action and a slowing in consumer spending and a slowing inflation but as you look at it now our customer spending pattern is now more consistent with a prepandemic lower growth lower inflation economy before alastair takes you through the details let me summarize bank of americas quarter two performance on slide you can see the highlights we earned billion aftertax and grew earnings per share over the second quarter of all business segments performed well and i want to thank all my teammates for doing so we grew clients and accounts organically and at a strong pace we delivered our eighth straight quarter of operating leverage led by yearoveryear revenue growth we further strengthened our balance sheet improving our common equity tier ratio more than basis points yearoveryear to and we have billion in global liquidity sources we also produced strong returns for our shareholders with a return on tangible common equity of continuing a streak of many quarters at that level or above while our business has performed well this quarter i would particularly highlight our global markets and sales and trading team and our investment banking teams both have appeared to outperform their industry peers investments made over the past couple years in global markets capabilities under jimmy demares leadership as well as matthew koders leadership in the corporate global corporate investment banking area allow us to improve our market share for both of these fee pools id also note the strong contribution by our middlemarket clients and our teammates there led by wendy stewart id also like to touch a few additional points before turning the call over to alastair these points will help illustrate continued investment in the franchise and work we do to drive growth lets start with the organic growth slide on page on that page we highlight some of the important elements of organic growth and you see evidence in every business segment as you look at the page in consumer in quarter two we opened net new checking accounts consumer had now had straight quarters of positive net new checking account growth now these are core primary checking accounts across the board allowing our tremendous deposit franchise to continue to prosper and take market share while the progress may appear inchmeal over the last three years weve grown our core customers in consumer checking account customers from million to million we opened another million plus credit card accounts this quarter and have more investment accounts this year than we did last year in the consumer business consumer investment business balances in the reached a new high of billion aided by a increase in bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 new funded consumer investment accounts yearoveryear and frankly moving our money from our deposits into the market as they have done so in global wealth we added net new relationships in merrill and the private bank and our advisors opened more than new banking relationships in the quarter showing a strong differentiation in our model of fulfilling both investors and banking needs for clients in the past days we added experienced advisors to our sales force in addition to digital capabilities to help us deliver at scale in global banking we added clients and increased the number of solutions per relationship over the past three years weve added net new relationships managers and increased our clientfacing head count by nearly weve also improved our tools for prospect callings though investments in technology and its benefiting our ability to add customers and improve our solutions per existing client yeartodate weve added over new commercial and business banking clients across the united states which is the same number we added in the full year of last year again operationalizing that ability to do this at scale increases our speed of onboarding these clients in our global markets area we saw one of the highest second quarters for sales and trading in our history so another quarter of good organic growth to achieve that growth were managing our expense trajectory which alastair is going to cover it requires inherent efficiency progress from digital and other applied technology across all our units digital superiority is key to our operating dynamics first it produces a great customer experience resulting in strong customer retention and strong customer scores second it ensures our position as the lead transactional bank for our customers whether theyre consumers companies or investors third it preserves a strong deposit balance as a good price and do the core nature of transactional deposits and last but importantly it leads to efficiency so how were doing on digital progress you can see that on slide and first with the consumer in consumer we now have million active users that are digitally engaged with our digital platform and are logging over billion times a month and even with this scale the stage and maturity of logins is up double digits from last year customer uses of erica continues to beat expectations this was an early application of natural language processing and artificial intelligence that we built in our company and it continues to learn about it with additional use interactions with erica rose in just the past year and now has crossed over billion client interactions in the first five years of introduction theres a lot of questions about artificial intelligence out there but one cant kludge together a series of systems we have to build a system in this highly regulated high customerfocused business and erica is one such application and you can see its impact likewise zelle hasnt slowed down either the number of people using zelle grew this past year remember these arent new functionalities at this point theyve been around for years but they continue to grow very strong growth rate showing customer desire and acceptance in the activities you can see the digital sales continue to grow we continue to have both great high tech and high touch options as part of that weve added new financial centers since and by the end of this year we have refurbished every one of our existing centers in our company we plan on opening more centers a year for the next few years which includes an expansion of nine new markets we announced a few years ago a few weeks ago excuse me our entrance to these markets is enhanced by digital and leads to strong early success just to give you a point of reference for all the expansion markets over the last several years for branches opened a bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 year or more in those expansion markets our average deposit balances per those branch are million in each branch if you go to the wealth management digital on slide you can see that they continue to be the most digitally engaged clients in our company our advisors have led the way in driving a personaldriven advice model supplemented by our digital tools you can see the client adoption rate of in merrill and in the private bank have embraced digital delivery as a tool service providing even more convenience for them and our advisors erica and zelle also continue to expand in these client sets a new program we announced just a few quarters ago has generated digital leads to advisors its called advisor match matching our clients with advisors of their choice on slide you can see the digital engagement in the global banking area corporate treasurers corporate treasury teams and our clients appreciate the ease of doing business with us digitally cashpro app signins are up from last year where the value of payments through cashpro app are up as you can see every line of business is just delivering strong organic growth the investments made in technology have enabled us to grow industryleading positions in digital tools while enabling our clients to do great things and making us more efficient this provides for a very satisfied stable customer and client base with bank of america as a primary provider and by doing it with a digital application that also produces operating leverage on slide you can see our streak of operating leverage continued in the second quarter of were now back at eight quarters in a row the chart on slide covers eightandahalf years or quarters in all but eight of those quarters and you can see those identified six of which were in the heart of the pandemic weve achieved operating leverage operating leverage is that simple task of growing revenue at a better growth rate than expense as i said alastair is going to discuss with you our good and declining expansion trajectory which sets us up to continue to provide operating leverage even with a shifting economy in sum in the quarter we delivered earnings that are higher and a return on tangible common equity that was driven by continued strong organic growth and operating leverage in a volatile economic environment alastair is going to talk to you about a bit more strength we see ahead in our net interest income for the balance of the year and that provides a better start as we think about youre going to hear our expectations for the quarterly decline in expenses in the following quarters for the rest of even as we keep investing and you hear about the resilience of credit and strong trajectory of capital this all positions us well to continue both our streaks of organic growth and operating leverage with that let me turn it over to alastair alastair borthwick chief financial officer bank of america corp thank you brian and on slide we list the more detailed highlights of the quarter and then slide presents the summary income statement so im going to refer to both of those for the quarter we generated billion in net income and that resulted in per diluted share our yearoveryear revenue growth of was led by a improvement in net interest income coupled with a strong increase in sales and trading results exdva revenue was strong and it included a few headwinds and i thought id go through those headwinds first we had lower service charges from both higher earnings credit rates on deposits for commercial clients and the policy changes we announced in late to lower our insufficient funding overdraft fees for our consumer customers the good news on the consumer piece is yearoveryear comparisons get a business easier starting next quarter as the third quarter of reflects the full first quarter of these changes bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 second we had lower asset management and brokerage fees as a result of the lower equity and fixed income market levels and market uncertainty that impacted transactional volumes compared to a yearago quarter third we had a net dva loss of million in this quarter compared to a gain in dva of million in the second quarter a year ago we also recorded roughly million in securities losses as we closed out some available forsale security positions and their related hedges and we put the proceeds in cash lastly and just as a reminder our tax rate benefits from esg investments and those are somewhat offset by operating losses on the esg investments which show up in other income so this quarter our tax rate is a little bit lower and the operating losses are a little bit higher from volume of these deals so you have to be careful on analyzing the lower tax rate without considering the operating losses and that in turn often offsets what would have been higher revenue elsewhere our tax rate for the full year is expected to benefit by as a result of the esg investment tax credit deals and absent these credits our effective tax rate would still be roughly and we continue to expect a tax rate of to for the rest of expense for the quarter of billion included roughly million in litigation expense which was pushed higher this quarter by the agreements announced last week with the occ and the cfpb on consumer matters asset quality remains solid and provision expense for the quarter was billion consisting of million in net chargeoffs and million in reserve build the provision expense reflects the continued trend in chargeoffs toward prepandemic levels and its still below historical levels the chargeoff rate was basis points and thats only basis point higher than the first quarter and still remains well below the basis points that we last saw in  of when remember was a multidecade low id also use slide just to highlight returns and you can see we generated return on tangible common equity and basis points return on assets lets turn to the balance sheet starting on slide and you can see our balance sheet ended the quarter at trillion declining billion from the first quarter a billion or reduction in deposits closely matched a billion decline in securities balances through paydowns from the holdtomaturity and sales of availablefor sale securities securities are now down billion from quarter two cash levels remained high at billion and loans grew billion as brian noted our liquidity remained strong with billion of liquidity up modestly from the first quarter of and still remains nearly billion above our prepandemic fourth quarter level shareholders equity increased billion from the first quarter as earnings were only partially offset by capital distributed to shareholders aoci decreased by billion driven by derivatives valuation and afs securities values were little changed so theres little change in the aoci component that impacts regulatory capital tangible book value is up per share yearoveryear during the quarter we also paid out billion in common dividends and we bought back million in shares to offset our employee awards and last week we announced the intent to increase our dividend by beginning in the third quarter turning to regulatory capital our cet1 level improved to billion from march and the ratio of cet1 improved more than basis points to once again adding to the buffer over our current bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 requirement while our riskweighted assets increased modestly in the quarter also noteworthy on july we initiated dialogue with the fed to better understand our ccar exam results and the remaining discussions today with no news to update as of now in the past months weve improved our cet1 ratio by more than basis points and weve done that while supporting clients for loan demand and returned billion in dividends and share repurchases to shareholders our supplemental leverage ratio was versus our minimum requirement of and that leaves us plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth finally the tlac ratio remains comfortably above our requirements so lets now focus on loans by looking at average balances you can see those on slide and there you can see average loans grew yearoveryear the drivers of loan growth are much the same consumer credit card growth is strong and then commercial loans grew the credit card growth reflects increased marketing enhanced offers and higher levels of accounts openings over time and in commercial we saw a little bit of a slowdown this quarter driven by higher paydowns from borrowers and weaker customer demand as opposed to any credit availability from us we are still open for business for loans now while loan growth has slowed its generally remained still ahead of gdp and commercial client conversations remain solid as our clients seem to be waiting for some of the economic uncertainty to lift before borrowing further slide shows the breakout of deposit trends thats on a weekly ending basis across the last two quarters and its the same chart that we provided last quarter in the upper left you see the trend of total deposits we ended the second quarter at trillion down with several elements of our deposits seeming to find stability given the normal tax seasonality impacts on deposit balances in  and the monetary policy actions we believe this is a good result i want to use the other three charts on the page to illustrate the different trends across the last quarter and more specifically in each line of business in consumer looking at the top right chart you see the difference in the movement through the quarter between the balances of low to no interestchecking accounts and the higher yielding nonchecking accounts here you can also see the low levels of our more ratesensitive balances in consumer investments and cd balances and theyre both broken out here in total weve got still more than trillion in highquality consumer deposits which remains billion above prepandemic levels in the second quarter that decline in consumer deposits was driven by higher debt payments higher spend and seasonal tax activity and some nonchecking balances that rotated from deposits into brokerage accounts we did see some competitive pressure this quarter within about roughly billion of cds as some of the financial institutions pushed prices higher and at this point with deposits far exceeding our loans weve not yet felt the need to chase deposits with rate broadly speaking average deposit balances of our consumers remain at multiples of their prepandemic level especially in the lower end of our customer base total rate paid on consumer deposits in the quarter rose to basis points and remains low relative to fed funds driven by the high mix of quality transactional accounts most of this quarters basis point rate increase remains concentrated in those cds and consumer investment deposits and together those represent only of our consumer deposits turning to wealth management this business is also impacted by tax payments and normally shows the most relative rate movement because these clients tend to have the most excess cash the previous quarters trend of clients moving money from loweryielding sweep accounts into higheryielding preferred deposits and moving off bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 balance sheet onto other parts of the platform seem to stabilize this quarter and our sweep balances were more modestly down at billion at the bottom right note the global banking deposit stability we ended the second quarter at billion down billion from the first quarter weve now been in this billion to billion range for the past several quarters and these are generally the transactional deposits of our commercial customers that they use to manage their cash flows and while the overall balances have been stable weve continued to see shift towards interest bearing as the fed raised rates one more time during the quarter before pausing in june noninterest bearing deposits were of their deposits at the end of the quarter focusing for a moment on average deposits using slide i really only have one additional point to make while youve seen the modest downtick in deposits for the past several quarters as the fed has removed some accommodation we just want to note that deposits remain above the fourth quarter prepandemic period and as you look at the page every segment relative to prepandemic is up at least consumers up consumer checking is up more than and as noted global banking has been right around billion for the past five quarters and it remains above prepandemic so lets move to slide and well continue the conversation that we began last quarter around management of excess deposits above loans in the top left note the balances in the second quarter of each year since the pandemic began the excess of deposits needed to fund loans increased from billion prepandemic to a peak of trillion in the fall of and as you can see it remains high at the end of june at billion in the top right note that the amount of cash and securities held has increased across time in line with excess deposit trend and youll also note the mix shift over time this excess of deposits over loans has been held in a balanced manner across the period shown with roughly fixed longerdated heldtomaturity securities and the rest has been held in shorterdated availableforsale securities and cash cash and the shorterdated afs securities combined was billion at the end of the quarter and cash at billion is more than twice what we held prepandemic and you should expect to see that come down over time we made these investments given the mix and transactional nature of our customers deposits particularly given the excess deposits built note also in the bottom left chart the combined cash and securities yields continued to expand this quarter and remain meaningfully wider than the overall deposit rate paid thats the result of two things securities book has seen a steady decline since the fall of when we stopped adding to it with less loan funding needs proceeds from security paydowns have been deployed into higher yielding cash and through this action and the increased cash rates the combined cash and security yield has risen further and faster than deposit rates deposits at the end of the quarter were paying basis points while our blend of cash and securities has increased to basis points so over the past year the deposit cost has risen by basis points and the cash and securities yield has improved by basis points and as a reminder this slide focuses on the banking book because our global markets balance sheet has remained largely market funded finally one very last one last very important point that i want to make is on the improved nii of our banking book the nii excluding global markets which we disclose each quarter troughed in the third quarter of at billion and that compares to billion in the second quarter of so almost billion higher on a quarter basis billion per year thats led to a stronger capital position even as we returned capital to shareholders and supplied capital to our customers in the form of loans and other financing capital bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 and then more specifically on the holdtomaturity book the balance of that portfolio declined again billion from the first quarter its down billion since we stopped adding to the book in the third quarter of the market valuation on our holdtomaturity book which is in a negative position worsened billion since march driven by a basis point increase in mortgage rates the oci impact from the valuation of our hedged afs book modestly improved this quarter lets turn to slide and we can focus on net interest income on a gaap or nonfte basis nii in the second quarter was billion and the fully tax equivalent nii number was billion so im going to focus on that fully tax equivalent here nii increased billion from the second quarter of or while our net interest yield improved basis points to this improvement has been driven by rates which includes securities premium amortization partially offset by global markets activity and a billion of lower average deposit balances average loan growth during the period of billion also aided the yearoveryear nii improvement turning to a linked quarter discussion nii of billion is down million or from the first quarter and thats driven primarily by the continued impact of lower deposit balances and mix shift into interest bearing partially offset by one additional day of interest in the period global markets nii increased during the quarter the net interest yield fell basis points in the quarter driven by a larger average balance sheet due to the cash positioning we chose and some higher funding costs this quarters compression we believe was just a little anomalous driven by our decision in late first quarter to position the balance sheet around higher cash levels turning to asset sensitivity and focusing on a forward yield curve basis the plus basis point parallel shift at june was unchanged from march at billion of expected nii over the next months from our banking book and that assumes no expected change in balance sheet levels or mix relative to our baseline forecast and of the sensitivity remains driven by short rates the basis point down rate scenario was unchanged at negative billion let me give you a few thoughts on nii as we look forward we still believe nii for the full year will be a little above billion which would be up more than from full year and this could include third quarter at approximately the same level as second quarter so think billion billion and then fourth quarter somewhere around billion thats a slightly better viewpoint than we had last quarter for the third and fourth quarter with a little more stability closer to the second quarter level and therefore provides a better start point for so lets talk through the caveats around our nii comments first it assumes that interest rates in the forward curve materialize and an expectation of modest loan growth driven by credit card on deposits were expecting modestly lower balances led by consumer and we expect continued modest deposit mix shifts from global banking deposits into interest bearing the past few months have provided us a little more positive outlook around nii given the apparent stabilization of some elements of deposits as well as better pricing and now well see how the rest of the year plays out okay lets turn to expense and well use slide for that discussion second quarter expenses were billion that was down million from the first quarter and as i mentioned the second quarter included million of litigation expense in addition we also saw a little higher revenuerelated expense driven by our sales and trading results those higher costs were more than offset by the absence of the first quarter seasonal elevation of payroll taxes and savings from a reduction in overall fulltime head count bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 now excluding the or so summer interns that we welcomed into our offices over the summer months our fulltime head count was down roughly from the first quarter start point to thats some good work after peaking at in january our summer interns will leave us in the third quarter and hopefully many will return as fulltime associates next summer and at the same time in  we welcomed back about new full time hires as college grads many of whom interned with us last summer and thats a very diverse class of associates who are excited to join the company as we look forward to next quarter we would expect the third quarter expense to more fully benefit from the second quarter head count reduction even as we remain in a mode of modest hiring for clientfacing positions additionally the proposed notice of special assessment from the fdic to recover losses from the failures of silicon valley and signature banks could add billion expense for us billion aftertax and we just remain unsure at this point of timing to record that expense lets now move to credit and well turn to slide net chargeoffs of million increased million from the first quarter and the increase was driven by credit card losses as higher latestage delinquencies flowed through the chargeoffs for context the credit card net chargeoff rate was in  and remains well below the prepandemic rate in the fourth quarter of provision expense was billion in  and that included a million further reserve build thats driven by loan growth particularly in credit card and it reflects a macroeconomic outlook that on a weighted basis continues to include an unemployment rate that rises to north of in on slide we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios on consumer we note we continue to see asset quality metrics come off the bottom and they remain below historical averages overall commercial net chargeoffs were flat from first quarter and within commercial we saw a decrease in ci losses that was offset by an increase in chargeoffs related to commercial real estate office exposures as a reminder commercial real estate office credit exposure represents less than of our total loans and this is an area where weve been quite intentional around our client selection portfolio concentration and deal structure over many years and as a result weve seen npls and realized losses that are quite low for this portfolio in the second quarter we experienced million in chargeoffs on office exposure to write down a handful of properties where the ltv has deteriorated our chargeoffs on office exposures were million in the first quarter we pulled forward some of the office portfolio stats provided last quarter in a slide in our appendix for you and we continue to believe that the portfolio is well positioned and adequately reserved against the current conditions moving to the various lines of business and their results starting on slide with consumer banking for the quarter consumer earned billion on good organic revenue growth and delivered its ninth consecutive quarter of strong operating leverage while we continue to invest in our future note that top line revenue grew while expense rose these segment results include the bulk of the impact of the costs of the regulatory agreements from last week our reported earnings were strong in both periods at billion it understates the success of the business because the prior year included reserve releases while we built reserves this quarter for card growth ppnr grew yearoveryear even with the added cost of the agreements and the revenue growth overcame a decline in bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 service charges that i noted earlier much of this success is driven by the pace of organic growth of checking and card accounts as well as investment accounts and balances as brian noted earlier in addition to the litigation noted expense reflects the continued business investments for growth and as you think about this business remember much of the companys minimum wage hikes and the midyear increased salary and wage moves in impact consumer banking the most and that therefore impacts the yearover year comparisons moving to wealth management on slide we produced good results earning a little less than billion these results were down from last year as asset management and brokerage fees felt the negative impact of lower equity lower fixed income markets and some market uncertainty impacting transactional volume those fees were complemented by the revenue from a sizable banking business and that remains an advantage for us as brian noted earlier both merrill and the private bank continue to see strong organic growth and produced solid client flows of billion since the third since the second quarter our assets under management flows of billion reflect a good mix of new client money as well as existing clients putting money to work expenses reflect lower revenuerelated incentives and also reflect continued investments in the business as we add financial advisors on slide you see the global banking results and this business produced very strong results with earnings of billion driven by growth in revenue to billion coupled with good expense management this business produced strong operating leverage our global transaction services business has been robust weve also seen a higher volume of solar and wind investment projects this quarter and our investment banking business is performing well in a sluggish environment yearoveryear revenue growth also benefited from the absence of marks taken on leverage loans in the prioryear period we saw modest loan growth on average yearoveryear and linked quarter the utilization rates declined and more generally we saw lower levels of demand as we noted earlier the deposit flows have stabilized in the billion to billion over the past several quarters reflecting the benefits of our strong client relationships the companys overall investment banking fees were billion in the second quarter growing over the prior year and linked quarter a good performance in a sluggish environment that saw fees pulls down year overyear provision expense declined yearoveryear as we built more reserve in the prior year expense was held relatively flat yearoveryear even as we drove strategic investments in the business including relationship management hiring and technology costs and additionally comparisons benefit from the absence of elevated expense for some regulatory matters in the second quarter of switching to global markets on slide the team had another strong quarter with earnings growing to billion driven by revenue growth of and im referring to results excluding dvas we normally do the continued themes of inflation geopolitical tensions and central banks changing monetary policies around the globe along with this quarters debt ceiling concerns continued to impact both the bond and equity markets and as a result it was a quarter where we saw a strong performance in both our macro and micro trading business the investments made in the business over the past two years continued to produce favorable results yearover year revenue growth benefited from strong sales and trading results and the absence of marks on leveraged finance positions the last year bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 focusing on sales and trading exdva revenue improved yearoveryear to billion ficc improved while equities was down compared to the second quarter of yearoveryear expense increased primarily driven by investments in the business and revenuerelated costs partially offset by the absence of regulatory matters in the second quarter of finally on slide all other shows a loss of million revenue included million of losses on securities sales and increased volume of solar and wind investment operating losses that create the tax credits for the company as a result of the increased solar and wind tax deal volume and their associated related operating losses our effective tax rate in the quarter was lower at but excluding esg and any other discrete tax benefits our tax rate would have been so with that lets stop there and well open it up for qa question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question today from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning brian and good morning alastair brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc brian can you give us a view from your standpoint of the new well i shouldnt say new but the speech by vice chair barr about the likelihood of capital ratios going up for large banks like your own and then second there was a report today on bloomberg that the capital requirements for holding residential mortgages may go up meaningfully any thoughts on that as well brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp i think broadly stated i think as was said by many people that have held the position over the years the capital in the industry is sufficient and i think theres been a desire to finish up the basel iii those rules will come out we think in a few weeks and like anything else well deal with them we have cet1 ratio our requirements currently are and so we got plenty of capital and its built up so i think from a global competitive standpoint weve got to be careful here because the us industry is the best industry in the world and actually does a lot of good for all the countries in the world including the us and frankly the rules that apply tend to be more favorable to those outside our country and so we got to be careful to maintain a competitive parity but at the end of the day gerard we need to finish this and get this behind us and then the industry will adopt and move forward bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 but theyve got to think through the downside of some of these rules and that they could push stuff outside the industry to nonbanks that have the asset classes across the board are nonbanks including mortgage lending which you referenced half of it goes through nonbanks and those the resilience of those institutions is interesting to watch through cycles and then second thing to have to worry about is competitiveness overall and then also just slowing down the economy a increase in our capital levels would disable us from making about billion of loans at the margin and you want our banks to support the economy like we do so i think all this has to be balanced out as they go to adopt these rules gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup alastair you talked about the balance sheet i think you said basis point increase would lead to over billion in net interest revenue growth over the next months and basis point decrease would lead to a decline of just over billion in revenue can you share with us when do you think you might change what would make you change that position to be liabilitysensitive would you rely on the forward curve or whats the outlook for the balance sheet management that youre looking at now alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well gerard i dont think much has changed for us weve talked about the fact that for us its this idea of balance thats key and if you look at our disclosures around interest rate risk over the course of the past couple years youll see its more balanced both upside and downside and its a narrower corridor over time so that were trying to sustain nii at a higher level for longer thats what were trying to engineer so i think going forward there wont be a lot of change to our philosophy in that regard we feel like were in a pretty good position in terms of balance well be tweaking at the margin but what will largely drive things from here is just normalization of deposits and good oldfashioned loan growth gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you operator well go next to glenn schorr with evercore your line is open brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp good morning glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi good morning so ph dont want to take issue with basis points of operating leverage but i just always like doing a little gut check expenses up i heard all the reasons why a lot of investments the fdic charges coming but i just want to make sure did anything change over the last like decade or so youve been bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 basically flat for life is expenses more of a relative gain relative to revenues or do you think you can keep expenses in and around the same area as you continue to invest thanks brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah so glenn i think alastair gave you a trajectory which if you look at it from fourth quarter last year to fourth quarter this year it gets you relatively flat yearoveryear and as revenues flatten out because the interest rate movements flatten out youll see that as we decline in the quarters that will be strong so as we think about it as we think about the forward we think about the ability to control head count and have expenses continue to come down but theyre going to stay at a level thats relatively consistent where we are now over time and the goal is then to grow revenue faster than expenses weve been doing it for many decades you can see that in our data but the way we do it differs from five years ago to years ago to last year in that the ability to move the branch configuration around when we had branches down to or now its different from to where it might end up and so you should expect us to continue to engineer by applying massive amounts of technology erica saves a lot of transactional activity zelle saves a lot of transactional activity deposits by mobile phone save a lot of activity all that goes on and then what were offsetting with that is from the decade that you talk about we probably went from billion of technology initiatives a year to billion and we went we have a lot more revenues compensated for thinking about in the wealth management business and thats those are things we fight all the time so we expect to manage expenses in line with revenue as we got to we told you that were going to have to start growing expenses at a modest growth rate relative to the revenue growth rate wed outgrow the economy on revenue expense and grow a couple hundred basis points ph lower were kind of going to be back in that mode frankly its just with inflation they kicked up and now ph were flat and back out and then well get back in sync as we move to and beyond alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp and glenn look the only thing i would just add to what brian just said we put up billion in the first quarter we were 16ish this quarter obviously we kind of feel like next quarter just with all the work that weve done around head count and getting firm in the place we want now we feel like were wellpositioned to deliver billion this quarter and when we keep going we think were going to be somewhere around billion or so in  so to brians point number one we like the trajectory now weve shaped the head count over time to get to the place where we want to be and that would compare i think  of last year was billion so when you talk about that sort of flattish idea in an inflationary environment we feel like thats a pretty good way to end this year and a pretty good way to set up for next year glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi totally agree thanks for all that appreciate it bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 operator well take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo your line is open brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp good morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning so i dont think consensus ph has viewed the positive outcome of the third and fourth quarter and i just want to make sure i heard you correctly brian in your opening remark is you expect that eighth quarter of consecutive positive operating leverage to continue so you expect nine quarters or quarters or as long as you can and on the the one reason is just the nii headwind you said it should be kind of flattish in the third quarter and then down from the fourth quarter and you said the commercial loan demand is a little bit less and utilization is less on the other hand you did just give some specific expense numbers and maybe i guess so the specific question is how long do you expect indiscernible are we done with that do you expect that to go and then to what degree do your digital efforts your first three slides slides and play a part in sustaining this positive operating leverage say through and is that a goal or is that an expectation brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp right our goal is always to maintain it and mike you point out that the toughest time is when you have a twist in the interest rate environment and you could see that at the end of and then we get got right back into right after the environment stabilized but i was thinking about the question you asked me a few years ago mike was when nii is coming in are you going to let it fall to the bottom line or are you going to spend it and about 80plus percent of it is falling to the bottom line which shows you how we positioned the franchise from the second quarter of until now as we went through the interest rate the fast interest rate raising so we gave you the specific as you said the specific expense guides by quarter wed expect that to produce operating leverage it will be it gets tougher and then it will get easier as we start to see the stabilization of deposits and loans and loan growth youll sort of routinely come through in the economy frankly shaking through whether were going to have a recession or not and so we feel good about what weve done thats why i tried to give that longer period of time so people have the context its very different environments how weve achieved it sometimes revenue fell and expense fell faster sometimes revenue grew and expense grew but slower and all the different ways so well keep working at it and the key leading indicator we like is weve been able to manage the head count down as alastair said earlier and frankly that is in the face of a turnover rate yearoveryear which has dropped in half which is good because then were not training and hiring as many people and that then sets us up for the second half of the year because that head count benefit has not really come through the pl and will offset some of the other inflation mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 and then as it relates to nii specifically you said that the last few months youre a little bit more confident given stabilization in pricing i guess were not seeing that at every bank right some banks are getting worse some banks are getting better so what is it that gives you confidence on the nii front and the deposit stabilization front alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well look i cant speak to the other banks mike but obviously we know were in a privileged and advantaged position relative to our client base i just think its interesting you look at that global banking set of results over the course of the past yearandahalf in particular thats extraordinary resilience and look  is tax season so look at the wealth management business for example deposits were down billion but we know they paid tax payments of billion billion billion last quarter so theres beginning to be a little more stability and obviously our focus has always been on transactional primary operating and were maybe seeing the benefit of that in some degree but we showed you on slide i think it was page of the earnings deck thats where it is and we showed that last quarter well show it again next quarter but its just the feds engineering this across the board and were just reacting to what we see from our customer base mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator well take our next question from jim mitchell with seaport global your line is open james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe just a followup on deposit behavior i appreciate the comment that you have very low loantodeposit ratio you dont have to chase rate so it feels like betas can stay low but how do you think about how are you thinking about the mix going forward we are seeing nibs come down cd demand is picking up so how are you thinking or what are you seeing in your deposit base with respect to mix brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp i think jim one of the things that as we think about deposits we think about across each of the customer bases and thats what page shows you we think about what do they have cash flows for they have cash to transact and they have cash in excess of that and what happens is depending on the customer segment that cash moves to the market that excess cash moves to the market but the transactional cash is all with us that transactional cash far exceeds for us our loan balances so we have excess transactional cash and a lot of it is low interest checking no interest checking even if its money markets its that sort of cushion that consumers and wealthy people wealthy consumers and average consumers maintain to pay their bills and unexpected expenses so thats what youve seen and that produces a cost to deposits of which is far different than what we see other people have and that you can that just happens bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 now the question is how much moves and as alastair said earlier were aftertax time now where we have a big wealth management payout to the to taxes we also are past the point where people have way past the point indiscernible payments where people have to that money has been in accounts and still is in their accounts to a large degree as we look at them and theyre paying that down slowly so the average balance in our checking accounts has gone from a high of at the peak to or something like that so all that dynamic that youve got to go back and say its the mix of interest bearing and noninterest bearing is actually a little bit of a misnomer because its really what the customer uses the cash for and if they use it to transact and run their household thats a very stable base and thats what the status shows across time and its fundamentally a lot higher than prepandemic so consumer billion prepandemic trillion now checking of that if you look on the pages in deposit descriptions youll see those numbers are page i think it is those numbers will show you how much has stayed in checking thats because we have more customers but more importantly the average consumer through inflation and stuff has more money around and that provides great grist for the mill james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right so do you feel like that mix shift is starting to slow and stabilize brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp well thats what the data on page shows you thats why we show you this level of detail in our customer basis and our lines of business that many dont show you to demonstrate that that difference is there for us and other people may be there too i just cant find it in their data but if you look thats why we show you page so you actually see during the second quarter the weekbyweek average balance movement and as alastair said earlier its very stable in gwim its very stable in global banking even in noninterest bearing piece half of that is excess balance half of it is earnings credit rates through the gts process and so youve got to be careful of that and then you look at the consumer and its bouncing around the high980 billion to trillion depending on the thing and ended at trillion and that happens when payroll happens and all that stuff but thats hugely advantaged pricing 20odd basis points in total for the consumer business and you asked about cds we only have billion of cds so we are our customers are asking for cd rates we give them too its just not the core business and then we have the investment side we push those wealth management flows and the consumer investment flows are part of our deposits moving over to the market when theres excess cash james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right all very helpful thanks a lot operator well go next to chris kotowski with oppenheimer your line is open chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 yeah good morning and thanks for taking the question in the press release the last weeks settlement with bofa cfpb director chopra alleged that you among other things opened customer accounts without consent and im just wondering how is such a thing possible in the postwells fargo era and can you compare and contrast what happened at your firm with what happened at wells brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp frankly chris its we went all through the horizontal review by the occ and all the practices and everything was changed then and this is a small number of accounts that are part of this are from that time period its just indiscernible consumer bureau had to sit sitting around we kind of cleaned it up this quarter so that was that one chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc the time period reflects which time period brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp it reflects up to the current time but the accounts were from and before alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp back when remember controller ph curry did the threephase review of all their firms and they didnt find you can go look at the data and then ultimately up the next controller testified in congress in start of the obama administration after wells and then led into the early part of the trump administration with controller auditing and you can go look at that that was cleared up and weve made the changes in those processes at that time chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc okay thank you thats it for me operator well go next to erika najarian with ubs your line is open brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp hi erika you might be on mute katherine maybe we can come back to erika operator absolutely well go next to betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc couple of questions one on operating leverage that i know you discussed earlier i mean in the past when you had the record number of consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage it seemed like it was being driven ph primarily by a lot of inputs but one of the big drivers was consolidation of branches and now its an investment spend environment in branches so im just wondering if there is a core platform to the company brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp betsy thats kind of what i said earlier its been gotten by different ways in different periods of time but even in the last year the numbers of branches i think dropped about from to and change and so even as we deployed new ones so youre consolidating branches in markets youve been in a long time with lots of branches the atm count continues to drift down but importantly if you go to the digital pages and look at the activity levels by customers and youre speaking mostly the consumer business but it affects all customer bases and you see things like zelle transactions far exceeding checks remember that what that means is we dont have to process a check on the back end of that and so and then and process it push it through so all that continues to grow very quickly and continues to change the overall operating cost in our consumer business our cost of operating plus the cost of pays and deposit is still 130odd basis points or whatever its very strong if we go where the big moves are coming is what were doing in the markets business for example in terms of deeper deeper digitization it was always equity trading was always digitized but the operational process behind that the throughput of the amount of stuff thats going straight through and then whats behind that also in the wealth management customers getting their statements and statements not being delivered to customers home but being delivered electronically is a billion annual benefit thats accumulated over time and so if there was some magic thing you could pull youd pull it but these are a whole bunch of operational excellence ideas it seems inchmeal to the general public but it just as this constant improvement to the platform allows us to constantly manage people down as the percentage of the work done by people always comes down and then now with artificial intelligence and all the enthusiasm leave aside thats in the future the way weve applied it so far has enabled us to do things like our business bankers are more efficient at calling because we use artificial intelligence and programs to tell them which prospects to go to not to tell they know their clients and they run it but which prospects they should approach first so theyre more efficient or the advisor match which has an intelligence base built into it to match the client to an advisor thats you saw the statistics about the numbers of leads leads all this is adding efficiency bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 so yes the branch system has got if it come its come down a slope and that slope is starting to flatten out but in that slope is a massive reinvestment in rehabs and a massive opening and then more and more deposits over top of that which keeps that efficiency going betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so your point on enthusiasm for ai but in your comments it sounds like theres more legs to that that youre anticipating going forward as well is that fair brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah erica we started working on probably eight years ago now to a natural language processing capability that can answer questions that we can make sure the answer was what we want it to be and that ran on our proprietary systems and so its an algorithm that anticipates the answer to the question but it comes from our data and then looks in your account but there was million interactions in the last quarter all of them would have been an email a text a phone call and they were all done through the customer entering it into erica and getting an answer and then going on and started but that will just keep expanding to become a higher and higher functionality it is a start at a methodology which these new programs are far in excess of that but theyre not tested on data they hallucinate in all these wonderful things you hear the experts talk about that have to be carefully controlled before you apply it but erica is using some of the principles and apply it in a very controlled environment and by the way when we do it with our drafting a credit offering memorandum or we do it with a business targeting that we talked about all those are ways that we apply it but its in a very controlled setting so it still has a lot more out there frankly as it gets understood better and how it works better and how it can be add to attribution accountability those types of things have to be built in but erica that was built on from the start betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks and then just one followup on the capital question i know that you are reviewing the scb with the fed but im just trying to understand what kind of expectations you have for buybacks as we look forward here realizing that theres some puts and takes with basel iii but theres some benefits with the scb thanks alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so weve got the final stress capital buffer along with the rest of the industry in august so well wait for that obviously and then betsy i think well likely have to wait for basel iii final clarity thats still moving we dont have the proposed rule yet then we have to wait for the comment period then weve got to wait for the final rule so theres a lot that needs to run before we get full perspective and i think brian said it well i think weve got plenty of capital weve been buying back enough shares to offset the share dilution and weve got flexibility to do a little bit more so the other thing you see over the course of the past year is obviously stress capital buffer last year and we had to add basis points well weve added basis points over the course of the past year and kept return on tangible common equity around while buying back shares so weve got the flexibility to do a little bit of everything but i think we want to see what the final rules look like before we make too many decisions bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah all right thank you operator well go next to ken usdin with jefferies your line is open brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi good morning just one question on credit to follow up your comments so it looks like the card normalization is progressing very gradually days past dues up but only kind of marginally just your points about the consumer having still plenty of cash the economy holding up well just your view on just ongoing normalization of card losses specifically and just anything else that we should be mindful of when we think about credit normalization thank you brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp ken i think you nailed it that sort of being you just you watch our if you look at our chargeoffs for example thats mainly about loan growth and a little bit about the rate picking up just a little bit but its still well below pandemic you can see that and fourth quarter was a great quarter for asset quality in card so it gets back to this idea that the consumer still is in a pretty healthy place you can see that in the unemployment statistics and you can see it in the way that theyre just continuing to spend a little bit more money yearoveryear so i feel like weve been pretty consistent the consumer is pretty resilient that remains the case and were benefiting from it right now in the card experience ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc and thanks and sorry just one more followup on the fee side can you help us understand the card deposit service charges asset management kind of all been stable to slightly lower have the effects that you put through in terms of all the service charges changes and new rewards type of card benefits and all that are we close to getting that run rated any signals of stability in some of those areas brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp so as alastair mentioned earlier theres been a 10year change in how we worked in the overdraft area in the biggest and another set of change were made and fully implemented in the third quarter of last year so theyre in the current run rate its just a yearoveryear comparison this quarter picks up a little bit of prefinal changes to post so if you look at the fdic data i think were down to 30oddmillion dollars a quarter something like that and overdraft fees compared to others there are multiples of that but weve its all through the system its all done bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 and all the changes required of under the recent announcements and stuff have been made for a couple years so its in the run rate so to speak ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc right thanks a lot got it operator operator instructions well go next to charles peabody with portales your line is open charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut good morning a question about your interestbearing deposits with the fed and im looking at page your average balance sheet and those balances were up quite considerably quarteroverquarter and yet your deposit base was relatively flat so i was just curious what the thinking behind that was was it a desire to build liquidity was there arbitrage opportunity for nii what was why build the balances so aggressively alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so if you go back to we talked about this at the end of last quarter charles at the end of last quarter it was an interesting time for the industry and we felt like it was prudent to just build cash during a period like that and so thats what we did and it was obviously an extraordinary period since then as the environment is normalizing id anticipate and i talked about that earlier youll see our cash levels just continue to come back down and so thats all thats happening it was a choice on our part to position with cash and youll begin to see that drift lower now charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut okay as a followup then would that imply that the average balance sheet or more importantly rwas will start to shrink and that would help your capital im just trying to understand the capital alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp no it shouldnt really impact rwas because most of that is sort of low or zero rwa what it should impact is if you look at our net interest yield thats always a question of numerator and denominator and when we increased the cash balances that inflates the denominator for a period of time so that doesnt hurt nii but it does inflate your balance sheet just a little bit so i think as you look forward what you should expect is we just get back to work on both parts of the numerator and denominator well grind away at the nii side and then on the denominator side well have a smaller more efficient balance sheet as the environment normalizes and in the meantime it hasnt hurt nii in any way charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut thank you operator well go to erika najarian with ubs your line is open bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning i am sorry i missed the earlier call on the net interest income trajectory alastair clearly a big focus for your shareholders you mentioned when you were responding to gerards first question that you narrowed the volatility of net interest income and i think that investors im sure are going to start asking you guys and us about the starting point of billion for nii next year i guess were wondering if the fed stays higher for longer and doesnt move how does that impact that billion run rate does that billion capture a cumulative deposit beta that would sort of fully reflect what you would expect to experience through the cycle and then i have a followup question from there alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp so all of our asset disclosures reflect the betas that we believe at the time so that part is always in the disclosures its too early for me to say on were giving guidance for the rest of the year so you have a pretty good sense of what were pretty confident around but last time i looked at the forward curve we had one possibly two hikes this year and then as many as five declines next year so theres a lot between here and there and i think well just as soon take the next three to six months to figure out erika exactly how we feel about erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc totally understand so going back to the down basis point disclosure that would yield to down billion for a full year basis how much of that given that you have exposure to the shape of the curve not just the short end of the curve because of your securities book how much of that is short rates versus long rates in terms of that drop i guess what im trying to figure out is if i simply divide billion by four right that would get me a run rate of billion on a quarterly basis and you mentioned that there are about five cuts in next year but if its not all the short end right and if its halfhalf then i could get to a run rate of billion so just i know theres a lot in there so id just love your thoughts on everything i just said alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well you lost me a little but ill say this weve got its actually down billion its not down billion so thats number one number two you should think about the short end being the vast majority of that and number three part of the reason that i think we feel like weve narrowed this corridor and weve got a little more stability around it is a the securities book and b just as importantly theres been a large rotation into interestbearing and so as rates in a disclosure like this as rates come down one would expect that well be somewhat insulated from that in a different way than we might have two years ago when we didnt have as much interest bearing erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc understood thank you bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 operator well take a followup from mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey i just keep staring at slides and for the digital progress that youre making and trying to connect that to your expenses and operating leverage and i guess where i get to is certainly youre signaling that trends should be good for revenue versus expense or at least youre trying to have that but i still look at the efficiency ratio expenses for revenues of or and then you compare that to the levels from and when it was and so i guess the question is do you guys with all these digital initiatives and progress and again i appreciate the disclosure on these slides and it would be great to have more of your peers disclose that all that progress why cant you get back to levels from or or at least below and if so how long would it take brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp mike the linkage of the digital activity to produce the many quarters of operating leverage at last years et cetera is an absolutely ph buy and betsy asked about the branch count and all the things weve done the efficiency ratio for us is has a plain element which is the wealth management business is a big part of our revenue base and has a different operating dynamic because of how its reported as you well know the revenue has the cost of compensation the percent of revenue is high and we basically make on for every past the revenue takeout which the advisor compensation level and well continue try to improve that and make the advisor more efficient and things like that but thats a major change we improved yearoveryear and frankly were still cleaning out some pandemicrelated costs and things like that so well continue to drive that down and as net interest income has come up and a more important part of the business that helps push that efficiency ratio back down and thats the goal i mean youre describing what we go to work and do every day and the way we do it is the application of technology across the board and then removing work from the system and bringing that out and bringing it to the bottom line and then making the investments we did to make it happen again so well continue to do that but the efficiency ratio remember for us if you go line of business is bestinclass its just we have a bigger mix towards the wealth management business than most other people mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and let me try one more time on erica and i guess it could be bank of america ai maybe ph if youre keeping out your erica business but you guys highlight a number of hours it saves in manual labor and do you have a connection of that to what that saves in expenses or what that could save or should save over the next few years brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah it will continue to allow us to do more with the same amount so if you think about to now mike remember the number of customers who do their core checking ph list is up so its not a and bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 18jul2023 that is a lot of people its million more customers doing transactions a month and all thats going through on a relatively flat expense base and weve been weve had with inflation and wages and things weve absorbed all that as part of the thing and thats why the costs have changed but the reality is we flatten that back out and then well keep driving it back down and that if you look at the cost to deposits which is the cost of running all that as a percentage of deposits you can see that on the consumer page it still maintains a nice break against the rate that we receive for the deposit balances so were working on it simply put we had people in the consumer business a decadeplus ago we now have ph going and it comes down a little bit every quarter even though were putting new branches with an average of to people in depending on the location and things like that going on and so that just keeps going in the right direction now if you take that across other things in our operations group the team there continues to have flat head count to down head count and we invest that back in the technology side for more developers 20000odd on our payroll plus another are third party that go through frankly the top line and so we keep trying to drive it in to make us more efficient so all the principles youre saying are right and we expect it to continue to have a benefit mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator there are no further questions in queue at this time id like to turn the program back over to brian moynihan for any additional or closing remarks brian t moynihan chair chief executive officer bank of america corp thank you and for joining us all as you think about the quarter strong profitability strong return on tangible common equity or better continue to drive organic growth continue to drive operating leverage and we gave you clarity on the future path of expenses in nii but above all else in the quarter where weve had a strong capital markets performance and a strong investment banking
