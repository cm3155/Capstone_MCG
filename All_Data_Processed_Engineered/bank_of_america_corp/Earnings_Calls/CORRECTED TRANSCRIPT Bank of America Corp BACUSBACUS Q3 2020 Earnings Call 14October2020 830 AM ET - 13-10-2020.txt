that take it away brian brian t moynihan chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp thank you lee and thank all of you for joining and i hope all of you are staying safe were going to begin on slide and today before paul takes you through the detail in the financials i thought id give you some thoughts on the first three quarters of and how were driving for you here at bank of america as an opening comment the economy and the markets this year have been defined more than anything else by the impact of the global health care crisis this has created a stimulus path for the recovery as we have said early on here at bank of america and what our data continues to suggest is that we are seeing a return to the fundamentals of a generally sound underlying economy but we wont get there until we have fully addressed the health care crisis and its associated effects these effects have been lessened by the monetary and fiscal policies and by the core health of the us consumer given those policies there are three key themes that id like to comment on one is the economy generally what we see in our data and the impact of the projected path on the economys earnings and the companys earnings and prospects going forward the second is how we continue to think about and manage the risk resulting from the economic downturn and the subsequent beginnings of the recovery and the third is how we are making progress given all that backdrop on our core strategies before i touch on these items just a brief summary of the quarter overall solid performance given the operating backdrop we face we earned around billion after tax or per share we ended the quarter with a capital ratio of versus minimum for the third period of this pandemic weve earned more than twice our dividends attesting to the strong balance sheet and security of this company the operating environment continues to require more operational excellence than ever before it requires delivery of immediate technology capabilities across our franchise from our group of talented teammates it also has to deliver a customer experience that can be redefined on a daily basis it also has to meet customer demands which ebb and flow given the daily events it has required extra costs to do the right thing to protect our teammates our clients and our franchise all while processing higher transaction levels and dealing with volatility and the high volumes that come from it it requires indiscernible work on delivery on a daytoday basis this results in expense that remains elevated this quarter thats expenses from covid however our disciplined expense management remains well intact we have turned the corner on these covid costs as we see forward in the fourth quarter we see the costs coming back down in the company that is evidenced by the drop this quarter of in our head count on a quartertoquarter basis and paul will talk more about the path going forward in a minute so lets start with the economy and its impact on our company we saw another partial restoration of the us economy we saw that in our outside data and we saw it in the large base of spending in our customers as you think through the quarters in the first quarter our customer spending was impacted as we hit march after a strong start to the year however for the quarter our customers still spent more than they did in the first quarter of bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 the second quarter saw the worst of the crisis in terms of spending it was a drop in gdp and the spending fell deeply in april but started to recovery as stimulus ppp and other monetary policy kicked in into may and june and also the reopenings began in the third quarter weve seen a full restoration of spending by bank of america customers when compared to last year overall the customer payment levels in september were larger than september year to date theyll cross trillion in spending at bank of america customers have spent more than they did last year you could see that on slide in the appendix this has occurred even as some of the summer stimulus programs have run their course our own bank of america economic experts predict a sharp rebound in third quarter gdp of around so simply put were back to 90plus where we were in terms of gdp size so what are we seeing as we turn in october the spending by our consumers is still solid about ahead of last year deposits remain elevated and continue to grow in consumer banking and global wealth management in global banking deposits are flattish as customers continue to make choices about liquidity we are seeing loan demand stabilize and we may have seen a trough in september in commercial utilization rates have come down below prepandemic levels last year as the economy continues to grind forward we believe we will see some demand recover over the next few quarters in consumer lending card balances appear to be stabilized and credit spending continues to grow and we are growing at new accounts in our consumer card businesses new accounts are growing in our auto lending business and our mortgage business is stable so this view of loan demand and more stability of balances the ability to redeploy some cash balances given the now lengthier stability of customer deposits leads us to believe that the third quarter was a trough quarter for nii and paul will cover more of that later the second topic i want to touch about is going to slide on the risks we continue to remain focused on all the risks whether in market and trading risk credit operation and reputational risks given the incredible volumes and unusual working conditions that were all in going back to the first quarter volatility the concern was obviously market risk weve handled this market risk well and again for this quarter the team made trading profits on every single day our capital levels in the quarter are at historically high levels as i stated before and liquidity stands at over billion credit risk is the current focus in this quarter and you can see the highlights of that on slide chargeoffs declined for the quarter reserve build this quarter was on the commercial side mostly thats due to the specified industries that are facing still not being fully open and the length of time it may be till they reopen consumer card release reserves for example we believe we are staying ahead of the commercial risk by aggressively reviewing our portfolios over the last two quarters in each quarter weve done review of all the middle market and business banking portfolios to ensure we have strong internal ratings integrity and focus on the ability to pay as well as just having liquidity you can see an increase in the criticized exposure that comes from those views and reratings but it was more focused on the certain industries and paul will touch on that in the first couple weeks weve seen the criticized assets come back down as some of those clients refinance meanwhile overall nonperforming loans remain around billion with commercial basically flat to last quarter and consumer growing around million overall the balance of nonperforming loans remains at a modest basis points to loans this is a testimony to the decade of responsible growth this company has engaged in bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 importantly the deferral story which we talked about the last couple quarters is largely over we only have customers remaining on deferral at the end of september of the billion in total consumer balances that remain on deferral billion are mortgage loans those are well secured and low loantovalue and have ph among many other positive attributes including to of them are in the wealth management business all are accounted for in our reserves based on the expected losses indiscernible interesting both card delinquencies and mortgage delinquencies are down in terms of dollar amount and percent yearoveryear having said all this around credit we dont expect to see meaningful increase in net chargeoffs till mid next year and we expect that the reserve builds are behind us which means the pl impact of those losses should be in our financials already so then the question becomes after managing the risk is have we been investing in the company at the same time and that you can see as you move to slide through our continued investments in technology we continue to improve our platforms across the board drive operational excellence invest in the future all while growing core customer client households throughout the quarter in our commercial businesses were now actively ph prospecting again having done the reviews i spoke about early fully assessing the credit quality of existing clients and then focusing our production work on the prospects we know we can get around the country in our consumer business we continue to grow net core checking households by about yearoveryear and billionplus in checking balances we saw a strong growth in merrill edge our consumer customer investment platform by billion in assets yearoveryear we see depth and penetration on digital engagement across the whole consumer business in our wealth management business even as our advisors work from home our private bankers and financial advisors grew households again this quarter in fact we reached a record new client balances of trillion we also continue our investments in our market expansion in the crisis we added new financial centers in the quarter and continue to offset that number with closures that were preplanned before the pandemic ph but here we continue to change the companies is in the digital capabilities not only in consumer but across the board in every business this digital enablement is the trifecta of better customer engagement and client delight deeper penetration of products and services and operating efficiency and with the rollout of a new industry feature like this weeks life plan announcement where we now have customers who have already filled out a life plan financial plan over the last couple weeks you can see these digital engagement highlights on slide this quarter we had billion in total digital logins in our consumer business ericas up to million users zelle is at million users importantly you see at the bottom of the list the digital engagement of our wealth management customers through that digital platform merrill lynch and the private bank are again proving that were high touch and high tech this ranges from how we provide advice and personal research to how our clients have interacted with us to do things like just deposit checks and that was up dramatically over the quarter as our advisory clients embraced our new digital capabilities in the middle of the page you see the statistics for our commercial business for our products called cashpro and cashpro mobile this makes our clients lives easier and saves them operating costs and here in the cashpro area we rolled out a bunch of new features and user interfaces and capabilities last week to allow companies and bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 company treasurers to better manage their money around the world in all kinds of currencies and all kinds of environments so in summary billion in aftertax earnings and a solid quarter progress on the economic recovery progress on the risk but most importantly underlying that business strong growth in the business side in the customer side of the business which is what we do and will continue to do it in perpetuity with that let me turn it over to paul paul m donofrio chief financial officer bank of america corp thanks brian im starting on slide and together in most periods my earnings remarks are focused on year overyear comparisons but this quarter many of my comments will be directed towards comparisons against  as most investors we speak with are more interested in our progress quarter over quarter as we work sequentially through the health crisis and given covid has made yearoveryear comparisons less relevant  net income of billion or per share compares to billion or in  the earnings improvement was driven by lower provision expense as we modestly added to the reserves for credit losses in  compared to the more significant increase in reserves in  versus  the lower provision expense was mostly offset by lower nii and higher cost of litigation and costs of the covid environment lower rates and loan balances caused nii compression which i will discuss in a moment the linked quarter decline in noninterest income was driven by the more robust trading and ib environment in  as well as a million gain on the sale of mortgages recorded in  while down linked quarter fees from capital markets in both market ph banking and investment banking were solidly up yearoveryear at billion investment banking fees were the secondbest quarter in the companys history ph brian did our progress in activities levels across many of our businesses and that showed up in increased levels of fees which helped to mitigate the linked quarter decline in capital markets revenue  saw card income and service charges move higher from the more heavily impacted  levels we also experienced higher asset management fees as the market improved and we grew net new households again this quarter turning to expenses they were higher in  than  driven by three things first we built litigation reserves for litigation with respect to some older matters second we had an increase in covidrelated costs and third this is the first quarter in which we recorded merchant servicing expense it is important to point out that the increase from recording merchant servicing expense and even some of the increase in covidrelated costs were associated with increases in reported revenue which obviously helps defray their impact on profits and with respect to the linked quarter change in pretax preprovision income i would also point out that the billion of the decline was driven by two more abnormal items the prior period loan sale gain of million and this quarters elevated litigation expense of about million in addition given a reversal in uk tax policy our results included a million positive adjustment to our tax expense as we revalued our uk deferred tax asset that had been previously written down our rotce was and roa was basis points moving to the balance sheet on slide we ended the quarter little changed from  at trillion in total assets the main point i want to make about the balance sheet is the redeployment of some of our excess liquidity out of cash and reverse repo and into securities cash and reverse repo declined by about billion from  while security levels rose by a similar amount this will help offset nii compression from lower reinvestment rates in bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 coming quarters the only other notable point on the balance sheet was the decline in loans driven by customer paydowns shareholders equities increased billion as earnings were more than twice the amount of dividends paid with respect to regulatory ratios importantly this quarter we received approval of our updated model to calculate operational risk rwa which resulted in a billion reduction in our advanced rwa a decline in loans drove rwa even lower under the advanced approach the improvement in rwa and capital improved our cet1 ratio under advanced from ph to the decline in loans improved rwa under standardized as well but given the larger decline in our cet ratio under the advanced approach standardized became our governing approach again this quarter our cet1 ratio under the standardized approach improved to which is basis points above our minimum requirement and translates into a billion capital cushion above that requirement our tlac ratios also increased and remain comfortably above our requirements before leaving the balance sheet i want to point out a couple of things with respect to loan and deposit trends the charts on slide and show a fiveyear trend as we wanted to give you a longer perspective on the growth of loans and deposits that incorporated more normal environments given the nearterm disruption caused by the pandemic overall yearoveryear total loans grew and the lines of business grew commercial loans rose billion in  and then declined in each of the next two quarters yearoveryear average global banking loans are only down in consumer banking loans grew yearoveryear as the decline in higheryielding card loans was more than offset by the addition of ppp loans and residential mortgages in terms of the path forward a few perspectives first our middle market utilization rate a year ago was and it has now declined to business banking has gone from to we believe these rates are bottoming and should begin to move higher over the next few quarters if the economy continues to grind forward with respect to credit card spending and cash volumes declined materially during the first half of the year driving balances lower the good news is that credit card spending continued to gradually improve in  but remains significantly below prepandemic levels in certain categories such as travel and entertainment outside of ppp loans where government forgiveness will drive declines we remain optimistic that the larger loan declines of the past couple of quarters are behind us absent a resurgence in covid cases further impacting the economy on slide we provide the same trends by line of business for deposits brian already made a number of points on deposits and you can see the tremendous yearoveryear growth in every line of business i will just add that in each line of business rate paid on deposits is at or below the rate paid to customers in before the fed began raising rates so we think our strong deposit growth reflects our customers overall experience with us turning to slide and net interest income on a gaap nonfte basis nii in  was billion billion on an fte basis net interest income declined million from  and billion from  the drop from  was driven by lower loan balances and decline in interest rates across the yield curve which was more pronounced on an average basis than on a spot basis given the decline in mortgage rates during the quarter we saw an extraordinary level of mortgage prepayments this resulted in higher bond premium writeoffs and drove a little more than half of the decline in nii for  compared to  the increase in prepayments negatively impacted the yield on our securities by basis points bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 and the overall net yield on the company by basis points the lower longend rates also continue to impact the reinvestment of maturing securities lowering our nii and yield the other primary driver of the linked quarter decline in nii was the lower commercial and credit card balances previously noted while lower shortend rates did reduce the cost of both deposits and longterm debt this ph funding off decline was mitigated by yields on variable rate loans also repricing lower we also want to point out that we saw a modest benefit in  from the redeployment of some of our excess liquidity into securities this should aid nii more in subsequent quarters given the sharp decline in nii the net interest yield declined by basis points from  on the bottom right we show the drivers of this net interest yield decline i already noted the bond premium impact and you can see the other drivers on the chart in terms of forward nii guidance there are a couple of caveats worth emphasizing such as rates not moving lower than  levels and the economy not taking a big step backwards from negative covid developments which could drive loan demand lower again having said that we believe  likely will be the bottom for nii and we are optimistic it will move higher in let me provide a few thoughts on why we feel good about nii moving forward first commercial loan utilization rates are at historically low levels and with the economy expected to slowly grind forward we are optimistic that over the next quarter or two you could see ci loan demands start picking up as brian noted we are also seeing spending on credit cards slowly picking up so with stable customer repayment rates we could see a seasonal lift in card balances as well at the very least we are not expecting the continued large declines seen over the past two quarters in outstanding commercial or card loans in addition some combination of refinancing ph fatigue and stabilization of longend rates should result in less bond premium writeoffs than currently impacting nii and lastly as i mentioned the deployment of cash through higher yielding securities will aid nii in the future we believe these factors taken together in the near term will mitigate the ongoing negative effects of nii on higher yielding assets maturing or paying off and being replaced with lower yielding ones turning to slide and expenses expenses this quarter were billion which are billion higher than  first about million of the increase is from elevated litigation expense the remaining increase is split between higher covid costs and merchant processing expenses which are not higher but just accounted for differently this quarter following the jv dissolution the elevation in our net covid expense was driven by costs associated with processing unprecedented levels of claims for unemployment insurance through our commercial card product and continued costs of supporting ppp loans both of these activities have revenue benefits which helped offset some of the costs with respect to expense in  we dont expect to have a similar amount of litigation expense and we dont expect a repeat of the  activity with respect to processing unemployment insurance claims therefore we believe absent other unexpected changes our  expense number should be in the neighborhood of around billion turning now to asset quality on slide our total net chargeoffs this quarter were million or basis points of average loans while net chargeoffs benefited from government stimulus and loan deferral programs it also reflected years of adherence to our responsible growth model the million decline in net chargeoffs was driven by lower credit card losses the loss rate on credit card declined to basis points of average loans bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 provision expense of billion driven by a million net reserve build this quarter while total reserves grew modestly from  total loan balances declined billion increasing our allowance as a percentage of loans to leases to i would also note the coverage ratio for every loan category increased in  with credit card now just north of total commercial loans at and cre at in terms of the process and key variables with respect to setting our reserve which is something everyone seems to have great interest in we continue to include a multiple of downside scenarios the weighting of these scenarios produced an outlook that gdp could return to its level sometime in late the weighting also produced an unemployment assumption of nearly as we exit  and a year later so our unemployment assumptions for the end of is higher than the current unemployment and the time to return to positive gdp improved compared to last quarter at the end of the day we build commercial reserves for exposures to industries more heavily impacted by covid and less reserve coverage in other areas nearly unchanged as we felt despite the macro improvement there is still too much uncertainty around unemployment expiration of stimulus the duration of the pandemic to reduce total reserves on slide we break out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios on the consumer front covid effects on asset quality continue to remain benign consumer net chargeoffs declined million driven by a decline in card losses 30day delinquencies and npls rose from very low levels as deferrals ended and began to enter those metrics as brian noted consumer deferrals have materially declined with only billion remaining which are mostly consumer real estaterelated and have strong collateral values credit card deferrals have declined for more than billion at the end of  to around million now and more than of the accounts with deferrals that have expired have made their first payment commercial net chargeoffs were flat with  but included higher commercial real estate losses primarily related to mall exposures which were offset by lower cirelated losses overall given the environment the asset quality of our commercial book remains solid with of exposures excluding small business either investment grade or collateralized our reservable criticized exposure metric continues to be the most heavily impacted by covid and increased this quarter by billion from  it should be no surprise to you that exposures in the hotel and airline industries led that increase however its also worth noting that our commercial npls which are lower rated than criticized are still only billion flat compared to  and remained low at only basis points of loans with respect to commercial real estate which is an area of focus given covids potential impact on the sector we feel very good about our exposure and reserve coverage today outstanding loans for commercial real estate are billion which represents of total loans for bank of america and less than of total equity these percentages are very low compared to the broader industry of these loans are either investment grade or secured by collateral we have a diverse mix of exposure led by office space at about a quarter of the cre portfolio multifamily retail hotels each just north of of our cre exposure and our exposure is also regionally diverse with only one area of the country representing more than of the cre loan book currently we have a little more than million in this book on npl status and year to date we have seen less than million in net chargeoffs and we hold nearly of allowance against these loans bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 ill just take just a moment to go a little deeper on our exposure to hotels as an example of our measured approach over the years within cre we have about billion outstanding loans related to hotel properties that is less than of overall loans with respect to asset quality of these loans of them are collateralized with many having precovid ltvs around to that can weather a meaningful price decline and while of these loans are classified as reservable criticized only million are npls okay turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on slide in the interest of time i will keep my comments brief on the lines of business and just hit the highlights on the slides we normally provide in the first half of the year compared to our other segments consumer banking was the most heavily impacted by covid as it bore the brunt of revenue disruption from lower rates and lower consumer spending as well as the need for customer assistance it also bore a large dislocation in credit costs not because of realized losses but instead from establishing reserves for losses which are projected to materialize over the coming quarters in  we did not add reserves and you can see the improvement in profits versus  i would also note that expected credit losses have yet to materialize in fact we saw reserves in net chargeoffs decline from  we also saw improvement in consumer fees as activity and account growth improved and we saw less demand for customer assistance through fee waivers we also believe this quarter may be the turning point with respect to covid expense as covid costs decline we expect to see the benefit of a more digitally engaged customer base we earned billion in consumer banking in  versus roughly million in  but remained well below last years results as nii fees and expenses have all been pressured by the pandemic it is worth pointing out that both our rates paid and cost of deposits declined as deposits grew and we handled more transactions but were more productive as a result of digital processing client momentum in this business continued to show strength around deposits and investment flows while loan growth continued to be impacted by declines in credit cards lets skip to wealth management on slide and and i will refer to both of those pages as i speak here again the impact of lower rates on our larger deposit book resulted in lower nii impacting an otherwise solid quarter with positive aum flows market appreciation and solid deposit and loan growth net income of million was down from  driven by a decline in revenue as well as higher noninterest expense net income improved from  on lower provision expense as reserve building subsided with respect to revenue lower nii more than offset improvement in asset management fees expenses increased in comparisons against both periods driven by revenue related expense and investments in our sales force merrill lynch and the private bank both continue to grow clients as we remained a provider of choice for affluent clients as relative to the great work of our advisors to provide advice and guidance in these challenging times yeartodate weve added nearly net new households in merrill lynch and more than net new relationships in the private bank client balances rose to a record trillion up yearover year driven by the rebound in markets as well as positive client flows lets move to our global banking results on slide global banking results continued to reflect covidrelated impacts of both lower interest rates and higher credit costs in the quarter mitigating these impacts the business continued to produce strong investment banking results the business earned million in  which included adding million to credit reserves net income declined billion from  split relatively evenly bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 between lower revenue and higher credit costs the decline in revenue was driven by lower nii as a result of lower rates within noninterest income ph taxedadvantaged leasing revenue was lower while ib fees rose as i mentioned investment banking fees for the company were billion and they were up yearoveryear an increase in noninterest expense yearoveryear primarily reflected investments in the platform including our merchant services business while average deposits are up nicely yearoveryear average deposit levels declined from  as we continued to lower rates and some customers chose other uses for their liquidity rate paid on deposits are now lower than the levels seen at the end of just before rates began to rise average loans yearoveryear were modestly lower reflecting the paydown noted earlier but its worth noting that we have seen positive trends on spreads albeit at lower origination levels switching to global markets on slide results reflect solid yearoveryear improvement in revenue from sales and trading but also the expected decline from the robust levels of  in addition this quarter we saw an increase in both revenue and expense associated with processing an unprecedented level of claims for unemployment insurance this is another important activity during this pandemic period whereby we get money in the hands of those who need it on behalf of the states unfortunately the cost as in many other coviddriven activities were quite a bit higher than the fees received we expect both to reduce substantially next quarter as i usually do i will speak about the segments results excluding dva this quarter net dva was a loss of million so global markets produced million of earnings in  modestly higher than  yearover year revenue was up on improved investment banking fees higher sales and trading and the fees for processing unemployment claims the expense increase was driven by higher claims process costs as well as higher brokers clearing and execution costs associated with higher activity in asia sales and trading contributed billion to revenue increasing yearoveryear driven by a improvement in equities and a improvement in ficc the improvement in ficc results was driven by performance in mortgage and fx while the strength in equities was driven by client activity in asia finally on slide we show all other which reported a profit of million compared to  the improvement in net income is driven primarily by the prior year billion pretax impairment charge associated with our merchant servicing jv compared to  audio gap reflects the million tax adjustment associated with our uk deferred tax asset the tax expense improvement versus linked quarter was mostly offset by s million gain from the sale of mortgages and the higher litigation expense in  in  the tax rate reflected the benefit of the tax adjustments as well as the ongoing benefit of taxadvantaged investments in  absent unusual items we expect the effective tax rate to be around reflecting the impact of tax credits relative to pretax income and just a reminder these taxadvantaged investments which are driven by our commitment to esg also result in pretax partnership losses both in consolidated other income and these partnership losses are normally seasonally high in  okay with that lets jump to qa bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions and we can take our first question from glenn schorr with evercore your line is open glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much so youve historically been incredibly stable in trading and again you are this quarter but i guess i have a question to rehash on during times like this you have some peers that will have bigger spikes and then theyll come back down to earth at other times and im just curious if you could talk about youre steady but youre not seeing the same spikes is that your risk tolerance is it a ccar stress testing thing is it a mix of business and is it conscious meaning are you investing too close on ph gaps just curious if you could talk about that from the markets perspective thanks paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp sure well look again our sales and trading results were solid with total revenue up yearoveryear equities is up ficc is up we had no days with trading losses again this quarter if you kind of look at i dont really like to talk about competitors but every competitor is going to have a different business mix and many of our competitors i will say take more risk in one quarter or another clearly that can create some differences in relative performance we dont really focus that much on individual quarters but instead we look at results over longer time periods and as noted sales and trading is up year to date i would also note that were gaining share we think in equities and other parts of our markets business and we certainly have gained share in investment banking and theres been quarters where weve done better i mean than some of our peers go back to  when youll see in equities where we basically did better than all our peers so were staying focused on the medium to long term were investing in the business and were taking share glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi fair enough maybe just one followup on you noted obviously loan demand stabilized trough quarter for nii dont expect to add to reserves deferrals mostly over and you have a billion capital cushion im curious what you feel is a more natural number at some point well get off by that suspension so whats a more natural number for your capital cushion and what might be your intentions on what to do with that excess because it feels like organic growth youre going to make more money than you can file into organic growth for a while brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp thats a good list to work with in terms of citing the things and yes we are generating twice our dividend or more have been for every quarter even when we put up the reserves even while the rate structure hit so trough quarter for nii last quarter expenses coming down built the reserves wed expect that well get through the stress test and then well start to go into capital redeployment as we did before bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 and our general goal is to run about basis points over the minimum so for us thats which is another reason why the mix of business is so important to us that youd referenced earlier is remember we had a stress capital buffer that was and we didnt use all of it but so we got plenty of cushion here from an operational basis in terms of the ability to use capital management once were free and clear glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks brian operator and we can move next to jim mitchell with seaport global your line is open james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe one for brian given the pressure in the industry and your scale advantages is there an opportunity here to kind of press your advantage a little bit and try to accelerate market share and sort of what that might mean for expenses if you did brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah and look i think weve been able to push market share so if you look at the fdic data i think were up or basis points in aggregate deposit market share june to june and everybody had the benefit for the monetary policy but what we watch is where the market share is going to stick to the ribs so think about it in terms of adding commercial bankers which weve added think about it in terms of entering new markets and branches this year weve entered several new markets if you look at the deposits in these markets that weve been open a while theyre million per branch moving to million per branch and think about the wealth management business adding financial advisors so we just keep driving that total and if you think about we have trillion in deposits billion plus in consumer but a lot of other people forget that we also have a personal business in gwim with billion plus in deposits so we have pressed our advantage and in consumer those that have been around the company we reposition the consumer business from ph primary checking to plus and thats a million new checking accounts year to year or something like that in a year where weve been shut down for a couple quarters from some of the activity at the branches and thats strong performance were pressing that all the time the magic has been weve been able to manage expenses between billion billion a quarter now youve got to add the merchant to it ph to the billion and still invest at that rate look at that page on the digital growth its very strong our zelle indiscernible with all the zelle transactions erica indiscernible and then life plan this quarter we put out a new product that you can do your own financial plan and a half million customers in a couple weeks so across the board in each element of the franchise investing billion in technology so were pressing the advantage organically every day and youre seeing that come out our deposit market share across the board has grown and our loan share where we compete has continued to grow and our gts business has continued to grow and as paul said our investment banking has grown and were keeping driving it bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc so thats helpful and so you feel comfortable that you can still i mean add the million to the billion the billion so billion billion you still feel comfortable doing all that and keeping expenses in that range brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah and thats this operational excellence platform if you look at whatever page that was look at all those quarters and you go back even before that and think of all the investments weve ph made and make and i think thats three years we show you maybe so think of billion to billion in technology development code development new initiatives in that period of time and expenses stayed relatively flat think about redeploying probably to or new branches across that three to four years in markets weve never been think about refurbishing weve done or branches this year so far weve opened into new market et cetera so just this quarter just this literal quarter we opened branches in new market so were pressing our advantage and the board asked me and wed have the discussions with our major shareholders could you press it harder and the answer is if i talk to marketing people sure theyd want to spend more money on marketing but i think we spend enough to do the trick and drive it in a way that itd stick to the ribs james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay great thanks operator and we can move next to betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp hey bets betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks for the time i wanted to dig in a little bit on the points you were making paul earlier about the cash and the redeployment into securities and i just wanted to get a sense as to for how much of a nim uplift do you think youre going to get from that and then what percentage of cash have you used already what is going to be guiding you on how much more to use here and is there a limit for how much cash youre willing to redeploy into securities bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah sure so in the third quarter we deployed about billion of our cash into mortgagebacked securities and treasuries over the third quarter and our weighted average basis between the treasuries and mortgage backed securities that probably produced a lift relative to cash of about close to a percentage point on what we deployed you didnt see a lot of that come through in  because of the timing of those purchases throughout the quarter youll see more of that impact in  with respect to future deployment we have some firepower left i hesitate to give you a number but call it maybe another billionish im not telling you were going to deploy all of that in the fourth quarter were continuing to assess deposits and well likely continue to deploy more cash very likely to continue to deploy more cash into securities moving forward but no answer right yet exactly how much the size and the pace of that will be influenced by a number of judgments including things like loan demand and customer deposit behavior and well also balance the mix of purchases as we assess the tradeoffs between capital liquidity and earnings betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and the percentage point youre talking about is a yield lift on the portfolio versus cash paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp that is if you compare what were buying mortgagebacked securities treasuries to what we were earning in cash or repo the pickup in yield on that investment is a little less than betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah okay yeah i got it all right and then maybe if you could speak a little bit to both yourself and brian to the discussion around the ci loan utilization and i get that were at a historic low or close to the lows in utilization but what is it that youre seeing in your customer discussions that gives you an expectation that you could see that start to lift in and into brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp so what we see is it just hasnt been going down it kind of ran down throughout the second quarter and the first quarter everyone panicborrowed people drawing their lines and then it ran down and so some of these companies are making more cash flow than theyve ever made and so what youre starting to see is a couple things one is in areas like auto retail dealers and stuff the inventories are going to have to build or else theyre going to have nothing to sell so theyll build those back up youre seeing it in suppliers of parts and things theyre building their inventories because theyre seeing more final demand on the products that sustain and i think thats the key so its more just talking to people and seeing that frankly that they brought it down about as far as they can from sort of the daytoday operational basis when you start to think of million and under revenue companies running the numbers that paul gave you which is what we call business banking they cant get it much lower than that because theyre paying their payrolls and doing their things and so theyre going to start to build back up as bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 they start to expand to meet their client demands and so thats what gives us confidence just the conversations that weve had with them and talking to them in these deep reviews weve done its been clear that theyre feeling better that the core demand from may to june to july to august to september picks up the only big question when were wrong on all this in terms of loan balance is really in the high end and who has access to markets and how deep that goes in the middle markets which we make fees on the investment banking side but that can move loan balances around as you well know ph betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah i got it okay thats helpful thanks very much operator and we can move next to mike mayo with wells fargo your line is open brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi this is a followup to you guys pressing your advantage i mean its good news bad news good news is youre growing households your deposits for the corporation are ph on course yearoveryear your digital banking is growing so thats great and your ph award is your nii has gotten crushed right so its a shortterm versus longterm tradeoff so as you look at an environment with lower rates for longer as you acquire these customers have you changed your assumptions for lifetime value because i assume you eventually want to monetize the benefits of these relationships but its just not happening yet brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp so i think mike you have to think about it two ways one is for the new customers coming on bringing us billion in incremental checking deposits yearoveryear that is money coming on at basically zero that you can redeploy as paul said so theres a value to that incrementally to the company the question is when you have that quick falldown of rates that we had you have to kind of get underneath to come out the other side as you well know but look the value of the deposit franchise is represented by having the core household relationships and thats where you see the things move forward so what are we seeing were seeing a rebound in our auto lending were seeing a rebound in our card lending those are coming because we have the core relationships that are digitally inactive of the sales are coming digitally and that helps us grow and then you think about just on the consumer look if you look at page on the investment side youre seeing that build up by billion yearoveryear billion linked quarter so that materialized the balance and the good news is youve looked at the fee structure across the platforms and the different things youre seeing the fees start to come back up which is just core activity so were at we only have million in total quarterly bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 deposit interest costs so it can only go from million to zero theres not much left in it it was billion i think last year this quarter so weve brought that down and now we have just got to grow the volume back up and youre seeing that start to happen and thats what gives paul comfort ph from the full projections and its the depth of relationship its not any single product as you well know and were pressing the advantage because frankly even in a low rate environment more core deposit customers more core checking accounts and deposits in addition to our wealth management business in gwim more gts business well make more money on ph you make in a twist of rates in a given quarter but just think back we had this discussion in the mid you saw the earnings come up even before the rates moved mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc are there ways to we know this is the lynchpin to a customer relationship its just getting value ph today for that relationship and you are mentioning the different products is there a way to think about charging more fees or something if you have a low rate environment like this again just getting your moneys worth for all the effort you put in to gather these new households brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah well i think not penalty fees clearly mike because that just is a bad customer experience because the other thing is the attrition rate in the book has dropped very low because of the high quality customer experience our team delivers and it gives you the permission to do more with them so penalty fees i think are not the way to go but core account fees for the structures are there but the reality is that most of the our preferred book which is of the consumer deposits by definition is way above any minimum requirement for fees and so youve got the volume youre getting of consumer deposits in a book that was only about of the customers so you make it up in your expenses and your operating capacity there and thats how you ultimately make it up even in a low rate environment is just the sheer we have branches in this franchise mike in we had just to give you a sense mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc great paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp and i think mike you deepen with them you deepen with them in loans you deepen with them in wealth management and were making progress in all those areas mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator and we can move next to matthew oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i wanted to follow up on expenses you talked about billion in the fourth quarter and i just wanted to trying to figure out is that still an elevated number from covid because if you annualize it and you add the seasonal bump youre kind of call it mid billion range for next year which feels high but i wanted to give you guys a chance to address that paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah i think the billion the roughly billion for that probably includes net covid expenses of million to million matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay as you think about the timing of that billion to billion sic million to million coming off i guess it can be tricky but what are you assuming at this point paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp million to million right i mean million to million per quarter in the fourth quarter it was higher this quarter but in the fourth quarter baked into that number is million to million of net covid expenses so that will come off over and well get more of it at the end of the year than we will in the beginning of the year but it will ratably come down i would expect maybe half of that to ph being per quarter to being that on a fullyear basis matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then separately following up on net interest income you talk about it moving higher in i assume thats on a linked quarter basis and obviously theres some day count challenges in the ph first quarter but maybe just elaborate a bit on the outlook for net interest income for next year based on the assumptions that you have paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp sure look without providing any specific guidance ill give you a few thoughts on next year obviously the lower reinvestment yields are expected to continue and thats going to impact nii but that headwind early in the year should be offset by the deployment of the cash into securities and then by the middle of the year were hopeful that loan growth will be a tailwind as the economy recovers so we think nii should move forward and up from here matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so if i ph work on that math and think about again to adjust for the day count and some of those nuances would your expectation be that net interest income dollars in of next year will be higher than this year bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah to matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp id have to look at that certainly higher than yeah i would say i would expect next year to be higher than this year yes matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc all right okay that makes sense all right thank you operator and we can move next to john mcdonald with autonomous research your line is now open john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi paul two nii questions just near term so it sounds like you might be expecting a little bit of lift net of all the factors you talked about in nii in the fourth quarter or kind of flattish up a little just kind of whats the nearterm outlook on nii paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so the nearterm outlook is as i said its going to be we think at least flat and were optimistic its going to be up john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp so we think were at the low point ph for nii weve got the ones in reinvestment on securities and weve got the lower average loan balances given where were ending this quarter on loan balances but we think those headwinds are going to be offset by the deployment of the excess cash that weve done and will probably continue to do in the fourth quarter so at least flat and optimistic up john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 okay and how when you think ability redeploying cash rates are still very low today how do you balance the risk of locking in low yields and duration risk against looking to protect nii and thinking loan growth might come back you expressed some optimism there paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah its a very good question we are always balancing liquidity capital and earnings i dont want to go into a lot of detail but we are maintaining the asset sensitivity of the company with these purchases john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then one nitpick here in the other income category theres a net loss in noninterest income of minus million so you mentioned tax advantaged investments and other things is that kind of what we should expect going forward and youre getting the benefit in the tax rate but this other income kind of runs at a little bit of a loss or are there some other issues there paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah no i think i would expect that i think other incomes going to bounce around quarter to quarter but it should on average be down a couple hundred million given as you said the investment in our renewable energy products and other esg efforts which create partnership losses john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay okay so thats kind of a new run rate ph first half paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp and remember in the fourth quarter those partnership losses are always higher so think maybe a couple hundred million higher john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay more than the million this quarter paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah but we get the benefit in the tax line throughout the year john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yeah for the fourth quarter and do you have an idea of like tax rate for an annual basis going forward with this new arrangement bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp i dont have an expectation for next year to share with you but the fourth quarter absent some unusual items john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thank you paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp and i would just remind everybody that these tax advantaged investments are things were doing to help society were talking about low income housing were talking about wind and solar these are things that are part of our esg effort brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah were a melioristic company but on the other hand were also doing it because its a good business for us and helps us generate the benefits net of the cost of losses are positive to the companys earnings john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it thanks operator and we can move next to ken usdin with jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning guys i was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on just your expectations for just how the loss cycle is going to evolve paul i believe you mentioned that you wouldnt expect losses to really start moving up until midyear next year and ph i know as we start to evaluate whether or not and how much stimulus we get versus what weve already gotten baked in the cake just how are you expecting to see both the consumer and the commercial side traject as we move forward thanks paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah sure so look regarding net chargeoffs i think weve covered it but in consumer given the lack of significant delinquencies weve seen so far even on those customers who have come off deferral and given the fact that net chargeoffs dont occur without bankruptcy until days past due its just not likely were going to see consumer net chargeoffs would show up until kind of mid2021 brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah if you go back and think about it what we thought was going to happen third quarter this year pushed out going back to the first quarter when we looked at it and the second quarter we looked at we pushed out further bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 the third quarter we pushed out further so it keeps pushing out based on frankly the characteristics of our consumers are stronger than the characteristics generally in the united states and the characteristics of the united states are theyre consumers are doing better because of all the things you mentioned than the unemployment statistic would indicate in models and so it just pushed it out but its now to the second half of next year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah and i guess im just trying to wonder brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp indiscernible ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc sorry go ahead brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp remember the nearterm path of chargeoffs is going to be driven by delinquency roll and things like that whats delinquent at the end of this quarter and as paul said the 30day delinquencies are down yearoveryear and mortgages and cards and things like that its down as a percent and down as a dollar amount and down as a percent on a smaller balance so the credit qualitys been strong ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah and you made the point about not being quite clear yet on if you should release reserves just given the uncertainties i guess how much is future stimulus a part of that equation what do you look for to kind get that comfort zone that you can say i know you said the builds are done but just in terms of starting to utilize and feel comfortable that you can let even more of those reserves kind of flow back into capital brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp so a stimulus plan would help the unemployed the businesses are still struggling to get their business capacity get their business utilization up those obvious businesses you all know and ph in states and towns so they dont have further reduction in budgets andor schools and other things hospitals all these people have been heavily affected stimulus affecting those would help all these speed up the pace of the ph investments coming down quite frankly right now there right now thats not baked in as paul said earlier but stimulus coming in would move us further and youd see the reserves come out further because of the lifetime expectation of losses would be lower its kind of the way it works ph for losses ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc all right thanks very much bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 operator and we will move next to charles peabody with portales your line is open charles peabody q president portales partners llc yeah two quick questions in your guidance on no more reserve build im trying to make sure i understand that because youve also talked about the possibility of loan growth so at the very least youll cover chargeoffs but we also provide for loan growth brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp we would but just think about a couple percentage of loan growth given the level of reserving wouldnt change it dramatically so if we had fast loan growth which i dont think the economy is going to support in the near term wed have to grow it faster but that would be a highquality problem to have to build reserves for loan growth charles peabody q president portales partners llc sure sure and then the second question is can you give some color on the pipeline for investment banking and what that looks like versus the second quarter or the yearago fourth quarter paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah the pipeline looks solid for investment banking again the second quarter was a record quarter for us and the third quarter was the secondbest quarter for us so and investment bankings normally down sequentially third quarter to fourth quarter i dont think you can expect to see the same type of volume in the fourth quarter that we saw in the second quarter or perhaps the third quarter but the pipeline looks solid and were even seeing some ma pick up or at least from a discussion standpoint brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp and tom montag and i have been very pleased with the work that matthew koders done with that team over the last yearandahalf or so since he took over and just driving great coverage driving great connectivity to our middle market business and the fees there are continuing to grow and so theyve done a hes done a very good job with the management team in that business and wed expect him to keep making progress paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah weve gone from just in middle market alone weve gone from fourth to second in a year with market share we talked about market share gains earlier charles peabody q president portales partners llc okay thank you operator and this does conclude the questionandanswer session id like to turn the program over to brian moynihan for any closing remarks bank of america corp bac corrected
