thanks brian t moynihan chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp thank you lee and good morning to all of you and thank you for joining us i am starting on slide of the earnings presentation we once begin delivered a strong set of results in quarter one we reported net income of billion after tax and eps of this included the additional expense accrual for the industry special assessment by the fdic to recover losses from the failures of silicon valley bank and signature bank this lowered our quarter one eps by including that expense net income was billion and eps was per share in quarter one alastair is going to walk you through the details of the quarter momentarily but first let me give you a few thoughts on our performance we delivered good improvement in our feebased business driven both by continued organic growth and good market conditions investment banking saw nice rebound this quarter we delivered nearly billion in investment banking fees and grew from the first quarter matthew koder and the team have done a great job delivering market share growth in addition our results reflect the benefits of investments made in our middlemarket investment banking teams and dualcoverage teams matthew has utilized his power wisely to grow our middle market team from bankers in across a dozen cities to more than bankers in twice as many cities today both groups work with our commercial bankers and wealth management advisors in those cities to deliver for our clients investment and brokerage services revenue across merrill and the private bank grew year over year in quarter one to nearly billion continued investments in our advisor training programs and digital delivery for our clients as well as positive market helped us deliver strong revenue asset under management flows were billion in the quarter sales and trading excluding dva delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of yearoveryear revenue improvement at billion this was the highest first quarter result in over a decade we have allocated more balance sheet invested in talent to build on our strengths over the last five years in this business those investments plus the intensity of the teams under jimmy demares leadership has resulted in good momentum and market share improvement from a balance sheet perspective we entered the quarter expecting modest moves in loan growth and a decline in deposits those were our expectations what we actually delivered was growth in ending deposits of more than billion ending loans were down modestly due to the expected credit card seasonality otherwise loans were pretty stable this balance sheet performance along with our continued pricing discipline allowed us to deliver better than expected nii performance we told you last quarter that we expected nii to decline from the fourth quarter of to the first quarter of a decline of about million to million we actually reported today nii of billion that was million higher than quarter four exceeding our guidance bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 we continue to deliver strong expense management yearoveryear expenses adjusted for the fdic assessment was up a little less than that compares to a 4plus inflation rate we also continue to invest in our company while managing those expenses we had several categories of stronger feebased revenue in the first quarter this year this drove higher formulaic compensation and processing costs of the increased activity fees and commissions were up year over year were happy to pay for that revenue and deliver more earnings to the bottom line because of it so how did we do all that and hold expenses under the inflation rate well we remain focused on three primary drivers at bank of america first our operational excellence platform continues to deliver and improve processes these savings from that growth help fund the future growth in the company and lower the risk second we managed head count as we eliminated work recall we noted an expectation in january of last year that our head count will be down throughout the year our head count at the end of first quarter is down by more than people from the first quarter of it declined people just from the end of the digitization activity is also driving ongoing expense cost savings customer retention and market share improvement driving across all three factors it also then supports the everincreasing volumes of client activity with little increased cost i would highlight our continued capital strength with common equity tier capital of billion that amount of capital is billion over the current regulatory minimums for our company that capital has allowed us to both support our clients and return billion to shareholders this quarter in share repurchases and dividends let me highlight a few points on organic growth before i pass over to alastair now im turning to slide you can see slide the highlights of the quarter one successful organic activity across the businesses we continue to invest to enhance our digital platforms we provide our customers with convenient and secure banking experiences by leveraging our technology and continuous investment in that technology and putting customers at the center of everything we do we have successfully deepened our relationships and expanded our customer base across all our businesses in consumer we added net new checking accounts this quarter this completes straight quarters of net additions dean athanasia aron levine and holly oneill helped drive that business for us and continue to perform well driving strong performance across our consumer franchise these checking balances continue to drive the performance of our consumer deposits these checking additions are important for many other reasons on average of our deposit balances have been with us for more than years of the customer checking accounts are primary checking accounts and household meaning that theyre the core operating account for the household for their financial lives so when we onboard a client we start a longterm valuable relationship about of our checking accounts customers use a debit card and on average they do about transactions per year on that card the new checking accounts have traditionally opened savings accounts about of the time within a few months of opening that checking account that opening a new checking account on average brings about in balances below our averages but that continues to grow and within a year its two times that amount likewise when we open a new savings account it on average brings about in balances this also indiscernible about two times during the year bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 investment relationships and credit card account openings continue to be strong in the first quarter as well and while we believe some of these statistics are bestinclass rest assured there are plenty of opportunities for further growth in our franchise and our company as we think about our global wealth team led by eric schimpf lindsay hans and katy knox that team added net new wealth relationships to merrill and the private bank our advisors opened new bank accounts in the quarter with our customers deepening their relationships more than of our investing clients in merrill and of our private banking clients now have a core banking relationship with us in addition across our wealth spectrum we saw billion in total flows over the last year as you can see on the slide we now manage more than trillion in total client balances across loans deposits and investments in consumer and wealth management when we move to global banking we added more new relationships in this quarter than we did in last years first quarter we also increased the number of solutions per relationship with preexisting clients just like in our consumer business we have seen good growth in customers seeking the benefits of both our physical and our online capabilities and also the care of our talented relationship managers who provide financing solutions and advice for our clients with global needs a couple other points id make on our digital success erica our virtual banking assistant reached a key milestone of more than billion interactions since its introduction about six years ago it took four years to reach billion interactions it took just months to reach the second billion in august we extended ericas reach and launched erica in our global treasury services business and cashpro erica has resolved of the cashpro chat inquiries automatedly demonstrating more and more clients are able to selfsolve this is a great example of best practices being shared across the scale of our company second as an example of our digital success zelle continues to grow it wasnt long ago that we noted that the number of zelle transactions in a quarter had surpassed the numbers of checks written shortly after that zelle transactions reached two times the number of checks written this quarter zelle transactions has now passed the combined number of checks written plus the amount of cash withdrawals from tellers and from atms that is a rapid adoption and represents continued cost savings and convenience and security for the customers these stats and others are included in our quarterly indiscernible for our digital banking progress thats included in slides and i encourage you to read them they show our marketleading efforts representing billions of dollars of our investment over the years and we are continuing to drive growth with expense growth under control this solid earnings results achieved this quarter are a testament to the dedication and talent of our people who work here and deliver for our customers every day i thank them for another great quarter and with that ill turn it over to alastair alastair borthwick chief financial officer bank of america corp thank you brian and im going to start on slide of the earnings presentation so brian covered much of the income statement highlights and he noted the difference in our reported results and the results adjusted for the fdic assessment so im not going to repeat that id just add that we delivered strong returns on a reported basis our return on average assets was basis points and return on tangible common equity was and bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 when adjusted for the fdic assessment our efficiency ratio was roa at basis points and rotce at so lets move to the balance sheet on slide where we ended the quarter at trillion of total assets up billion from the fourth quarter and the bulk of that increase was in global markets to support seasonally elevated levels of client activity outside of the global markets activity wed highlight both the billion growth in deposits and the billion decline in cash levels so with that increase in liquidity youll also note that debt securities increased billion which included an billion decline in holdtomaturity securities and a billion increase in afs securities and those are mostly hedged us treasuries added with yields effectively at cash rates at billion our absolute cash levels remain higher than required liquidity remains strong with billion of global liquidity sources and thats up billion from the fourth quarter and remains billion above our pre pandemic fourth quarter level shareholders equity increased billion from the fourth quarter earnings as they were only partially offset by capital distributed to shareholders and aoci was little changed in the quarter during the quarter we paid out billion in common dividends and we bought back billion in shares which more than offset our employee awards as part of our those share awards in the first quarter we announced our seventh consecutive year of sharing success compensation awards covering more than of our associates and further aligning their interests with shareholders tangible book value per share of is up yearover year looking at regulatory capital our cet1 level improved to billion from december and the cet1 ratio was stable at and remained well above our current requirement we also remain quite well positioned against the current proposed capital rules as our cet1 level is also above the requirement even when we include estimated rwa inflation from those new proposed rules riskweighted assets increased modestly driven by client activity in global markets and our supplemental leverage ratio was compared to a minimum requirement of which leaves capacity for balance sheet growth and at billion of total lossabsorbing capital our tlac ratio remains comfortably above our requirements lets turn our balance sheet focus to loans by looking at the average balances on slide average loans in the first quarter of trillion were flat compared to the fourth quarter and they improved yearoveryear as solid credit card growth was partially offset by declines in securitiesbased lending commercial loans grew modestly yearoveryear we experienced modest improvement in revolver utilization and commercial lending in the first quarter and thats being offset for the most part by paydowns as larger client financing solutions are being met through capital markets access and lastly on a positive note loan spreads continued to widen moving to deposits well stay focused on averages on slide and relative to prepandemic  average deposits are still up every line of business remains well above their prepandemic levels and consumer is up with checking up driven by net new checking accounts added as brian noted earlier linked quarter total average deposits remain steady at more than trillion bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 the total rate paid on consumer deposits in the quarter was basis points and while the rate increased basis points from the fourth quarter the pace of increases continues to slow the mix of lowrate and highquality transactional accounts keeps the rate paid low wealth management and global banking also saw a slowdown in the increases in their rate paid and slowdown in the rotation out of noninterestbearing accounts in the first quarter focusing for a moment on ending deposits and movement from the fourth quarter this quarter we delivered good deposit growth total deposits grew billion and theyre now billion above their trough in midmay of consumer banking deposits saw growth in both consumer interest bearing and noninterest bearing global banking continued their more normal pattern of deposits seen for the past five quarters and up more than billion over the last year deposit growth exceeded loan growth for the third straight quarter and our excess of deposits over loans expanded to billion and thats nearly two times the billion we had prepandemic you can see that on the upper lefthand side of slide we continue to have a mix of cash availableforsale securities and heldtomaturity securities and this quarter our combination of cash and afs is now of the total trillion noted on this page youll also notice the continued change in mix of the shorterterm portfolio as we again lower cash and increase afs securities that are mostly hedged and have similar yields to the cash note also the holdtomaturity book continues to decline from paydowns in total the holdtomaturity book is now down billion from its peak and it consists of about billion in treasuries and about billion in mortgagebacked securities along with billion of other securities lastly the blended cash and securities yield of basis points continued to rise and remained about basis points above the rate we pay for deposits the replacement of lowerearning assets into higheryielding assets continues to provide an ongoing benefit to nii lets turn our focus to nii performance using slide where you can see on a fully tax equivalent basis nii was billion good deposit growth provided a strong start to the year for nii and as brian noted nii of billion increased by million from the fourth quarter now that compares to our expectation and guidance of a decline of million to million and that would have resulted in nii this quarter of billion or billion so we did quite a bit better than we had originally expected the improvement in quarterly nii in  compared to  included the benefits of higheryielding assets and improvement in global markets nii partially offset by higher deposit costs and one less day in  than  deposit balance activity more generally also aided in the beat versus our expectations as we look forward for  we expect some modest impact of lower deposits in wealth management as clients make their seasonal income tax payments and we expect global markets nii to decline mostly seasonally a little bit as well so we expect second quarter nii could approach billion on an fte basis and further we continue to expect that  will be the low point for nii and we expect the back half of to grow and compared to our guidance last quarter were obviously growing off a larger base of nii after having outperformed in the first quarter bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 with regard to that forward view let me just note a few other caveats it includes our assumption that interest rates in the forward curve at the end of the quarter materialize and at the end of the first quarter there were still three cuts expected this year starting in june our forward view also includes an expectation of lowsingledigit loan growth and some moderate growth in deposits as we move into the back half of and given our recent deposit and loan performance we continue to feel good about these assumptions turning to asset sensitivity and focused on a forwardyieldcurve basis our sensitivity to the plus and minus basispoint parallel shifts in the forward curve at march remains well balanced okay lets turn to expense and well use slide for that discussion where we reported billion expense this quarter including the fdic assessment adjusted for the assessment expenses were billion and the increase over the fourth quarter included a little more than million in seasonal payroll tax expense as well as higher revenuerelated costs and to a lesser expense annual merit increases and other annual awards like sharing success awards provided this quarter billion was just a little above our forecast for  which we made last quarter and the increase is driven by betterthanexpected fee revenue across wealth management investment banking and sales and trading and as brian said thats a tradeoff were more than happy to make bringing more earnings to the bottom line and while expense is up almost from last year we simply remind you inflation is up by more than and weve increased our investment and were paying for the revenue growth so we think it represents good work by our teams as we look forward in  we expect a decline from the  level as we typically see about twothirds of the  elevated payroll tax expense come back out and the remainder of the year expense is expected to trend down continued digital engagement savings and operational excellence initiatives should help us offset other cost increases for people and technology through the back half of the year turning to credit on slide provision expense was billion in the first quarter and that included million of reserve release due to a modestly improved macro environmental outlook as the baseline consensus expectations improved from the fourth quarter on a weighted basis we remain reserved for an unemployment rate of nearly by the end of compared to the most recent actual rate net chargeoffs of billion increased million from the fourth quarter driven by continued credit card seasoning and commercial real estate office exposures as swift revaluations from current appraisals and resolutions drove higher chargeoffs the net chargeoff ratio was basis points a 13basispoint increase from the fourth quarter on slide we show you the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios consumer net chargeoffs increased million versus the fourth quarter from the flow through of higher latestage credit card delinquencies we included a creditcarddelinquency slide number in our appendix and were encouraged by the trend of delinquencies because the latestage increases slowed and earlystage delinquencies improved as well and that leads us to believe we should begin to see consumer net chargeoffs start to level out over the next quarter or so all of this is still well within our risk appetite and our expectations and its consistent with the normalization of credit weve discussed with you in prior calls commercial net chargeoffs increased million versus the fourth quarter driven by commercial real estate losses and office exposures and on office losses this quarter we recorded chargeoffs on office loans were a result of sales activity ie final resolution were from losses that we expect on exposures that are in the bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 process of expected resolution in the course of the next days and the rest we took as a result of refreshed valuations were using a continuous and thorough loanbyloan analysis and were quick to recognize impacts in the commercial real estate office space through our risk ratings and thats resulted in several downgrades in the last few quarters as a result of these quick actions and our downgrades in categorization weve also refreshed the valuation of our reservable criticized properties and weve taken appropriate reserves and chargeoffs in the process roughly onethird of our office exposure is now categorized as reservable criticized and importantly the pace of the increase in reservablecriticized exposures has slowed each quarter since the second quarter of last year so we believe the losses on these office properties have been front loaded and largely reserved we expect the losses to move lower in the second quarter and we expect a notable decline in the second half of the year when compared to the first half of this year absent any material change in expected real estate prices in the appendix on slide weve included a current view of our commercial real estate and office portfolio metrics as we usually do okay lets turn to the various lines of business and offer some brief comments on their results starting on slide with consumer banking for the quarter consumer banking earned billion on continued strong organic growth the reported earnings declined year over year as revenue declined from lower deposit balances compared to the first quarter of credit card loss normalization also caused yearoveryear provision expense to increase as brian noted customer activity showed another strong quarter of net new checking growth another strong period of card openings and investment balances for consumer clients which climbed year over year to a record billion that included market appreciation and also very strong fullyear flows of billion as noted earlier loans grew nicely year over year from credit card as well as small business where we remain the industry leader expenses were flat yearoveryear fighting off inflation merit increases higher minimum wages and new and renovated financial centers and technology investments so holding expense flat reflected very good work by the consumer team as you can see on the appendix page digital adoption and engagement continued to improve reaching a record of billion digital logins in the quarter and it showed good yearoveryear improvement customer satisfaction scores at near record levels illustrate the continued appreciation of the enhanced capabilities we provide moving to wealth management on slide we produced good results and that included good organic client activity market favorability and strong flows our comprehensive suite of investment and advisory services coupled with a commitment to personalized wealth management planning and solutions has enabled us to meet the diverse needs and aspirations of our clients in first quarter we reported record revenue of billion and a little more than billion in net income that net income was from the first quarter of business generated positive operating leverage and grew revenue faster than expense while improving the pretax margin year over year while overall average loans were down year over year driven by the securitiesbased lending its worth noting the strong growth were seeing in custom lending and ending loans in the wealth management custom loan book are up year over year bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 as brian noted earlier both merrill and the private bank continue to see strong organic growth and produce good assets under management flows of more than billion since the first quarter of which reflects a good mix of new client money as well as existing clients putting money to work expense growth here matched the revenue growth otherwise fighting off higher investment cost and inflation let me also highlight the continued digital momentum here as an example merrill has of its clients now engaging with us digitally and utilizing edelivery of their eligible accounts are now opened digitally so the cost for us to open is half and the customer cycle times are improved greatly on slide you see global banking results and the business produced earnings of just less than billion down year over year as improved investment banking fees and treasury services revenue were overcome by lower net interest income and higher provision expense revenue declined driven by the impact of interest rates and deposit rotation to interest bearing and that impacted nii the diversification of our revenue across products and regions continues to reflect the strength of this platform and gts and investment banking fees are good examples in our global treasury services business some of the nii pressure from higher rates on deposits is offset by the fees paid for moving and managing the cash of clients and that continues to grow with existing clients as well as with new client generation as brian noted investment banking had a strong quarter and at billion in investment banking fees this quarter was the strongest quarter in seven years absent the pandemic and periods an increase in provision expense included the commercial real estate net chargeoffs i discussed earlier as well as a larger reserve release in the prioryear period expense increased year over year including the lift in investment banking fees in the first quarter of switching to global markets on slide well focus our comments on results excluding dva as we normally do team had another terrific quarter with billion in earnings growing year over year revenue improved from the first quarter of and return on average allocated capital was focusing on sales and trading exdva revenue improved year over year to billion which is the highest first quarter result in over a decade ficc was down while equities increased compared to the first quarter of and the decline in the ficc revenues versus the first quarter was driven by a weaker macro trading quarter that was partially offset by better mortgage trading results equities was driven by strong trading results in derivatives and yearoveryear expenses were up on continued investment in the business finally and on slide all other shows a loss of million driven by the fdic assessment revenue declined year over year reflecting higher investment tax credit deals and expense adjusted for the fdic assessment was down million driven by lower unemployment processing costs our effective tax rate for the quarter was and excluding the fdic assessment and other discrete items it would have been and further excluding tax credits related to investments and renewable energy and affordable housing our effective tax rate would have been thank you and with that well jump into qa bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question from steven chubak of wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp morning steven steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so maybe just to start off with a question on capital management just given the strength of your excess capital position but admittedly still some uncertainty around basel iii endgame and where the proposal could ultimately shake out was hoping you could just speak to where youre comfortable running on cet1 and when can we expect that youll return to 100plus type payout brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp i think you should expect that were on a cushion whatever rules come out and when they come out and get clarity well expect to run the requirements plus basis points up to basis points of excess and anything above that will be either used to continue to grow the company if needed if not it will be returned and so were just as all of us are waiting for the finalization of these rules right now were sitting on billion under the old rules we have enough under the new rules as previously proposed but obviously theyre talking about changing them so you should expect clarity on that what youd also expect is as we think about it beginning now youre basically at the point where youre sitting on the capital with a very modest need to build a cushion to the rules thats proposed and any changes will be more favorable to that i assume so expect us to continue to return capital at a fairly strong rate as we move through the second quarter and beyond and the rules become clarified steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc great color brian and for my followup just on the nii commentary alastair it sounds like youre still assuming some modest deposit growth in the back half as part of that nii trajectory that recovery off the trough in just given your deposit balances increased billion since covid i know some of that is going to be a function of share gains but as we prepare for some qtdriven outflows how are you handicapping the risk of deposit attrition and how does that impact the nii guidance if you can frame any sort of sensitivity recognizing many of those tend to be hot money or highercost deposits alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 yeah so first thing ill just say steven as weve been up against qt now for the last couple of years so the deposits are beginning to settle in now and if we were to go back to if you take for example consumer if you were to go back to prepandemic and think about what longterm sustainable growth rates look like for consumer if you just extended that through from the fourth quarter of to today given that the economy is larger we kind of feel like consumer is approaching that floor so were still in this belief that  is going to be  maybe the turning point for consumer you can see that slowing now the rest of our business if you look at the exhibit we put together on deposits if you look at that bottom left chart on wealth youll see it slowed and grew this quarter and then in global banking on the righthand side of that page theyre kind of back to prepandemic growth rates theyre up year over year so were seeing some structure now in the deposit base even with qt over the course of the past year our deposits were up billion so it has been a point of conviction of ours that as we get towards  we should see the consumer side begin to stabilize thats whats driving our conviction that nii will go up in  and  were in that transition period right now steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc great color thanks so much for taking my questions operator well take our next question from mike mayo of wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi well thanks for the outlook for nii and the consumer chargeoffs but once again i go back to efficiency and you highlight the billion erica interactions the last billion in the last months you mentioned zelle transactions now double the check transactions or more than checks plus cash withdrawals from atms plus cash withdrawals from tellers so for all the great tech work the efficiency ratio improved to quarterover quarter but i know youre still not happy with that so as you see the nii decline in sight and as you have this tech evolutions continuing when do you think you can get below a efficiency ratio whats your outlook for that because im just reconciling the numbers that we look at with all the progress youre making internally thanks brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah mike i think as nii sort of moves along the path alastair mentioned all that sort of flows through because theres no more activity attached to this as youre pointing out and we continue to reduce marginal expense of that activity because largely thats a consumer and wealth management and global banking which dont add lots more clients and stuff and lots more activity even though the numbers go up its out of efficiency so that continue to improve our efficiency ratio as you also well know when the revenue growth is coming through the wealth management business which by definition because of the way the compensation process works has a lowest efficiency ratio in the company thats a good thing because it grows and we get good profitability growth out of it but it were fighting that trend and as one of the largest wealth management businesses in the world if not its a higher percentage of our revenues and our expense base and so were continuing to drive it down were at youd expect that to improve as the deposit balances stabilized and for many quarters now and starting to grow bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 the rate paid is really flattened out sequentially by quarter and the yield of the portfolio and the yield of the assets continues to grow so we feel good about how its going our focus is really on deploying expenses in operating leverage and as we get through the twist in the nii you should start to see us return to that again and that will then obviously drive down the efficiency ratio mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so what are you thinking about expense growth for the rest of the year or next year for a while there youre trying and i get it inflation has gone up quite a bit but what are your thoughts about expense growth looking ahead alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well last year remember mike we told you we thought we could drive expense down every quarter we believe this year the expense will trend down over the course of this year and obviously  is inflated a little bit with just payroll tax and some of the revenue seasonality but underneath that theres pretty significant revenue strength so i think that probably cost us million or so this quarter i think we probably are looking if this environment continues were looking at another million per quarter going forward but to brians point its the good expense that comes with revenue growth over time thats really the only change id say with respect to how we think about the expense picture mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator well take our next question from john mcdonald of autonomous research john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp thanks good morning wanted to follow up on the helpful deposit commentary alastair so you mentioned the consumer youre thinking that thatll stabilize in the back half of the year on deposits wondering what your mix shift expectations are earlier this year you kind of thought that those customers that had moved for rate seeking already had im just wondering if higher rates for longer could put some pressure on rateseeking behavior again and what youre baking in in terms of mix shift from noninterest bearing to interest bearing in your outlook and your planning brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah john i think if you look at you could see sort of the mix in the lefthand corner remember that one of the things people have to we all have to be careful about is in the global banking area the way the fees are paid and earnings credit messes up the simplicity of noninterest bearing and interest bearing so its complex but if you look at the quarters coming across from the first quarter through the first quarter you can see that youre seeing that the rate of change slow dramatically and kind of settle in so i dont a lot of the money has moved bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 if you look at the sevenday average for consumer going all the way back to the early part of october its been relatively stable at billion billion so were just getting through the tax seasons and the ins and outs in the wealth management business consumer people paying taxes out on the wealthier side and receiving benefits on the tax refund side so as we stabilize in that we expect it to grow we dont expect a massive change in how the deposits are structured from whats in money markets whats in savings whats in checking whats in ph that its really slowed down and been relatively stable so things bump around but its all very good value even the highestpaid balances in the wealth management business are good value for the company but if you look at what really drives the value its the 950odd billion dollars in the checking balances you can see on page the core checking balances thats what drives it john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp so youre still feeling brian like the bulk of people that have kind of moved on rateseeking behavior likely have done so brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah if you look on the consumer business and you think about tracking those deposits accounts from pre pandemic to now which is one thing weve talked about for different purposes but if you look at where all the deposit balance is if people with loweraverage balances are still multiples of where they were prepandemic people with higher balances were actually lower because obviously they were sitting on cash when in the pandemic and accumulated more cash and when rates came up they moved it and all in that gives you what you see in consumer which is at the end of the day couple hundred billion dollars over where it was pre pandemic but the people have moved and youre seeing it monthtomonth relatively stable as we track that every month on both sides frankly the loweraverage balance accounts from prepandemic are basically bouncing around at the same level right now not going down not going up and the higher ones are stable but they are down for people with and million balances largely because they moved it in the market so we feel stabilized and therell be ins and outs and well see it play out but its extremely valuable no matter how you look at it john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp okay and maybe as a quick followup for alastair its nice to see the core nim the net interest yield exmarkets inflect positively this quarter is that sustainable do you feel like and what are some of the fixed asset reprice dynamics that are tailwinds beyond the billion per quarter on securities in terms of like loans and swaps thatll come due over the next year or two and help the nim a bit could you talk a little bit about that alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp sure weve talked about the fact that the net interest yield obviously this quarter benefits from the nii growth so youre getting in the numerator but we inflated the denominator in terms of the average earning assets last year as we just made the balance sheet more liquid so thats going to allow us to continue as the deposits grow to grow the net interest income over time without necessarily growing the other earning assets so  will have a bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 little more of a challenge but going forward i expect all the nii improvement in  and  to drop into that net interest yield and part of the things supporting that john as you pointed out is we do have loans repricing because weve got loans coming off the balance sheet and were booking new loans at higher rates so thats one element second element is weve got securities that were reinvesting underneath all this too so obviously were sweeping the holdtomaturity paydowns and reinvesting those at much higher rates and then third the teams have been working hard at repricing the balance sheet broadly for things like loans and i believe weve now had seven quarters in a row of improving loan pricing so weve just got to keep grinding away at that john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp got it thank you operator well take our next question from betsy graseck of morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so thanks very much for taking the question and i guess just wanted to follow up on the conversation you were just having and alastair i know that look your nii guide improved this quarter due to results being better than what you anticipated a quarter ago my question is on the second half improvement i guess it is going to be an improvement from first half right thats basically the base that youre looking at im wondering how youre thinking about the nii trajectory on a year audio gap i believe nii is down about year on year in should we anticipate that that is kind of stable pace throughout the year or that reduces as well when were talking about second half if you could just give us a sense of year on year that would be helpful thanks brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp betsy before alastair answers your question its good to have you back and we wish you good luck with everything so alastair why dont you hit that betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc oh thanks so much brian really appreciate that alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 its good to have you so i guess a couple things the first thing is we havent changed our perspective in terms of this idea of  being the low point and the trough for the year we havent changed our point of view on growing in terms of  and  betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp i think the important thing were trying to convey is because of the continued stability in pricing rotation and because of this continued stability in deposits we feel like that extra couple hundred million in  is something that should flow through in   and  and then therell be a second dynamic to watch for as well betsy which is if we have less rate cuts were going to benefit from them we wont necessarily benefit a lot in  because there isnt enough cuts or time in  but i think by the time we get to  and  well know more about the rate structure at that point and well be able to tell you more about how what we expect for the growth in the back half of the year but were reasonably optimistic there betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc super thats perfect thank you and then just one followup is on the aoci so we all know the htm is a portfolio that youre in runoff on i guess if thats fair to say is the balances are pulling off brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yes betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and this quarter we did have a backup in the long end of the curve your aoci really didnt flex that much and part of my question is is that a function of how the securities book is comprised and youve been shifting towards treasuries and thats reducing this risk as the back end of the curve increases so i just wanted to understand how thats trajecting in your mind because it is a concern that people raise and what i saw today suggests that its much less of a concern than it had been a year ago say for example would you agree with that or yeah alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah yes i mean weve deliberately worked on that over time but weve always i think had a pretty good program of hedging the fixed rate securities in the fs book so that theyre swapped and that means that if rates go up we obviously benefit from that it doesnt necessarily hurt us in terms of aoci so most or all of the treasuries that you see in our portfolio are swapped so i would expect very little in the way of aoci impact there bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks so much operator well take our next question from glenn schorr of evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi perfect lead into this question on slide you talk about afs securities mostly hedged with floating rate swaps and the duration of less than a half a year i know the feds forward curve keeps not being correct but at some point its going to be correct and the rates are going to come in my question is what do you do about that how much do you think about extending durations and managing your swaps a little differently as we eventually indiscernible at this time transition to a different rate backdrop alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so glenn i mean ultimately well use the same philosophy and strategy that we do to this point we are in obviously a very good position where we have substantial deposits in excess of loans thats what creates this excess in the top left of page and its what allows us to put everything to work in the top right the balance that we try to strike you can sort of see in the lefthand side were trying to make sure that that cash and securities yield compared to the deposit rate paid performs in any environment so in an environment like this one where theres an awful lot going on with rates we feel like if you look at that spread i think it was basis point different quarter over quarter so were trying to make sure that we lock in the value monetize the deposits regardless of whatever rate environment turns out to be and we feel like were pretty balanced now weve got a pretty good balance of shortdated longdated fixed and floating that should allow us to perform whether rates go up or down from here one final thing ill just say and i think you know this glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi indiscernible alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp underneath all of this obviously weve got some securities repricing and to the point i think it was john asked earlier weve got the loans repricing as well and all of that gives a little bit of underlying resilience to this glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi yes i get that i guess you had a lot of flexibility should you decide ph its time just one followup you talked deposits to debt you had a smidgeon of yearonyear loan growth mostly in cards i think but it seems i know how we got here but were in an environment we see as really strong economy and up markets and yet no loan growth bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yes glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi is this just any way you slice it we have to go through another year or two of super low loan growth or are there any leading indicators that would lead you to believe you can get back to a little bit more normal bofa loan growth and not have to wait two years for it alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah well i think were probably getting closer now because remember in a big macro were in that transition period where postpandemic the economy is sort of recovering and rates are settling in and its changing peoples behavior so weve actually got pretty good credit card growth and thats just offset by the fact that for example with securitiesbased lending at rates that are higher people are doing less of it or in commercial weve got some loan growth but the revolver utilization is still suppressed because revolver costs a lot more so as the fed has raised rates its changed some of the borrowing patterns of our clients but thats not going to last forever because as you point out the economy powers through at whatever it ends up being loan growth is going to catch up to that over time so for right now were in that transition period but were anticipating that loan growth will pick up at some point in the future but its not an enormous part of our nii guide at this point brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp and just remember that the capital markets opened up and a lot of the larger clients accessed them as they frankly have gotten used to the higher rate structure and need to refinance so that if you look across the businesses youve got the commercial run but if you look across commercial businesses in the middle market and business banking the segment up to million in revenue companies and up to billion they actually saw progress in loan growth it was really in the highend global corporate investment banking business where you saw sort of paydowns and bring that down that phenomenon is one that occurs from time to time its probably stabilized now well see it play out but we are fighting for loan growth and frankly line usage stabilized and is better than its been for last few quarters in terms of trend and so again that all speaks to people feeling fine but theyre not quite as aggressive as they would be when you read the economic statistics and thats one of the great debates that you can read about in the paper every day glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thank you both for all that operator well take our next question from matt oconnor of deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 good morning so obviously theres been a lot of questions on net interest income and a lot of good color i guess just when you put it all together like when you think about the higherforlonger environment obviously its good on the reinvestments youre trying to match the deposits like you talked about but how would you just boil it down your rate disclosures still show billion kind of exposure to either side if stable rates for a couple years is that good or does that accelerate the deposit repricing or just boil that down thanks alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp sure well id say generally speaking higher for longer is probably better for banks as a general statement the question will become why are rates higher like whats going on in the economy are we talking about inflation is it under control is it coming down right now that appears to be the case so thats obviously a good place and the fed is in a good place because they appear to have rates real rate thats high enough to make sure that inflation stays in a good place things can change matt so an awful lot will depend upon just the why for rates but generally speaking if its just because its taking a little while longer for the inflation to nudge down before the next set of cuts thats probably a good environment for us i would expect us to perform relatively better than weve disclosed so far and then youre asking a second question which is around the what does the sensitivity look like to plus basis points or minus basis points weve tried to just make sure that we continue to stay balanced if anything that corridor of plus basis pointsminus basis points has gotten narrower and narrower over time as were trying to lock in nii thats billion billion higher per quarter today than it was three years ago and just make sure that the shareholder benefits from that through the course of time so well need to see how the environment plays out its only been a quarter since we were last here talking about six cuts now its three so we just have to watch this play out and stay patient matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay fair enough thats helpful thank you operator well take our next question from ken usdin of jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks very much good morning a real breakout quarter for the ib fee line and just wondering a couple things within that one there was a bit of a back and forth from some of the other banks about whether or not dcm was pulled forward a little bit from future i wonder what you think about that and but more broadly just you guys have done a good job taking share what inning do you think you are in terms of not so much just green shoots but in terms of where that incremental productivity is in terms of getting that ib line to a more permanent higher level thanks brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp so i think about it if you back in sort of the period prior to the runup in the couple years after the pandemic you had sort of mid billionish type of numbers a quarter we think were fundamentally stronger in a market position as you said so we feel very good about the work matthew and the team have done and as we look at it we believe that theyll continue to gain share and i think this is a more normalized level and whether its pulled bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 forward or not well find out but its a more normalized level given those dynamics and one we should be able to build off of especially as i said earlier the penetration in the middlemarket side of our business and whether those clients working off our wealth management in the markets generally plus working across the globe and weve done better work international so we feel good everything the team has done the combination of corporate and investment banking is very strong so we dont think this is like an unusually high watermark and we should be able to build from here ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and then one question about wealth management and just client choices in terms of where theyre sitting relative to earning nii or earning fees where do you sense that the kind of cash versus fully invested is in terms of the wealth management brokerage business and could that turn to the better turn to the worse depending on how that mix answer goes thanks alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well wealth management i think lindsay katy and eric highlight for us regularly just the elevated levels of cash that our clients have a lot of that is on us and you can see that on our deposit chart but theres a lot that we captured in the investment area too where a lot of their flows are coming into maybe its money market funds maybe the shortdated treasuries but theres a lot of cash at this point so that would tell you its supporting the ability to see continued assets under management flows going forward depending on how the obviously the stock market shakes out over time but were all struck by just the sheer amount of cash on the sidelines at this point ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it all right thank you operator operator instructions and well take our next question from gerard cassidy of rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi alastair hi brian alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp hi gerard ph how are you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc alastair coming back to that slide which is obviously quite impressive on deposits particularly the upper left hand graph you presented when you go back to maybe or and take a look at the deposit levels of your company from lets say to you just didnt have the growth that you experienced from the end of through today can you guys share with us what drove this meaningful increase in not only excess deposits but all deposits bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp i think gerard so youve been around long enough to understand some of those dynamics so as we moved through the post financial crisis we had in terms of that chart if you looked at it you had a lot of loans that we ran off because they werent core loans anymore and kind of troughed out in the billion level and then grew out from there and in thats when we started driving responsible growth it was a call to grow now that we pushed out a lot of stuff from the financial crisis and got it behind us so the loans then started picking up but if you remember back then well i think we had almost billion if i remember right in if you looked at the slide on loans and the nonlineofbusiness loans are billion or something like that and its down to billion so think about that dimension so as we run that down and could grow we could overcome it and so then on the growth of loan size its driven by discipline of where we want to play and the card business is getting it positioned right now we could start to push from there whether its on home equity business on the auto loan business and on the commercial side it was we had less issues after the financial crisis in commercial but kind of getting through all that it was getting to their credit quality we wanted and a source of great growth for us from and beyond has been weve probably gone from i dont know billion billion of outstanding loans in the international part of matthews business in gcib to almost billion type of number so our expansion of our international capabilities and done with great credit work by geoff greener and team and bruce thompson and team so putting all that together thats the loan side on the deposit side it really started with a focus that began really prior to in the middle of financial crisis and beyond where we said were going to go for core checking accounts in consumer primary checking accounts drive customer satisfaction drive organic growth and not care about the number of sales as much as the net growth and net sales and as the team dean and thong over time and then aron and holly now have continued to push that adding millionish net new checking accounts all core weve gone from core to weve gone from customer satisfaction to the highest levels ever in the mid indiscernible et cetera et cetera attrition down to lowest ever preferred rewards kicked in and all that has led to higher and higher balance retention per account and then also more accounts and so weve probably grown in the consumer from i think around billion at the beginning of the to now at billion and that was economic growth and economy grows but thats way outsized and thats whats driven the real value of the deposit franchise and then wealth management again after merrill putting it together and then driving that core aspects between the team there has kept us up to billion thats from 200andsomething prepandemic and probably less than that i think it was billion at the time of the merger so all these things are just part of it in the gts business investments that have driven those products so that spread is high and growing again which is kind of counterintuitive to the narrative that even one of your colleagues mentioned earlier which is leave aside all the quantitative tightening and all the interest rate and all the stuff thats supposed to happen quarter afterquarter were now growing the amount of deposits over the top of the loans and the loans hopefully will kick back in and grow a little faster but they still wont use a lot of those balances up and so we feel very good about that position bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 and those deposits as you can see on the bottom of page lefthand side allin cost is basis points against the fed funds rate of and the rate of change in those deposit prices have flattened out to be very modest quarter over linked quarter and thats just a tremendous leverage for the company gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc really helpful brian thank you maybe as a followup i think alastair you pointed too that your cet1 ratios is basel iii endgame indiscernible youre very comfortable with it can you guys share with us whats the latest and we all read about the watering down of basel iii endgame do you guys have a sense when we may actually see a final proposal could it get kicked in to next year possibly alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp look we dont have an update on the timing yet gerard were in the same place you are were kind of waiting for the rules to come out and were still listening for updates from the fed chair and the vice chair and well wait till we see those come out gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp the key is indiscernible were sitting even under the current interpretation we told you earlier on without any modifications were sitting on enough cet1 nominal amount billion that exceeds what we need for the increase in rwa under the current version of the rules they proposed anything that changes in that would be positive gerard so we dont need to retain capital to meet those standards we dont so were off and running gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc appreciate it brian thank you both of you brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp i believe thats one more question okay operator yes and well take that question from jim mitchell of seaport global brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp good morning jim bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc oh hey hey good morning good morning sorry maybe just one last followup on that last question from gerard if basel iii is reduced as powell suggested is it with limited loan growth just more likely to be put towards buybacks or do you see opportunities beyond just loan growth whether its building growing the trading balance sheet or are there other opportunities to deploy that capital to drive growth just curious how you deploy that brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well number one our primary interest is to use the capital to support our customer businesses so youve seen that happen in the markets business as we said it was one of the best quarters in a decade first quarter that is a multiyear process of building up not only the balance sheet and capital committed to the business but importantly also the investment in systems and technology and risk management and those things they continue to make money almost every trading day over the last several years so thats where wed like to use it supporting that business and supporting loan business supporting all the businesses the reality is is outside of the capital markets business then you go to loan growth and the kind of loan growth in midsingle digits that doesnt eat a lot of the capital up so then its just there to be returned and so weve got two basic phenomenon one is we storehoused a bunch of capital if you think about the last few years between the changes in ccar a few years ago that changed the capital dimension then the proposed rules and then now whatever happens with it so there were sort of in the pandemic before that we were sitting on a fair amount of capital that should be released over time here and then secondly the question will be what those rules are going forward and then third will be what you need to support the business which again thats our primary responsibility but generally that is a modest amount of capital and so most of our desire is to is really deploy more expenses in technology investments and weve gone from billion to billion in annual technology investments across the last couple years more branches but thats more of an expense question than a capital question jim jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right right okay thanks a lot brian t moynihan chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp all right i think thats all lee correct okay why dont we wrap it up here thank you for your time and attention this quarter marks another quarter of strong organic growth across every businesses continued this quarter good fees and what we call fees and commissions in the wealth management business investment banking and trading nii continues to outperform what we told you last quarter for the quarter first quarter we rolled that into second quarter and we expect to continue the performance in that as we go through the trough and meet the higher second half of the year we continue to manage expenses well under the inflation rate and we start with strong capital and liquidity and a strong balance sheet so we are the team did a great job this quarter and we look forward to talking to you next quarter
