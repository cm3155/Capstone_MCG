economy in the world we continue to be wellpositioned here in driving market share gains and great servicing capabilities this quarter is also one of transition from a period of rising rates in to one that is moving through the impact of the declining rates in the second half of how do you run a company a big bank and deal with lower rates well we drive what we can control with our sempiternal commitment to responsible growth we drive more loans more deposits more assets under management and driving growth with the right pricing and at the right risks we also have to manage our cost base carefully while making the required investments and we have to take advantage of the strong balance sheet to provide good capital return to our shareholders at bank of america we check the box in all these in the quarter we grew loans average loans by in our lines of businesses we grew the deposits by with very disciplined deposit pricing our expenses were relatively flat again while we increased investments across our whole company and in doing that we earned billion after tax this quarter with a return on tangible common equity of and due to our strong balance sheet we returned billion in capital to our common shareholders this quarter at the same time we deployed capital to support growth for our clients communities and teammates lets start on slide im referring to the full year results excluding our third quarter joint venture impairment charge we generated billion in net income in a record for our company that was better than the prior years results we were also able to reduce shares by driving earnings per share up by for these results were driven by execution on all the pillars of responsible growth we grew by serving our clients well and improved our market share across the board remained disciplined in our risk and our client selection framework and by the way our results are more sustainable as our focus on operational excellence led to a efficiency ratio in while making the investments we need to make our return on equity was for the year and our return on tangible common equity was for the year record earnings allowed us to invest in our client capabilities invest in our people and invest in our communities all while holding the expenses in check take a look at slide you can see the investments we made across all our constituencies and at the same time we delivered strong returns for our shareholders to deliver for our clients we continued our investment in talent in we grew the company by teammates overall we hired teammates in including new employees from low and moderateincome neighborhoods college and mba graduates and we also completed our fiveyear goal to hire military veterans into our company we completed more than billion in new technology code initiatives last year building on years investments in awardwinning digital and mobile capabilities to serve our clients better and help our teammates be more efficient most importantly these investments are bearing fruit as you can see in our customer usage numbers that paul will talk about just a simple example we surpassed million clients using erica our industryleading consumer ai agent we introduced erica about months ago and now are starting to reap the scale benefits erica is an example of billions of dollars of scaled innovation fueled by our work on operational excellence these savings generated by bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 operational excellence also enabled us to make capital investments in our company of billion during for newer modernized facilities and other related priorities and in the past three years weve built new financial centers and modernized more than for our employees we will start at per hour minimum starting pay beginning in march the cost of all these enhancements importantly are in our run rate of expenses providing the capacity to keep investing in the future without increasing expenses also for for the third consecutive year we shared our financial success with our teammates with special compensation awards to approximately of them three years of special compensation awards totaled billion in compensation in addition to all other bonuses and merit and everything else allowing our teammates to do more with their families last year we also delivered more than billion of community development financing for affordable housing and other important local priorities weve made more than of philanthropic contributions to help drive economic mobility including workforce training and development and many other local priorities where we help to make a difference we also completed our 10year billion environmental business initiative goal in weve made that commitment four years ago and it was a 10year commitment and we completed it years early thats why this year we set a new goal of billion environmental initiatives across the next decade it was a strong year for our company and our team capping our first decade but here at bank of america we have a saying nice start we know we can do so much more in the future so on slide i want to talk about the line of business results the teams hard work has created strong improvement in earnings across the board in our lines of business dean athanasia and the consumer team generated an impressive billion in aftertax earnings in our consumer and small business group by driving responsible growth they continue to provide real value for clients through innovative products and services while driving improvements in upgraded facilities entering new markets and driving innovation consumers record level efficiency and customer satisfaction scores reflect our hard work done the right way andy sieg and katy knox together run our global wealth investment management businesses they drove net new household growth in and more integration across those businesses with the rest of the franchise merrill lynch alone brought in more than net new affluent households during margins in that business remain near the record levels we generated billionplus in quarterly earnings in the quarters of and topped this quarter at trillion in client balances for the first time tom montag and his team across the global banking and global markets franchises are running one of the biggest commercial lending businesses in the world and one of the top marketmaking investment banking platforms this powerful combination of global banking and global markets generated billion in aftertax net income this year the team continues to get its fair share of the fee pools across the globe and became more important partners for many of the worlds largest clients with a renewed focus our investment banking team regained some of the lost market share from a couple years ago and paul will give you those numbers later matthew koder and team have done a great job of doing that in addition that team across the board continues to drive innovation in our global treasury services platform paul is going to show you some of those capabilities in the slides later all these business accomplishments across all these businesses while driving relatively flat costs lets move to trends in slide our strong balance sheet and strong earnings have driven a corresponding strong increase in our return of capital we have now dropped below billion shares outstanding billion shares on a fully diluted basis as shown here on the left side of the page in total we reduced the share count by nearly bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 billion shares from its peak a few years ago as we look into paul will give you some specific guidance on the companys view of what we see and our outlook but for more general guidance our research team our awardwinning research team sees more generally the us gdp growth at just below and a global gdp growth just above we at bank of america see in our consumer business a substantial amount of activity in our consumer business we see that our customers are coming off a strong finish in in their spending activity in addition theres good loan demand this results from good employment levels and growing wages at bank of america spending by our consumers grew at over trillion in spending from over we saw solid loan demand in our commercial client base throughout the year but that moderated in the second half of the year as worries about global economic uncertainty and all the issues that are talked about every day dragged on today we see some resolution of those issues and that combined with continued consumer strength leads us to expect to see businesses continue their solid activity and were hearing more optimism all this provides a great backdrop to drive responsible growth and continue to deliver for you with that ill turn it over to paul paul m donofrio chief financial officer bank of america corp thanks brian good morning everyone you can see the summary of our  results on slide and im going to begin on slide in the fourth quarter we reported billion in net income and in eps eps increased from  reflecting modestly lower earnings more than offset by a reduction in average diluted shares returns remained strong in  with a return on assets of basis points and a return on tangible common equity of well above the companys cost of capital our results were driven by our teams focus and solid progress on managing what we can control and gaining market share in an economy that grew at a lowsingle digit pace in  we again stayed focused on what we can control client activity remains solid allowing the benefits of loan and deposit growth to aid in offsetting the negative impact of lower shortterm rates over the past three quarters we also continued to see healthy consumer trends in spending and asset quality lastly we experienced a nice rebound in ficc trading from a more negative environment a year ago so having set the stage lets turn to the details starting with the balance sheet on slide overall compared to the end of  the balance sheet was relatively flat at trillion as growth of both loans and securities was modestly offset by lower global market assets deposits grew billion and were first deployed to fund billion of loan growth with most of the excess funding the growth in debt securities liquidity improved as the average global liquidity sources benefited from deposit growth shareholders equity declined billion driven mostly by the return of excess capital in  we returned billion in capital through net share repurchases and dividends which exceeded the billion earned oci declined by roughly billion note our book value per share of has improved from  with respect to regulatory metrics we remain comfortably above our minimum requirements driven by the return of the excess capital i just reviewed our cet1 standardized ratio decreased to but remained well above our minimum requirement our riskweighted assets increased modestly from consumer loan growth and increased global banking exposures lastly our tlac ratio also remained comfortably above our requirements bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 looking at how client activity impacted average balances lets start with deposits on slide average deposits grew billion or yearoveryear for years now we have grown deposits on a yearoveryear basis every quarter by more than billion consumer banking deposits grew billion or as we believe customers value the convenience of our financial centers and atm network leading online and mobile capabilities and our unique preferred rewards program but much of this growth continues to be led by checking balances which we considered to be the core operational deposits of these customers wealth management deposits grew billion or yearoveryear global banking deposits grew billion or yearoveryear and reflected both our strong gts platform and the additional bankers we have deployed over the past couple of years looking at average loans on slide you see pretty consistent client activity overall average loans of billion were up more than yearoveryear more importantly average loans in our lines of business grew billion or yearoveryear as consumer loans grew and commercial loans grew as you can see in the bottom righthand chart we continued to demonstrate a fairly consistent range of responsible growth commercial loan growth was broadbased loans to middle market clients grew but i would note the more stable linked quarter balances here as revolver utilization moved a bit lower we also saw growth in lending to small businesses growing and within consumer we saw strong growth of residential mortgages i would also note the stability of credit card balances which reflects our decision last year to pull back on less profitable promotional balances as we continued to prioritize sustainable longterm profitability turning to slide and net interest income on a gaap nonfte basis in  nii was billion billion on an fte basis and was relatively flat compared to  the benefits of loan and deposit growth coupled with disciplined pricing mostly offset the impact across shortterm rates of a linkedquarter 47basispoint decline in the average fed funds rate and while longterm rates were up modestly on a spot basis on average for the quarter there was little change for the full year of gaap nii of billion was up despite lower shortterm rates this is consistent with the perspective we had conveyed to you since the middle of the year we remained disciplined with respect to deposit pricing in  the rate paid on total interestbearing deposits of basis points declined basis points in consumer banking which accounts for more than half of our trillion of deposits customer pricing remained relatively unchanged on the other hand in global banking and wealth management the decline from  and the rate paid on interestbearing deposits was more in line with the 38basispoint drop in average one month libor okay looking forward as we move into let me start by saying our expectations assume a stable economic and interest rate environment ie flat rates relative to the end of the year given those assumptions we expect nii in  to be lower than  as the benefits of loan and deposit growth will be more than offset by three things first with respect to  we will have one less day of interest second we expect lower loan yields to be more fully reflected from the late october fed rate cut third reinvestment rates are expected to dilute securities yields despite fractionally higher long end rates moving to  we typically experience seasonally lower nii for two reasons first we typically see higher interest expense from funding increased seasonal global markets client activity in equities the benefit of this activity shows up in noninterest income instead of interest income second we also typically see lower average card balances as clients pay down their holiday balances both of these seasonal patterns have historically led to lower nii in  compared to  so we would expect nii in the first two quarters of to be a bit lower than  from there we would expect nii to rise modestly in the second half of the year driven by an additional day of interest and continued loan and deposit growth bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 turning to slide and quarterly expenses over the past two years at billion this quarter expenses were higher than  as increased investments throughout in people real estate and technology initiatives were largely offset by savings from operational excellence and lower amortization of intangibles we have been operating in a tight range for more than two years now with quarterly expense in the low billion range in all but one quarter if you adjust for the impairment so annually weve been able to maintain a billion expense base despite increased investments in tech infrastructure buildings people philanthropy and the other costs that brian mentioned in the opening of the call with respect to head count yearoveryear savings from improved processes and workflows allowed us to fund an increase in the number of sales professionals as our lobs added nearly associates over the past months with respect to outlook our expectations for expense in havent really changed from where we provided it in despite all the added costs of the higher investments and unknowns like brexit and others since we expect our full year expense to be in the low billion range this year and as long as client activity and the economic environment remains stable our investment plans will likely remain unchanged having said that i want to provide you with a few reminders with respect to expenses first  is expected to include about million of seasonally elevated personnel costs related to payroll taxes with the remaining quarters of expected to return to a low billion range also beginning in  the accounting for the bams jv is expected to change following its dissolution at that time we will separately record revenue and expense from merchant servicing operations rather than reflecting our share of the joint venture earnings as a single amount in other income this will gross up both expenses and revenue with little bottom line impact and like we told you in  its not included in our forward guidance we will update you as we move closer to that timeframe all right turning to asset quality on slide our underwriting standards have been responsible and strong for years now and asset quality trends reflect this even in this relatively benign credit environment total net charge offs in  were million compared to million in  when comparing to  remember we sold in  we sold some loans in  that resulted in recoveries totaling million that reduced net chargeoffs adjusting for those recoveries net chargeoffs declined million and the net chargeoff ratio declined basis points to basis points compared to  net chargeoffs were modestly higher driven primarily by seasoning of the card portfolio provision expense was million and mostly masked net chargeoffs with only modest releases in both  and  on slide we break out credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios these metrics show you that asset quality remained strong in both categories before turning to the business segments i will just provide a couple of perspectives on cecl our day one implementation resulted in a billion increase in allowance this is in line with the last update we gave you all else equal this would lower our cet1 ratio by roughly basis points but as you know it is phased into regulatory capital evenly through okay turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on slide consumer banking produced another solid quarter of revenue and earnings but was heavily impacted by lower rates in the second half of net income of billion declined as revenue fell as you know we have been renovating and adding financial centers adding sales professionals and advancing digital capabilities plus we increased our minimum wage in and will again in  despite the cost of increased investments we have been able to hold expenses relatively flat and our efficiency ratio was away from the impact of rates which we cant control client momentum continued as we saw healthy spending borrowing and savings by clients as a result yearoveryear average deposits increased by billion up to bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 billion while maintaining strong pricing discipline client investments increased to billion up year overyear to billion driven primarily by the market but we also saw billion of client flows and our total net accounts grew loans were up a healthy driven by home loans debit and credit spending by our customers was up yearoveryear consistent with a record holiday season and asset quality in this segment remained strong with a net chargeoff ratio of basis points down modestly from last year turning to slide i will quickly note continued positive trends across deposits loans and investments all of which i touched upon earlier this level of activity continues to drive the acknowledgements and rankings in the upper left and this is a short list of the more than industry awards consumer and digital banking received in turning to slide digital banking continued to drive growth and client engagement as we continued to invest heavily in this channel as a strong complement to our financial centers and atm network together they allowed our customers to bank with us anywhere anytime and anyway they want over of our clients are now digitally active and logged in billion times this year thats up yearoveryear digital channels generated of overall sales of mortgages and of client direct auto loans originated through our mobile app or online banking sites the digital mortgage experience itself originated billion in loans in as we continue to add capabilities such as the ability to transfer heloc balances on a mobile device and with respect to mobile car shopping we closed the year with the ability to provide clients access to roughly million cars from our participating dealer inventories our market share of zelle payments continued to increase this year as well we now have million zelle users and they sent and received million transfers this year totaling over billion erica surpassed million total users and completed nearly million requests since its launch with penetration of active bac mobile users of total deposits are now coming from mobile and over of our clients have gone completely paperless enhancing our efficiency and their experience and customers increased their use of our mobile banking app to make appointments with million digital appointments scheduled in up yearover year our efforts to move customers past enrollment to engagement in digital capabilities are stronger than ever and we believe industryleading turning to global wealth and investment management on slide strong results were led by growth across aum loans and deposits as well as good market conditions in the quarter but also reflected the headwinds of lower interest rates record level client balances topped trillion and our full year pretax margin was with billion in deposits this segment would rank standalone as the seventh or eighth largest bank in the us so when rates fall ph gwim feels it but much of the impact of falling rates was offset by advisory fees generated from our industryleading wealth management platform net income was just over billion down from  reflecting lower interest rates and the absence of a prior year gain from the sale of a noncore asset which also impacted the revenue comparisons excluding the prior year gain revenue was flat and earnings grew asset management fees grew yearoveryear due to higher market valuations and the fees from aum flows which more than offset general pricing pressures and lower transactional revenue expenses decreased slightly as investments in sales professionals technology and our brand were more than offset by lower intangible amortization and deposit insurance costs digital engagement with affluent clients continued to increase in importance as of merrill clients are actively using our mobile or online platforms and that statistic increased to more than for our private bank clients bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 moving to slide gwim activity reflects the confidence clients place in bank of america and its advisors at both merrill and the private bank as brian mentioned household growth has been strong as merrill added more than net new households this year and we added more private bank relationships in than we did in on the bottom right note the billion increase in client balances in  billion of that increase reflected strong market conditions increasing the value of assets billion of the increase is from client flows aum flows accounted for billion while brokerage flows contributed billion banking product flows were driven by loans of billion which doubled from and deposit flows were modestly negative as clients shifted cash back into investments during the year following the equity market declines average deposits rose turning to global banking on slide the business earned billion and generated return on allocated capital in the quarter an decline in net income was driven by lower nii and higher investment costs which outpaced the improvement from investment banking income and leasing related gains continued strong deposit and loan growth reflects the benefit of adding hundreds of bankers over the past few years increasing our client coverage as well as continued advancement in how we deliver our loan product and treasury services these investments will continue to benefit the franchise for many years to come as new bankers deepen existing relationships and add new ones looking at trends on slide and comparing to  last year throughout the year we continued to add investment bankers both in the us and internationally with a focus on expanding our client coverage this benefited nii fees with  fees of nearly billion up yearoveryear doubledigit increases in both debt and equity underwriting fees led the yearoveryear improvement bank of america was involved in of the top debt deals and of the top equity deals in the quarter based upon dealogic data this performance drove a basis point improvement in market share for the full year turning to slide one of the reasons for the growth in deposits in global banking has been our consistent investment over multiple years in digital capabilities and transaction services note the growth in mobile and digital usage at the top of the page and our focus on solutions for clients on the bottom of the page switching to global markets on slide as i usually do i will talk about results excluding dva global markets produced million of earnings yearoveryear revenue was up from both higher sales and trading results and improved investment banking fees expenses were up a more modest yearoveryear within revenue sales and trading improved yearoveryear driven by fixed income currency and commodities with a more riskon environment when compared to  last year ficc was up from  while equities declined modestly ficc revenue showed improved results across most products but was particularly strong in mortgage products the muted performance in equities was driven by lower client activities and derivatives which was partially offset by our financing business where we have focused some investments on slide you can see that our mix of sales and trading revenue remains weighted to domestic activity where global fee pools are centered within ficc revenue mix remained weighted towards credit products and importantly please note on the bottom left at roughly billion the consistency of our sales and trading revenue over the past six years in the face of declining fee pools it is particularly noteworthy considering the risk reduction noted at the bottom right this goes against the perception that these revenues are generally considered to be more variable finally turning to slide we show all other which reported a profit of million comparing against  is tough because that period included the billion pretax impairment charge on our bank of america merchant services joint venture but there are two things worth noting as i close out first other income at the bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 total company level this quarter included taxadvantaged investment partnership losses that were about million higher when you compare to  the benefits of this activity shows up in our global banking business and are produced by client activity related to taxadvantaged solar and wind investments these investments generate good returns however the partnership losses which reduce noninterest income and the tax benefit in our tax line from these investments are not always realized in the same quarter depending upon the type of investment the second thing i want to mention is the effective tax rate in the quarter of approximately it included the impact of higher tax credits from the increased taxadvantaged investments and it also included roughly million in discrete benefits from the resolution of several tax matters absent the discrete benefits in the quarter our  tax rate would have been roughly and absent any unusual items this is roughly where we expect the etr for fullyear to be so thanks and with that i will open it up to qa question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question today from john mcdonald with autonomous research please go ahead john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning paul i wanted to ask on the nii outlook when you put together your what you commentary about the quarters yearoveryear does that imply flat to down a little bit maybe on the nii in terms of your outlook against flat rates paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah yearoveryear modestly i would say john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research down modestly paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yes john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then how are you feeling i guess if we think about a positive operating leverage for this year you mentioned the stability in expenses while you continue to invest how are you feeling on fee income growth and when you wrap it all together the prospects for positive operating leverage into bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp so obviously we talked about in the prepared remarks the transition that were going through in the rate environment i would just remind everybody we had consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage and admittedly its a little bit more difficult to achieve operating leverage given the decline in interest rates last year and the associated impact on nii as i said though assuming a more stable rate environment we would expect nii to return to growth in the second half of driven by loan and deposit growth and remember nii is not directly linked to expenses the way other revenue is in for example investment banking sales and trading wealth management we run and invest in the company for the longterm sustainability and for growth and by the way these investments over many years lay the foundation for operating leverage so having said all that were not blind to changes in the operating environment but we are also not managing rigidly to quarterly financial metrics were focused on the things that we can control like driving like client activity deposits loans investments efficiency improvements through our focus on operational excellence so if things change well adjust but currently we feel our client activity and market share gains continue to support our investment plans in the nearterm john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay fair enough thank you operator well take our next question from glenn schorr with evercore please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc thank you i have a followup question on your comments on the promo balances in cards and your pullback there and im curious if that is a function of pricing getting tougher there terms getting tougher there or is that your just responsible thought process years into a recovery paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp i think its more a reflection of responsible growth and how we run how were focused on the customer and how were focused on total revenue and not necessarily nii or fees when you look at card balances they certainly reflect a couple of items that we talked about and it certainly reflects our focus more on profitability first weve been reevaluating some relationship prospects who are just looking to gain rewards or take shortterm advantage of promo balances so clearly thats affected balances a little bit also with less promo balances the percentage of the portfolio ph paying off each month has risen a bit i think what you see though is when you look at our riskadjusted margin thats up basis points yearoveryear to if you adjust out the gains we had last year and we continue to add more than million cards each month again with a focus on profitability of new accounts so i think that lines going to start to grow from here brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp i think glenn just to be to pauls last point production of new customers taking the card product from us and the usage continues to grow so we had millionplus new cardholders we still have a lot of room to go from a bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 twothirds type of penetration of the customer base and then how many people use it as a primary card so we really focus a lot on that and while were focused on that generating new customers who are surfing is not exactly the strategy so its a mix of profitability but also really sticking to that core holistic customer strategy glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc appreciate that just one more maybe on gwim so markets up a lot and more people going feebased offset lower rates and you talked about that so weve been hanging in this to range which is great but the question i have is as scale continues to build and all the investments that youve made there can we see margins start to tick up a little bit above there i know were constrained by payouts and things like that just curious the bigger picture over the next couple of years brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah so think about it in two dimensions one inside the wealth management business is a very large bank so if rates is stable from here then the loan and deposit growth which have been strong will then pick up that and thats very leveraged to the margin or contribute to margin thats one point so youre going through the same twists in that business with the 75basispoint drop in rates in this very late part of the last few months of so thats no different than many other situations so that will mitigate and go forward if you think about the other side of the question which is sort of can you get it higher youve got the basic things the way that compensation system runs from a way of presentation is youve got of the revenue round numbers goes into the compensation so youre basically making on the rather in profit margin which is a pretty strong margin so it has all the opportunities along the dimensions which is indiscernible set of things that we got to go after which is if you think about the merrill edge assets growing in the megi portfolio which is over billion and growing a year type of things as they grow and the products are available to andys whole team of fas that provides additional efficiency and then you think about the digitization of that customer base in both private bank and merrill lynch which is the least penetrated of all the customer bases in terms of digital statements and things like that we can drive the margins that way then the physical plant we continue to increase the density of the physical plant with other physical plant in various cities and towns consolidating offices and getting people into common space that saves money so theres a lot of way we can work on digitization physical plant efficiency adding more financial advisors add more scale and contributing to overhead which then generates more margin so youre working its pretty good to make of your margin after comp and were not changing the comp system so but theres a lot of things forward and i think we can continue to improve it would appear to be easier if in fact rates stay stable we can drive the loan growth which is what our projection is and if rates start rising again well look like heroes in terms of margin but weve been able to sustain it even in a falling rate environment glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc thank you bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 operator our next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning so i wanted to ask a followup on fee income so the nii resiliency has been quite impressive loan deposit account growth as you noted paul and brian continues to track very well the core fee growth was a bit softer this past year it declined modestly despite some of the strong market tailwinds i know brian in the past you havent given explicit guidance on core fee growth expectations but you did note that it should traject in line with gdp and just given some of the moderating us and global gdp growth expectations you cited earlier just trying to think about how we should be modeling or forecasting fee income expectations in the coming years brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp i think each category if you think about the broad categories where most of them come through the strategy in the consumer business has been to reduce reliance over the last decadeplus on penalty fees and things like that we kind of hit status quo on that in other words we brought it down significantly from reg e and all that stuff and its kind of done the interchange in the consumer fee areas the card income and stuff thats through the system at this point the rewards impact that but you get the benefit that in the preferred rewards system through the ability to have that stable margin so i think we should see those fees which have gotten to a point where they ought to grow marginally but remember part of the strategy is to invest in our client base loyalty to our company and our products and so theyll be modest because of the nii growth and think about growth in checking balances yearoveryear in consumer that is helped driven by people consolidating their relationship with you which you pay back through the rewards system through their card usage so its always going to be that when you go to wealth management you tell me what the markets going to do and youll see thatll be heavily influenced there that should grow faster as you know trading as paul said isnt as volatile as people want to discuss it but on the other hand theres compression on the fee side so each of the line items has a different element treasury services revenue is up i think highsingle digits but the fee line piece of it is flattish thats because people are paying through balances so i think that steven a guy like you has been around banks for a long time the differentiation between types of revenue fee versus spread is becoming harder as the business models have morphed them together in just terms of total revenue so we ought to grow revenue slightly faster than the economy and have the expenses grow below that by a couple hundred basis points and weve been able to do that and as this twist in rates ends this quarter youll see us get back on that track as we move through steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for that color brian and maybe just a followup for you paul youve been retaining your substantial percentage of mortgage loans on balance sheet in lieu of selling those loans youre deploying that excess liquidity into mbs and im just wondering as we prepare for cecl does that inform your appetite or your willingness to continue down the same path and just separately just given this strength of your credit position and a relatively clean balance sheet was sort of hoping you guys could be cecl pioneers and maybe the first bank to provide some more concrete guidance in terms of day provision impacts or expectations bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp well on your first point we are originating mortgages and putting of them i think this quarter on the balance sheet theyll continue the trend that weve been doing for many quarters now well see how that develops over the long term but for now thats our plan clearly we consider the effect on liquidity we consider the effect on capital balancing returning capital with growing the balance sheet those loans dont really have a high amount of cecl impact but im not saying were going to never change what were doing there in terms of cecl i think weve given you the guidance that were comfortable with we would expect provision to be a little higher than net chargeoffs in due to cecl when you back everything out weve been running net chargeoffs at approximately billion a quarter we dont see that changing much in the future and when you just factor cecl into that it means that our provision is going to have to be a little bit higher than net chargeoffs brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp you always have to remember that not on the last part but on the first part at the end of the day the reason why we have securities and mortgagebacked securities and treasuries is simple when you generate billion in deposit growth and your loan balances grow by billion or whatever billion or billion the other half has to go to be invested somewhere and youre raising this money and allin costs in the basis points of deposit pricing across the whole board and a lot of its becoming noninterest youre not going to turn that down good customer activity and we dont take credit risk in that part of the portfolio because we take enough credit risk around the rest of the company and so the strategy on the investment side mortgagebacks ph i put with treasuries and think of that as just excess liquidity on mortgages paul told you weve been putting them on the balance sheet because theyre better yielding than mortgagebacked securities and frankly our credit risk is better than the mortgagebacked securities availability so why would we pay somebody else for taking that risk steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc fair enough and i appreciate you guys taking the day plunge as well operator well take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 brian ten years of excellent management here driving the bus on improving operating leverage especially over the past three four years can you give us a sense as to how you see the rate of change go from here because weve had obviously significant improvement in the consumer side and the question i get from people is is it over and by the way how do you generate positive operating leverage in global banks and global markets given the skew to producers and is there that much opportunity in the back office side so maybe if you could hit on those that would be helpful thanks brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp sure so let me paraphrase a little bit but its a delectation to be able to run company with all the power and have the honor of doing it for decades so we just passed the decade with the team and theyve done a great job but what you point out is theyve done a great job of putting the position so if you look at the operating efficiency of the consumer business or the wealth management business or the banking business which we show separately from the markets business you can see these are efficiency ratios here here its how can you improve and betsy what id say is we just dont know how far this digitization of the actual processes and work goes in the company and we just keep coming up we had simplified improved ideas over the last few years weve implemented that continue to produce great savings and so we just dont see an end to that and so leave aside that the economys growing at sub2 level predicted for leave aside that the rate environment is low weve been able to push forward the activities that then can produce more efficiency and we think theres a lot ahead of us and so id like to we say nice start to our team saying thanks for all the hard work youve done but also were only getting started here and if you start thinking about we just passed the number of checking accounts that we had in in this company this quarter and so we ran off all the nonprimary accounts but on the primary accounts the average balance is if you think about the cost of deposits in consumer i think it went down by basis points yearoveryear or something like that so its a grind and its a lot of hard work but incremental efficiency that we can get at this scale by these investments and by the digitization and the further taking out activity which costs more another example is checks written since zelle became really pushed out there about two years ago has started dropping per year so five years ago we had almost billion checks written by consumers now were down to million each one of those checks is a piece of paper that requires processing time and youre seeing that drop by a year is that going to change overnight where theyre gone absolutely not but on the other hand its constant positive operating pressure benefit for us so look for us to improve it across the board your colleague earlier asked about the wealth management business we think we have upside there andy and katy and the teams are working on it theres a lot of process simplification that weve worked on hard but theres a lot ahead of us and then again the markets business the electronification of ficc will make it more and more efficient over time like weve seen in equities as you know though thats a market priced business so youre always fighting the revenue changes at the same time and in fact if you look at most of us from four five years ago we actually had the same amount of trading profits we had then we just turn it into this quarter million of profit generally billion of profit when its going a little bit better and the earlier quarters and the activitys higher thats a good business its just youre fighting both sides of the equation bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 so look for us to improve everything theres room to improve tremendous scale advantages the new markets opening up provide extra lift and its our job to deal with it and the teams excited to betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay good good forward look there paul on the longer term paul maybe i could be a bit nearer term with a question for you i think you mentioned a couple of times that nii expectation for to being down modestly from full year full year but then you talked a little bit about a better second half than first half and maybe you could give us a little more detail on the granularity why you expect that to be the case i assume its with the forward curve and flattish rates but i know you gave us some color earlier on but maybe give a little sense more like whats behind that conviction level that yearonyear you get some improvement in the back half paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp i think its look its about loan and deposit growth and its about deposit pricing discipline on deposit pricing we plan some modest reductions in deposit pricing assuming no further cuts as we continue to bring deposit pricing to an appropriate level given the three cuts that weve experienced if the forward curve materializes and we get another short end cut we expect deposit rate pay for the industry and for us to decline even further as higher passthrough products in wealth management global banking react relatively quickly to any rate cuts so its about the confidence we have in how we price our products and the confidence we have in growing deposits and growing loans the guidance is more about we have one less day in  weve got to deal with we have the second quarter normal activity that we see in equities which again thats a plus that just shows up in noninterest income instead of interest income and by the time you get to the third quarter we would expect assuming the current sort of economic environment we would expect our loan and deposit growth the lack of that seasonality the deposit pricing to have an effect and well start growing again brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp id just add to that your question johns question go the same direction which is youve got this quarter and the first couple quarters because of the dynamics paul just described that you have to push through but what we see is getting back on as we move into the middle of were back on that basic operating leverage through nii stability to growth and expense flatness but it just takes a little while to get underneath the basis point rate cut in four months betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thats helpful thank you operator our next question comes from jim mitchell with buckingham research please go ahead james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc hey good morning guys maybe i could just follow up on that last question in a different way is your expectation that the net interest margin should start to stabilize in the back half of the year is that what gives you the confidence in the nii growth or is it really do we still should expect a grind down of nims but the balance sheet bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 growth starts to take over how do we think about when in the current rate environment the sort of net interest margin assuming mix is unchanged obviously thats a big assumption but do we assume that nim starts to stabilize in the second half of this year brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp i think thats what youve correctly summarized succinctly what we said james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc okay so maybe i get another question so just on the deposits brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well reward you a bonus question for that one james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc just on the deposit growth the industry weve seen some acceleration in we have lower shortterm rates we have the fed balance sheet expansion there tends to be some seasonality in how do we do you think this acceleration can continue into at least the first half of this year i guess how do you think about the deposit growth and if we could see continued sort of above midsingledigit growth brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yes i think if you look at page when you have rate movement due to the types of things that reestablish reserve levels by the federal reserve et cetera et cetera et cetera thats going to affect the lower our markets business in the lower right hand and the banking stuff like that but it really doesnt have that much of an impact in the wealth management and the consumer banking area and thats really what drives the value so for the 700oddbillion in the consumer business which grew checking at yearoveryear and thats fairly consistent with what theyve been doing you remember thats basis point allin including the interest bearing part of it which also grew yearoveryear so thats million a year in total interest expense for billion of deposits thats what drives the economics and then wealth management and global banking also so that doesnt really affect it by all the sort of broad macroeconomic variables thats just us doing a great job with consumers great of customers satisfaction great product capabilities great high touch high tech and then generating more and more checking accounts while the average balance for checking account is and plus and growing and thats whats going to drive it so id say youre absolutely right there can be momentary things that would enhance deposit growth in some of the pure institutional businesses but it doesnt make much difference to the general us consumer james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc okay thats helpful thanks bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 operator our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp hi mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc a simple question is what is the dollar amount of tech spending and investment spending in and how does that compare to last year and this coming one and the backdrop for that question is the efficiency youve gotten a lot of questions on efficiency on this call and it was worse in the fourth quarter and your efficiency for the year is not where some other banks are targeting like now we know that youre spending a lot of money we can see slide youve pointed out that the spending is paying off so if you could just put a wrap around the spending and put a number to it then we as analysts can figure out okay a more core efficiency level if you would brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp so one of the things that just in our efficiency ratio compared to other people are for the year but remember that we have a lot more wealth management at pretax margin ie efficiency ratio than anyone else does that changes that answer relative to some of the other core banking peers its just a bigger bigger number because we have the biggest business of trillion and thats just making billion a quarter after tax at the best margins but its just the sheer mass so when you look at it by business unit by business unit our efficiency is the top in the class its just our mix is different so ill let you figure that out mike but back to your tech spend we spent billion billion or billion in the same in we have it scheduled to be the same this year its just this constant level of spending now its different projects every year thats pure technology initiatives you put that on top of the backbone and everything and the number people could talk about would be higher but that is just to drive new products and capabilities through the system and we arent changing that because thats whats driving that ability to keep expenses flat if you look across the chart paul showed you when you see and and the expenses per quarter running billion billion et cetera think about how much weve done in there in terms of hundreds of new branches thousands or complete redos new buildings for our teammates in wealth management et cetera et cetera and so those are tremendous investment levels that are all in the run rate while were chopping away and thats coming from the operational excellence so were spending that much on technology but the question isnt spend mike its are you getting the usage out of it and thats where you got to look at things like the usage of zelle which were growing a year the usage of the cashpro mobile which grew over a year the usage what i talked about in checks written coming down what i talked about that we have branches but in there weve actually opened up in new markets over the last couple years branches branches et cetera and continue to do that so the efficiency bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 of the rest of the markets funds that even though your numbers of branches are relatively flattish or coming down slightly so its a complex set of things but hopefully that gives you some color mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah i guess ill try one more time since its not in your tech number like you are expanding to new markets you are opening new branches you are hiring new associates how much does this investing increase the growth rate of expenses brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp its billion so its in the run rate last year and it will be a like amount this year could you take half of that out you could itd just be not the right thing to do for the company but its paid for by the cost takeout it supports or the mix in how the customer uses which provides efficiency so more than of our auto loans are originated digitally today i think we did something like billion or billion mortgage originations so what were reaping the benefits of mike three years hence is the investments we made in as you go into are produced for example digital auto did not exist and now youre getting just think how much more efficient that process is digital mortgages mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc let me just try one more time this tech spend to run the bank change the bank i assume youre spending more to change the bank today versus three or four years ago and that mix goes more towards change the bank what are those figures and where do you think theyre headed brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp the billionplus obviously with brexit behind us with a lot of the regulatory environment rules behind us in terms of implementing the ccar and the capital rules and a lot of the modeling and youre still spending money improving that data to make those models work thats gone the only thing that works against that is so yes if you thought about how much is going to sort of new business initiatives the mobile banking feature functionality its higher in it was in and it was in largely around this issue that youre running off some of these longterm projects which is good mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is open brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp good morning gerard bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning brian how are you brian can you remind us you touched on it in some of your comments already about the number of checks that were processed five years ago versus today and when you move it from the paper to the digital can you remind us what the cost savings are when you do that per unit brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp so that was going to be checks written by our customers which is this good point because that stops the thing before it starts basically if you look at deposit which i think is what youre referencing gerard we are now more mobile than we are at the branches and have been for about five quarters and the atms are still half the mobile is a little over like or something like that and branches are the rest so if you think about that that is in physical movement and at the atm round numbers gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great and then moving over to credit can you guys give us any color i mean credit is strong across the board for almost all the banks are you guys keeping an eye on any particular sectors within your portfolio and then as part of that question weve sensed from some of your peers that have reported that the corporates or commercial customers seem to be maybe a little more optimistic in the fourth quarter because of some of these trade issues if you could comment on that if youre seeing that in your customer base as well brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp ill take the second half and ill let paul yes youre seeing with the leave aside what happens daytoday but generally the companies are seeing the resolutions emerge for some of these issues that makes them a little bit more confident in terms of their activities well hopefully see that in the first half of this year if nothing goes backwards the market being up obviously gives people a good feeling but one other thing you have to think about is in the first part of gerard you had your inventory decline a recession as people would call it that went through the system so youve entered a new place right so you come down you hit a bottom and then you start to grow out from there were kind of in that transition phase so i think the combination of the external environment getting the deal of the day with china obviously is a resolution of one of the issues that was over peoples minds there are other usmca everybody says its going to be passed i think if that got passed it would be very helpful to people the fact that people have done what they needed to do it was during the year to change supply chains and think about it thats disruptive without endpoint value to the customer so to speak and its like us with brexit we spent millionplus money the customers didnt get better services out of we just had to create more entities and get them up and running those things are sort of through the system so i think its thats what youre feeling is a little bit of a relief on the other side of that work which was being done and worry which was being done without a lot of activity and so even capital expenditures which grew grew at a much lower rate off the high in youre starting our experts say will stabilize and kind of come out from there and on credit paul bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp sure so on credit id start by saying that we are always running through the portfolio routinely analyzing various sectors bringing it to senior management discussing it so weve got a real great process for always looking for some risks that are only arising as you know weve been running the company with strong underwriting standards for years now you see that in our ccar results so i mean i hesitate to sort of pick one sector or another because we notice stuff out in the marketplace but it may not affect us directly given how weve run the company for years now but if youre looking for some sectors that were paying attention to not that we think were overly concerned about them given how weve manage the company but were certainly paying attention to the leveraged loan market leveraged lending were certainly paying attention to energy with respect to natural gas prices were certainly looking at retail with respect to enclosed malls weve got our eye on always have our eye on spots around the world that may be experiencing a little disruption so thats how id answer that question gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you operator well now go to ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning just a question on the balance sheet and capital so youre at cet1 your stated target has been around were still waiting for the scb finalization two questions so one any anticipated changes to where you think your capital goal might be depending on what we get and then secondly have you gotten to a point where you might rethink the mix between your dividend payout which is lower than peers and the buyback in terms of the mix thanks paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp maybe ill start on i guess buffers and brian you might want to pick up on the dividends and buybacks but look today as you point out we have a meaningful cushion so its really not an issue for us right now in terms of what our ultimate buffer is going to be when we dont have as much of a cushion we havent really talked about that publicly because we dont think it makes sense today to prejudge what a buffer needs be given the size of the current cushion and given as you mentioned regulations scb other things are still changing and lots of things can affect that buffer when we get there but i would just emphasize we have a sizable buffer right now brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp in terms of dividend versus buyback we will keep increasing the dividend as we move up to sort of the level in earnings payout weve been clear about that and then the rest will go into reducing the share count and if you look at the page we showed you earlier part of the issue was the share count was a lot higher than people expected sort of in the timeframe after the merrill transaction bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 so were pushing that back down and we think thats a good use of our capital we dont need the capital to fund the loan growth and deposit growth youre seeing us able to do that through continuing to finetune the balance sheet and so expect us to move the dividend up consistent with what weve done before assuming ccar approval and all that good stuff but the idea is well keep it a level that allows us to use the share buyback to help drive the eps growth and you saw the benefits of that yearoveryear in an environment where the rate movements made earnings flatten in the second half of the year what you saw was the eps yearoveryear was up doubledigits because we can retire the shares and so we think thats the best thing to do for the shareholders ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood thank you guys operator well take our next question from matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi guys brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp hi matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i was just wondering if you could talk about the pace of loan growth that youre expecting for maybe both kind of within the business lines and then net of some of the drive for runoff and then the drivers of growth and if thats changing at all versus what its been the last kind of months obviously commercial industry has slowed maybe thats temporary so just talk about the pace and drivers of loan growth this year thanks paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp sure so look growth in our business segments should continue to be kind of midsingle digits as you know we grew this quarter both consumer and gwim grew at driven by increased residential mortgage activity global banking grew yearoveryear and that was driven by large corporates middle market companies leasing activity and solid growth in international regions so pretty broadbased we anticipate solid growth in consumer loans assuming the current economic environment as well as the sort of pullthrough of applications through the mortgage applications through the pipeline with respect to card weve already talked a little about that we expect we can start growing card over time here with respect to residential mortgages originations were strong this quarter theyre up significantly so thats going to translate to solid  growth however you have to remember that thats going to be partially offset by continued runoff of the noncore portfolio we expect auto growth to be up modestly yearoveryear we expect solid growth in small business and remember in all of these categories that im talking about we remain focused on prime and super prime and on commercial loans our outlook remains favorable again growth year overyear should be in sort of midsingle digits so thats how id run through it bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then netting out the kind of midsingle digit growth in the business segments with the runoff do you think you can kind of stay in this pace of growth that you saw this quarter as some of the macro holds paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yes brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yes and if you look at the runoff chart on the loan page there in the righthand corner you see that we basically have gotten really to the point where thats now natural runoff there wont be any sales of major impacts for purposes that were doing before to continue to move loans of which we werent getting income on because of their status in terms of restructuring and things like that out and clean the portfolio up thats just smaller so i think that helps the overall nominal growth number of the company paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp its going to be billion billion matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay sorry might be billion or billion of loan sale but nothing major is what youre saying paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp no no not loan sales the runoff the runoff is running about billion billion per quarter brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp of just natural paydowns in those mortgages indiscernible matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it okay thats helpful thank you operator well take our last question today from saul martinez with ubs please go ahead your line is open saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning guys so forgive me for beating a dead horse on the efficiency ratio question but i guess ill ask it in a slightly different way i mean you guys are out what even with gwim being a big part of the overall mix revenue mix but if we assume that revenue growth gets back to say gdp growth over time is there any reason why you couldnt reduce your efficiency ratio below say the midpercent range into the low bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2020 given some of the opportunities you talked about brian and just secular trends towards digitization electronification of payments which obviously reduce unit cost pretty materially it doesnt seem like theres an obvious reason why you couldnt continue to drive that down pretty materially even from here brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp thats what were doing if we keep the expenses flat indiscernible revenue grows gdp plus thats basis points of operating leverage and that will keep reducing efficiency ratio by definition so youre stating what our job is and weve been able to do it and well continue to saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay so theres no obvious is there any point at which or any obvious point at which it becomes just much more difficult or is the glide path from here is just seems like theres nothing really to prevent you from doing that for a while brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well let you know when we think we cant do it anymore but we dont see it so saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it all right thanks a lot operator we have no further questions at this time it is now my pleasure to turn the call back to brian moynihan for any closing remarks brian t moynihan chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well thank all of you for your attention on the call we finished another strong year in for the team and they did a great job growing the earnings and doing it the right way making the investments across the franchise as we say its a nice start well continue to focus on responsible growth weve got a lot of room to run in this company every business had good client activity the loan deposit underlying customer growth at the size and scale of this institution are tremendous work by our teammates and all that helped us provide stable performance with the rate cut that came through relatively late in the year so we feel good about that and we feel good about working through the other side as paul described earlier we are focused on the cost as many of you asked about but were focused on continuing to develop and implement products and services which meet the markets needs and continue to help us grow our market share across every business at the rate were doing it which we think is an opportunity which is ours to continue to take thank you operator
