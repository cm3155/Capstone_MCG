you brian thanks bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 brian t moynihan chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp thank you lee and thank all of you for joining us for our results as i step back and thought about talking to you this quarter i thought back to our discussion of last quarters results in midapril as we were talking we sat in the depths of the covid19 crisis were seeing a rise in virus cases we completed a massive move in our company and companies around the world to work from home we were closing branches for safety and other facilities we had million customers that had already approached us by midapril asking for assistance in terms of paying their loans wed seen a massive amount of commercial line draws in midmarch to midapril and loan requests out of panic and the need to create instant liquidity and we saw a flood of deposits looking for safe havens at the same time yet at that time the core economic projections were still catching up to the worsening predictions of the future and the reality of the health officials projections of the virus path and the reality of shutdown and stayathome orders and now were a quarter later in some areas the cases are still rising and some areas are rising less economic predictions have been revised and the forward path has deteriorated from last quarter baseline projections now extend the length of the recessionary environment into deep into we provide substantial additional reserves for expected future credit losses this quarter to reflect that and has impacted our earnings on the other hand theres been some encouraging signs consumer spending activity has vastly improved since april spending by bank of america consumers during was a total of trillion so its a sizable sample of us activity for the month of april that spending was down compared to april of however for the month of june that spending was relatively flat to and so far through the first couple weeks of july were seeing that total spending actually be above what it was last year customers and businesses have adapted to a new environment some have reopened and yes some have also been reclosed or limited again we expect this startstop to be the base case as we look ahead at present core operating assumptions for making our credit projections and our reserving by the unemployment stays elevated and ends this year around and it remains at in the first half of and at the end of in that provision setting scenario mix it takes some time until late or early for the aggregate gdp level to get to the same size it was heading into so itll be a bit of work to get back to that level the central banks around the world led by actions of the fed provide unprecedented liquidity in the financial system the us government has also provided direct payments through unemployment supplements eip the ppp program and many other things to help american citizens weather the storm due to all that a number of things are in fact different from our last quarter conversation panic borrowing has dissipated as the markets are providing a financing source for many companies to extend their maturities most companies have stabilized their operations draw rates at middle market lines of credit are back to levels they were mid last year in the smaller business segment theyre actually down as companies do not need the liquidity while many companies may not like where they are in terms of revenue growth they have stabilized consumers have benefited from direct stimulus and deferrals on loan payments from banks such delinquencies are far lower than would be predicted in an unemployment scenario consumers have more money in their accounts for those that received the ppp the small businesses that received it at bank of america we estimate that the money has been spent out of the ppp proceeds at only level so far so 65s left to be distributed from those companies to their employees and other vendors coronavirus assistance requests have bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 fallen the consumers what we call cap program the weekly requests for the last three weeks are down from where they were in midapril the question we all get asked then is when will the storm end that is and has always been a healthcare question not an economic one so our job continues to be prepared for whatever the economic scenario ahead brings and how do you get prepared well its too late to start in the second quarter we did that through our adamant team decadelong effort to drive responsible growth in our company portfolios are in great shape heading into this year and in the second quarter we reviewed our commercial loan portfolios at a customer level across our businesses our risk ratings are uptodate were moving credits quickly to criticized or npl designations weve also gone through every credit to assess the needs that theyll have to borrow in the nearterm for liquidity and business prospects on our consumer books weve also benefit from the decadelong improvement in our underwriting standards we remain consistent since the virus and rising unemploymentrelated matters we pared our consumer risk appetite a key difference in our company now versus the last crisis is the unsecured card portfolio its basically half of what it was going into the great recession and with better asset quality another example of difference is commercial real estate far less exposure especially in the construction area we saw a recent stress test prove this out again as we had the lowest losses among the large firms for the seventh out of the past eight stress tests the fed has run weve also improved our fortress balance sheet even from yearend to today all this amidst this crisis we have built liquidity our liquidity at the end of the quarter was up billion on average it is significantly up from year end weve doubled our credit reserves to billion from where they stood at yearend weve built our capital levels resulting in a common equity tier ratio at the end of the quarter of versus at yearend and were basis points above our regulatory minimum and as we disclosed to you after the stress test we have room even within the stress capital buffer as we were floored at level despite the actual calculation we earned billion yeartodate even as we built those reserves and we returned billion of capital to you in the first half by the way chargeoffs in the quarter were stable and the ratio remained low at basis points this quarter and our npl has only increased modestly in this environment despite scouring the portfolio for rating changes quarterly expenses of billion remain in a tight fouryear longrange of billion to billion with little exception even as we continue our investments over the period and incur higher covid operating expenses during the crisis we also havent lost our way on the strategic programs during the first half we have driven our promise as a digital leader across all our businesses our capabilities enabled smooth transitions for our companies and our institutional investors and our people who we work with as customers whether theyre working from home or sheltering in place to transact their financial business whatever way they want to where this goes we will see our raw data has provided some signs of cautious optimism we emphasize cautious here we arent in the ph reestimate state here we are being diligent and were making sure we keep our company strong in any regard we are ready for whatever happens because of the last decade of hard work on responsible growth most importantly were ready because we have talented teammates who work with me every day that come and do a great job for the customers communities and our shareholders bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 so lets drop into quarter two results were going to do slide and slide together and id ask you to refer to that combination the commentary on talks about the charts on slide this quarter we showed the balance in our company while more creditsensitive businesses saw low earnings due to provisions and lower rates impacted our fastgrowing deposit types of businesses our position as a top capital markets platform for issuers and institutional investors allows us to produce solid overall results markets served as an anchor to windward for the company in the second quarter we produced billion of net income this concluded building our loan loss reserve by billion to a total provision expense of billion earnings were per share earnings are down billion from the second quarter of last year driven primarily by our reserve build as i did last quarter i think its useful to draw your attention to the pretax preprovision income number we believe that number helps assess the earnings power of the company to support credit costs in the downturn we produced billion of pretax preprovision income which was down from quarter two given the changes in interest rates and the growth of deposits and the impact it has on our company the forgiveness in fees weve made to help accommodate our consumer customers in time of stress and the overall lower economic activity at record drops in this quarter it shows pretty remarkable resilience in fact its just below the average of pretax preprovision income to the levels of the past four quarters the yearoveryear decline in revenue was driven by lower nii nii fell to billion this quarter bearing the brunt of the significant first quarter rate cuts for the entire quarter mitigating the revenue decline from nii was strong global markets results sales and trading revenues excluding dva of billion were up year overyear investment banking fees of billion were a record and grew yearonyear in aggregate we saw billion improvement in sales and trading and investment banking yearoveryear most importantly and we think about profit in this company our global markets team produced billion in aftertax profit as a separate segment our noninterest expense was billion as i said earlier and this included roughly million in net impact of expenses and savings related to covid19 our return on tangible common equity was lets go to slide here we note the continuation and expansion of the programs to support our teammates and clients initiated last quarter in quarter one we established broad measures to promote the health and safety of our teammates and help limit their exposure to covid in quarter two we continued and expanded those efforts and have remained mostly in the workfromhome posture with less than of our employees in offices financial centers or call centers around the world we continue to provide ongoing access to comprehensive benefits and resources such as enhanced backup childcare and adult care services among the many other supplements and incentives for frontline associates and all those costs are in the numbers youre seeing this quarter and we honor our commitments to hire the students for summer jobs and permanent jobs coming out of college taking care of employees is the right thing to do and enables each of them to play the important role they must as providers of critical services for the us economy and the worldwide economy in addition to keeping our financial centers open to serve clients continuously through the crisis we continue to offer assistance in our commercial consumer and small business clients affected by covid these actions include payment deferrals refund of certain consumer fees pausing certain foreclosure sales repossessions of cars evictions and other matters one noteworthy path was the ppp the paycheck protection program we bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 originated the largest number of loans in that program with 334000plus small business clients receiving a loan providing funding of billion we also supported the communities we live in after announcement in quarter one to donate million to fight the immediate effects of the pandemic we announced a new initiative in quarter two we recognized there are communities and certain people that have been disproportionately impacted by this health care crisis and the elevated racial tensions that existed for years in this country we announced a billion fouryear commitment to advance issues of racial equality economic opportunity and health care initiatives our market presence and other leaders throughout the country are busy working to play their vital role in helping us plan how we deploy those critical funds to these critical actions im proud of how my teammates serve the customers and clients during this covid crisis but im even prouder how theyre playing a part more generally to help on page we discuss the deferrals the assistance program the customer assistance program as we call it cap for our clients to provide easy access to request loan deferrals and ease their immediate financial burdens requests built quickly peaking in the first week of april at requests in a single work they started dropping from that point and have continued to drop by midmay the requests fell and the last three weeks weve been consistently below that peak in total we processed million consumer deferrals with about million of those remaining as we enter july this represents billion of consumer balance with payments on deferral the largest numbers of process deferrals as you can see are credit cardholders another area of the concentrated requests is the practice solutions groups and small business let me provide a little deeper insight into these categories you can see it on the lower righthand part of the slide on credit card of deferrals were initiated late march early april and has died down since then that initiated were current on their payments when the deferral was requested more than of the active card deferrals have made at least one payment since going on deferral onethird have made every payment every month as we look forward if there are no other major changes in consumer spending habits or major macro deterioration wed expect card deferrals to decline significantly in quarter three given the expiration and these payment observations importantly our credit reserving you see in our pl today reflects the individual credit characteristics of all these deferred borrowers and the higher risk they propose small business is where we saw the highest percentage of accounts requesting assistance as you may recall last quarter where we talked about this these requests came from our business practice solutions group these are mostly dentists and doctors who were shut down during the crisis but now are open as they reopen our internal survey shows that of these borrowers as of a few weeks ago were all back to work with steady revenue in our contacts with the accounts indicated no elevated level of continued distress and informed us theyll need not to continue their deferral and while not in this chart our deferrals for commercial accounts amounted roughly of our loans but only of those are unsecured and through conversations with these borrowers wed not expect many of these to request a second deferral now moving on to slide for consumer spending after a significant slowdown in consumer spending in april we began to see signs of improvement beginning in may and while still early we have seen momentum in early july chart on slide shows a sevenday moving average of payments and compares after the same week last year bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 there are three lines representing credit debit and total spending again credit is about debits about the same amount and total spending is obviously the trillion i talked about before overall in the first couple of months of the year in a healthier us economy payments were running as high single digit percentage pace ahead of the same period in that changed as the pandemic spread and the economy shutdown we saw a severe decline across all payment types particularly in discretionary spending on categories like travel leisure and entertainment which drives credit card spending to lower levels than other forms of payment including debit card this was followed by a large increase in payments for necessities around groceries and staples like health supplies as you can see those payments were made largely with debit cards or cash as states began to reopen over the past couple of months we saw an improvement in spending levels as customers became more active buying fuel and spending on home projects and eating out much of that improvement has been paid through debit usage as customers saw stimulus payments and other assistance in their checking accounts on a monthly basis comparing spending to the prioryears month april was down from april may was down from may and as i said earlier june returned to basically flat we have seen some spending leveling off on a weekly basis as covid cases rose recently in hotspots around the country causing municipalities or states to pause further on further phases of reopening or impose more restrictions but even with that july is actually running ahead of last year and is much higher during the shutdown periods of early april and may it appears consumers are demonstrating theyre quickly adapting to the environment by changing shopping habits and moving back and forth between physical and online as needed and are doing the same with delivery and takeout restaurants as restrictions change we continue to monitor this behavior every day and expect that therell be starts and stops as you see the ebbs and flows of cases and governments reactions to them and also until we learn to operate in this new normal let us go to lending activity on slide here we see that the borrowing credit shows modest growth beyond the commercial activity involving loans and paydowns weve seen some modest recovery in some consumer loan applications which all troughed in april as you can see during the quarter total loans declined billion from the end of quarter one but theres several dynamics worth mentioning including the sale of billion of mortgage loans within commercial excluding ppp activity loans grew billion yeartodate as clients paid down billion of the billion loan growth in quarter one while this isnt good for the balance sheet and loan growth it is a good sign as many borrowers in quarter one accessed emergency or panic borrowing to get liquidity but has since paid those funds back or theyve accessed the capital markets and termed out the financing many of which we were able to assist in helping them do as i said earlier revolver usage has returned to levels in our middle market business about where it was last year and its lower than those levels in our business banking business consumer lending show solid residential mortgage growth but a decline in credit card during the spending levels i described earlier the point is there are a lot of covidrelated activity but underneath that while soft there were some underlying demands for loans in the first half of the year mortgage apps continued to be solid despite conservative price in credit at bank of america weve also seen auto loan apps fight their way back to the levels they were precrisis as dealers have opened and people have bought cars bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 and last i would note that we continue to supply capital to these customers our total commitments have been consistent to our commercial customers and theyve remained above trillion throughout all these periods and yeartodate weve approved nearly billion in new and expanded commercial commitments for our customers to help them weather this storm on deposits we talk about those on slide weve seen impressive client activity and that activity has continued during the quarter across every single line of business since the end of total deposits have risen billion to more than trillion its also worth noting that the disciplined pricing or rates paid moved from basis points paid to the customer to basis points as short rates declined consumer deposits grew billion or of that growth has been in checking further cementing our position as a leading core transactional bank for american consumers global banking deposits have risen billion or our wealth management deposits are up billion or customers continue to value our company as of course a partner importantly and on slide well talk about this its the last thing ill mention before i turn it over to paul to go more in depth through the numbers is our clients digital usage our customers value the years of continuous investment in innovation as they found an everincreasing need for our digital capabilities in the covid environment providing this proves once again that we are a digital bank and a physical bank in consumer there are many examples and ill touch on a few digital logins were billion logins in the quarter and have increased in the past months the average logins per user is also up demonstrating engagement in quantity of users and depth of use by those users more customers discovered these convenience and safety of opening accounts digitally as the number of units sold digitally increased since last year representing of sales we added over million new mobile check deposit users with a surprising of those being baby boomers or seniors who have been traditionally harder to engage digitally this engagement effort of keeping our physical centers and call centers running have our customer satisfaction running at alltimes high at bank of america on the commercial side weve seen an equally impressive growth in our users and usage as commercial users have the need for similar conveniences while theyre in a workfromhome mode and wealth management in addition to convenient online banking capability and increased engagement we utilize webex and other methods to have secure video conference applications to engage with our clients which result in household growth in our wealth management business even during the crisis digital logins across merrill clients were up more than yearoveryear and of checks deposited were digitally versus less than last year if you look on slide this looks at the more active consumer segment a lot of you focus on singlepurpose payment providers i want to draw your attention to the top right chart for zelle to illuminate how much money is moving through our customers through that system we now have million customers actively using zelle every month adding million in just the past months alone and you can see in the chart weve nearly doubled the volume of transactions every year for the past four years to now more than million transactions in the quarter and that volume has resulted in nearly doubling the dollars used to billion in transfers during this quarter thats impressive gains given the fact that total payment volumes have dropped and zelle is free to our industrys clients and benefits our shareholders through lower costs above all its better for our customers and with that let me turn it over to paul bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 paul m donofrio chief financial officer bank of america corp thank you brian im going to start on slide with the balance sheet our balance sheet ended the quarter at trillion in total assets increasing billion since the end of  driven by a surge in deposits during  deposits grew by billion while loans declined by billion as commercial borrowers repaid much of their lines excess liquidity continued to be invested predominantly in cash and cash equivalents shareholders equity increased modestly as earnings exceeded distributions to shareholders with respect to regulatory ratios for the past two years our cet1 ratio under the standardized approach has been binding but this quarter the ratio under the advanced approach is lower and therefore binding our cet1 ratio under the standardized approach improved basis points linked quarter to primarily driven by an billion decline in rwa this rwa decline was mainly driven by commercial loan paydowns as well as lower credit card balances in addition we early adopted the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk aka saccr for derivatives our cet1 ratio under the advanced approach improved to as rwa under advanced declined modestly also this quarter we received our preliminary stress capital buffer or scb from the federal reserve pursuant to our ccar results our stress depletion was approximately basis points and including the dividend addon our scb was a little under however as you know scbs are floored at so our minimum standardized and advanced cet1 requirement is and remained unchanged the capital cushion above our cet1 minimum was billion at quarter end the cet1 ratio under the advanced approach became our binding ratio primarily due to the impact on rwa of the migration of corporate credit risk ratings under the advanced approach our tlac ratios increased and remain comfortably above our minimum requirements turning to slide and net interest income on a gaap nonfte basis nii in  was billion billion on an fte basis net interest income declined billion for both  as well as  as we noted on our  call and experienced this quarter nii fell to roughly billion this quarter as variable rate assets repriced lower following a more than basis point decline in average one month libor from  other notable nii headwinds in the quarter include roughly million of higher premium amortization on our assetbacked securities given the lower rate environment and a decline in higheryielding credit card balances these negative impacts were partially offset by deposit growth coupled with lower deposit pricing the addition of ppp loans in the quarter was marginally it also marginally aided nii as did lower global markets funding costs given the sharp decline in nii coupled with the increase in the balance sheet driven by deposit growth net interest yields declined notably quarteroverquarter by basis points looking at the bottomright chart the largest driver of that decline was lower interest rates quarteroverquarter another large impact was the increase in deposits which is modestly helping nii but diluting net interest yield given that most of the excess funding in  was invested in cash or cash equivalents earning only or basis points we continue to assess uncertainty with respect to the duration of these deposits two other elements diluted net interest yield they are the higher level of premium amortization and the lower balances of high yielding credit cards in terms of forward nii guidance we believe the largest impact from the interest rate declines occurred in  as expected as we enter  we face a headwind from the paydowns of commercial loans which could reduce nii by a couple hundred million dollars and as a reminder nii will be impacted by the long end of the curve as our bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 securities portfolio continues to reprice lower beyond  nii stability absent material changes in the economic conditions will be dependent on asset growth andor redeployment of deposits into higheryielding securities rather than cash beyond nii as brian mentioned the balance and diversity of our revenue streams combined with strong expense management has supported pretax preprovision income despite the unprecedented decline in interest rates i would also just remind you that shortend rates were near zero in and before rates rose in those years we produced solid profits plus today we have billion in higher loan balances and billion in higher deposit balances which will benefit nii versus those periods turning to slide and expenses at billion this quarter expenses were modestly lower than  for three years now despite investments in areas such as technology sales professionals marketing philanthropy new or renovated financial centers expanded benefits and increased minimum wage we have managed expenses well and have operated in a tight range of billion to billion in expense each quarter outside of the impairment charge taken in  this quarter was no exception even with the added costs related to covid19 in  we estimate that covid related spending versus covidrelated savings netted to an increase in expense totaling million we will be working hard to reduce this cost as we move through this crisis while at the same time ensuring that our customers and employees are safe the higher cost of covid was mostly offset by the absence of elevated payroll tax when comparing total noninterest expense to  with respect to expenses beyond  please note that on july we began accounting for merchant services provided directly to our customers versus through a joint venture accordingly beginning in  we will record revenue and expense for these operations separately as opposed to netting them under the equity method of accounting as a result we expect the expense for this business to add roughly million per quarter to our expense run rate additional revenue for merchant services in the near term should be roughly million a quarter improving as the economy recovers and operations become even more fully integrated driving increased value for clients we are excited to integrate merchant services into our lines of business merchant services is an important product for many of our clients from small businesses to large multinationals who rely on accepting credit and debit cards for significant portions of their revenue as such it is core to transactional banking and working capital management because our lobs enjoy leading market share across both consumers and businesses we can innovate connect and provide services that add value across the spectrum of payment users including offering innovations in expedited settlement enhanced authorization leastcost routing liquidity management credit fx data analytics and many other products our new proprietary platform is flexible resilient and enables us to grow and facilitate the evolution of the payment ecosystem as the marketplace evolves turning to asset quality on slide our underwriting standards have been responsible and strong for many years now and we expect this fact to benefit us as we advance through this health crisis one independent indicator of the relative quality of our balance sheet is the federal reserves annual ccar stress test our net chargeoff ratio under this years stress test was once again the lowest of our peers and has been the lowest in seven of the last eight years total net chargeoffs this quarter were billion or basis points of average loans net chargeoffs rose million from  with an uptick in commercial losses mostly offset by lower consumer losses bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 provision expense was billion our reserve build of billion reflects a weaker economic outlook since the end of  which impacted expected future losses while we saw increases in commercial reservable criticized exposures impacted by the virus overall credit thus far has been better than expected as npls only rose modestly versus our expectations as the economy reopened we saw lower deferral requests better payment trends from distressed borrowers a slower pace of commercial downgrades towards the end of the quarter and faster payments of line draws than we anticipated on slide we break out our credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios on the consumer front covid effects on asset quality remain benign this is driven by deferrals extended to consumer borrowers coupled with government stimulus for individuals and small businesses consumer net chargeoffs declined million which is partially attributable to a deferral which should provide a better chance of recovery with stimulus and other assistance in commercial we saw million increase in net chargeoffs with concentration in commercial real estate and energy our commercial loan book excluding small business ended the quarter at investmentgrade or collateralized one could see covids impact more clearly in reservable criticized exposures which increased billion from  this increase was driven not surprisingly by exposures to cruise lines restaurants real estate and retailing turning to slide this table provides a full picture of our allowance build since yearend as you can see our allowance including reserves for unfunded commitments was billion at yearend and has doubled to more than billion while our overall loan balances are relatively flat note that we ended  with an allowance to loans and leases of i would also note the covered ratio for credit card increased to total commercial loans increased to and cre rose to these ratios reflect our loan mix with consumer concentrated in secured loans with consistent high underwriting standards which for the past years has focused on high fico borrowers with whom we have strong relationships it also reflects the investmentgrade nature of our commercial portfolio with strong payment and debt service characteristics our increase in reserve from  reflect an outlook based upon the most recent economic consensus estimates in addition we continued to include downside scenarios a weighting of these new scenarios produced a recessionary outlook with a deeper decline and gap to return to positive gdp it is worth noting that if one looks at the feds stress credit losses in the latest ccar and just assumes that we have pushed all those losses into reserves today our cet1 ratio would still be above versus our minimum of obviously there remain many unknowns including how government fiscal and monetary actions will impact the outcome and how our own deferral programs will impact losses but perhaps the biggest uncertainty is how long economic activity and conditions will be significantly impacted by the virus okay turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on slide despite the enormous financial challenges of various covidrelated impacts including dramatically lower rates fee reductions higher provisions and increased expense the business remained profitable in the quarter and as brian discussed this health crisis has proven the value of our high tech and hightech strategy the significant investments and innovation in our digital capabilities have been a valuable resource for our customers complementing investments in our financial centers and differentiating us from peers provision expense reflected higher expected future losses from the worsened economic conditions and note that net chargeoffs in the period actually declined so much of the financial burden of expected future losses were incurred in the first half of this year and because of deferrals significant chargeoffs in this segment are not likely until the end of this year or later bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 revenue in this business absorbed the brunt of the companys nii decline as the segment has the bulk of our deposits and this segment also bore the brunt of the fee waivers negatively impacting revenue card fees were down as a result of lower spending activity as well as fee waivers service charges were down as well due to fee waivers and fewer overdraft and related fees as a result of increased balances in customers accounts with respect to expenses as you know banking is considered an essential service and across the country we have managed to keep of our financial centers open the team worked through enormous challenges in the first half of the year to assure ongoing service which has been a daily balance between the service our customers need and the safety of our employees as well as customers our costs reflect this balancing act weve added roles to service calls and manage digital interactions not only for existing products and services but also for small business applications to the paycheck protection program many of these additional personnel work from home we also continued to invest in the franchise we added salespeople in addition to the associates to handle customer calls that i just mentioned we renovated and added financial centers and we increased minimum wages the expense from these investments continued to be mitigated at least in part by process improvements digitalization and technology improvements client momentum continued as we saw average deposits rise billion or from  even more impressive was the fact that of this growth was in checking accounts as clients received stimulus delayed their tax payments and slowly are ramping up spending average loans increased driven by mortgage demand in this lowrate environment mortgage growth was mitigated by a decline in credit card and other consumer balances we continued to add consumer investment accounts and see strong flows into our merrill edge platform in  we added more customer investment accounts this year than last year with more than of those added digitally aum rose driven by flows and market valuation lets skip slide and move to wealth management as i think weve covered most of the trends already so referring to wealth management to global wealth investment management on slide and here again you saw lower rates as covidrelated credit costs impact an otherwise solid quarter with good aum flows as well as strong deposits and loan growth merrill lynch and the private bank both continued to grow clients as we remained a provider of choice for affluent clients despite our sales force working from home in  we added nearly net new households in merrill lynch and nearly net new relationships in the private bank total client balances rose to trillion from  driven by the rebound in equity markets compared to a year ago they are up driven by strong growth in deposits aum flows and loans net income of million was down driven by a decline in revenue as well as higher provision expense the revenue decline was driven equally by lower nii as well as fees noninterest income decreased driven by lower transactional revenues and lower asset management fees driven by market valuations partially offset by the benefit of aum flows expenses were stable yearoveryear as investments made in the past months in sales professionals and technology were offset by lower revenuerelated incentives and net savings associated with covid provision expense increased from reserves built for future covidrelated net charge offs while current net chargeoffs remained low moving to global banking on slides and as noted earlier global banking saw a strong average loan growth from  line draws record deposit levels and record investment banking fees but those benefits were not enough to offset the impact of lower rates and higher provision expense as a result of covid the business bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 earned million falling billion from  but this included adding billion to the allowance for credit losses this quarter on a pretax preprovision basis results improved yearoveryear driven by record investment banking results in  we were able to improve notably both our investment banking revenue and market share for the second straight quarter investment banking fees of billion were up yearoveryear this record result included records in both investmentgrade as well as equity capital markets while average loans were up from  i would note that repayment of  draws built significantly as the quarter progressed which will be a headwind to nii in  i would also note that new loan originations spreads increased quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear at the same time we continued to see strong growth in deposits which were up billion or even as the rate paid declined following the decline in libor rates rates paid are now back to levels seen at the end of just before rates began to rise growth in investment banking fees loans and deposits reflect not only what we believe to be a flight to quality but also the addition of hundreds of bankers over the past few years increasing and improving our client coverage turning to digital on slide as we have already covered most of the important points around loan and deposit activity on as in consumer and gwim our digital capabilities are more important and useful than ever in this health crisis enabling clients to work from home and seamlessly manage their treasury needs and its no surprise that in this environment we would continue to see increased use of these capabilities switching to global markets on slide our teams performed well in an unusual environment producing the best quarter of revenue since the first quarter of we saw the fixed income market mostly strengthen through the quarter and prices recover from  with particular strength in credit products as i usually do i will talk about results excluding dva this quarter net dva was a loss of million global markets produced billion of earnings in  nearly doubling the prioryears period and increased from solid  results yearoveryear revenue was up from higher sales and trading results and improved investment banking fees partially offset by the absence of a gain on an equity investment which occurred in  expenses were wellcontrolled and flat compared to  within revenue sales and trading improved yearoveryear driven by a improvement in ficc and a sic improvement in equities compared to  sales and trading revenue also improved as growth in ficc linked quarter overcame a decline in equities from a record in  trading comparisons to  for ficc reflected better trading performance across all products both macro and credit ficc results benefited from improved client flows credit spread tightening lower funding costs and asset prices which rallied through the quarter equity revenue was driven by stronger performance in cash and client financing partially offset by a weaker performance in derivatives on slide note the halfyear comparisons which shows sales and trading up yearoveryear but otherwise pretty stable over the past several years at around billion finally on slide we show all other which reported a profit of million revenue benefited from a gain of million from the sale of billion in mortgage loans which drove the improvement in revenue from  our effective tax rate this quarter was reflecting the tax rate expected for the rest of due to the greater impact of tax credits related to taxadvantaged investments on lower pretax income as well as the related adjustment to the yeartodate tax rate bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 okay with that lets open it up for questions question and answer section

net interest income comments of down a couple hundred million im assuming that is off the current base and then do we stabilize from there i heard your comments about depending on how we assess the duration of and stickiness of the deposits so maybe you could talk about how do assess the it sounds good but i dont know how you if clients can help you assess that but how do you assess the duration and stickiness of the deposits and what would you redeploy into if you thought that they were somewhat sticky paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so just to be clear were talking about a couple hundred million off of from  to  i wont repeat all the kind of drivers of that beyond  the growth of nii is going to be dependent upon sort of asset growth and redeployment of deposits into higheryielding securities weve added billion in deposits since yearend all of that has gone into cash earning basis points so as we assess the future of this pandemic as we kind of assess how much of that is going to stick around and we get a little bit more confident on those two elements that can be deployed into securities or a portion of it lets say can be deployed into securities and thats theres a big difference even in these rates between what you can earn on a mortgagebacked security or a treasury bond and basis points so theres some opportunity there but it has to i think were going to be thoughtful about it and its one of those things i think you know when you see it glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi got it maybe a similar question on expenses the million in covidrelated expense im assuming thats a combination of ppp and workfromhomerelated things does that roll off starting now does that stick around i want to get to the core number that were adding the million of merchant servicing expenses on top of thanks paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah sure so as we said were sort of estimating that if you take all the increases from covidrelated spending and all the decreases youre at a net million if you think about all those increases its not just ppp theres supplemental pay theres childcare theres masks theres food theres more financial guards at our financial centers youve got all the ppprelated expenses youve got all the tech expenses moving people fortunately all our employees moving to workfromhome youve got some offsets sort of from travel and other bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 employee expenses in terms of meetings that all kind of nets down this quarter to million were going to work on that i dont think you can say its all going to go away in  but were going to work on those expenses as we move forward but of course were going to make sure anything we do were not jeopardizing the safety of our customers and employees so we think theres some opportunity there glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay last one the wealth management reserve build i wonder if you could talk about the profile of those loans how much of that is to things like a building for a wealthy individual that ph vests their corporation just curious on what in wealth management will require that build paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp most of it is mortgages brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp and theres some commercial lending in there but its all very highquality and personal wealthy peoples loans and some of there were of our mortgage originations this quarter indiscernible and so its a significant mortgage book and that picks up some and adjusts the estimates whether it happens or not is a separate question but we feel good about that portfolio but its just the same factors apply to the rest of the portfolio as applied in that business glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay appreciate it thank you brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp but when we look at things like real estate exposure we consider real estate exposure in that business if people have buildings and things were talking about theres going back glenn to the many years theres no hidden sort of real estate exposure in our wealth management business its handled as real estate glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi understood thanks brian operator the next question is from mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp hi mike bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey brian you mentioned july activity is above last year is that right so just a little bit more color on the green shoots seems like the trends are all in your favor but im just wondering if thats backwardlooking in many of your markets like florida or texas or california i mean thats where youre big youre seeing an increase in covid cases and i guess that leads to deaths and that leads to shutdowns so from an ontheground perspective do you expect these green shoots to continue what advice do you give the governors in those states how does it all shake out brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp the first advice we give to everybody is try to be safe the faster you can get the environment to tip over as youve seen in some of the hotspots we talked about last april you can see the activity pick up but just to be very precise the data through the 14th of july so thats about as recent as you might be able to get is up over last year if you look in the first two weeks of july it fell a little bit in texas and places like that but its still higher as an aggregate than where they were in the shutdown phase so itll plateau a little bit mike i think and youll see that ebb and flow but there are other activities that just overwhelm that what you see in terms of the bars closing and stuff just the general activities the improvement in peoples homes spending on their homes and you saw some of the data today that supports that in the retail sales numbers so yes its flattened a little bit because it flattened in credit card youll see that more dramatically because of the credit card spending that goes on in restaurants and travel and stuff but just in the last couple of weeks it fell midsingle digit percentages i think in some of those in texas and florida but its still comparing that week to the weeks before the reopening thats up so well see it play out its hard to be any more downto date than july mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then a separate question i guess youve added more to your reserve what billion added to your reserves the last two quarters another billion this quarter pretty remarkable and your net chargeoff ratio is flat quartertoquarter talk about a disconnect however maybe its not a disconnect so i guess its a tough question but what would your chargeoffs be what would your npas be if you didnt have the forbearance in place like if it ended tomorrow and you had to recognize the full extent of the problems just a sense of order of magnitude would it be higher higher higher what brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp just to give you a simple answer if you and a little bit of this mike will always depend on timing because think about credit cards and theres a roll rate to them as you well know but just for the second quarter i think the number would have been another million higher if you took all the stuff and assume the payment behavior took place but there was no deferral and so thats million on what million million so its something small interestingly enough for the nondeferred customers the delinquency quartertoquarter actually went down or basis points for the nondeferred customer excuse me the nondeferred customers the of people in card that didnt defer their delinquency went down quartertoquarter and so as you think about that its a mixed bag bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 the other thing thats inherent in your question is all of us getting used to cecl versus the old methods of providing which is you provide for lifetime and then the losses are going to come later down the road by definition or else you have it as a cecl provision so but youll see the actual losses come in in later quarters but youre right right now we are seeing nothing that is consistent with an unemployment rate in the actual consumer payment behavior and that has to do with the stimulus and things that its helping the margins quite substantially so its hard to predict because theres a lot of factors in it but thats kind of the data points id give you to give you a sense of it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and just last followup i mean clearly the stock market based on your stock price doesnt believe you they think your customers are a lot weaker are we just not seeing it yet i mean two or three quarters from now where you say ah it was a lot worse than we expected or do you think this is going to play out in that like actually the borrowers are in better shape than people realize brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp i think part of this will play out in terms of how the path forward on phase stimulus and everything occurs but even on the commercial side if you look the npls went up million or something on the commercial npls for the quarter basis points so even on the commercial side we went through and we asked our team to go through every commercial borrower in our business banking our middlemarket segment which is tens of thousands of borrowers and assess every one of them rerate them make sure theyre all uptodate make sure they just really go work on it when theyre at home and not able to do as much and theyve gone through that book and what you see criticized move up and thats expected the actual nonperformers arent and so those commercial customers are adapting and youre seeing it so i think if we basically look at the assessment the provision setting methodology is as we said unemployment yearend first half of next year gets down to so its not a rosy picture in a lot of ways and the proof is we give all this data to the fed as paul said and they do a stress test and under those scenarios our losses run i dont know and were stuck with reserves today and were not in that scenario in terms of actual payment behavior by customers or delinquencies or in cash and that has to do with the stimulus its different in this crisis than its ever been it was given directly to consumers to sustain their ability to perhaps carry their daytoday expenses mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp hey mike its obviously hard to see data yet right but there are some clues out there and you can start looking at those clues across the industry and you mentioned one of them lets just look at losses you can look at npl growth you can look at reserve crit growth and then as brian just said i mean its not like this is one time where our loss ratios in the feds stress test have been the lowest among peers theyve done eight exams every one of those exams is kind of different they did this thing in that one and stressed this thing more in that other one and changed something else in the next one seven out of eight of them no matter what they changed no matter what they did we have the lowest loss rates so there is some evidence out there if you look carefully at it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thanks again operator next question is from jim mitchell with seaport global please go ahead james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning hey brian just a followup on your corporate credit comment if you look at your npls you absolutely had the least amount of increase quarteroverquarter versus your peers and appreciate your comments that you did really a micro as opposed to macro look at every individual loans so when we think about that do you think its your performance has more to do with the fact that you took a micro look rather than some peers maybe doing a macro look or is it really just your higher exposure to investmentgrade your industry mix and how do you think about the massive amount of capital raising in the second quarter and the liquidity that provides to corporate borrowers and how you factor that in just thats it thanks brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp im not sure where it is in that sequence but its the latter of it which is that basically its the quality of portfolio so our commercial real estate exposure as paul said earlier is much its not going into last crisis we had billion or something of constructionrelated for housing we had like million or something like that very little so theyre kinds of exposure that gets pulled on pretty quickly and remember we took a lot of chargeoffs in the first quarter for gas company exposure couple hundred million paul and those so weve been taking care of the portfolio so its not a macro or micro its actually just the quality of what we have done in client selection across the last decade gets us there and so thats why you see differences in the rates and the stress test and other things but thats responsible growth and weve built this company said wed be adamantine in all times a fortress and thats how we build it and well see where this all goes but remember that our scb is under the floor theres a lot of objective thirdparty evidence that shows and that has a lot to do with our mix of businesses and how we build them james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 yeah absolutely and then maybe on deposit growth it continues to be i think surprisingly strong appreciate the comments of not sure how it holds up and youre holding it in in cash for now but when you think about is there any kind of trends throughout the quarter as the stimulus money got paid do you see deposit growth slowing or youre seeing it turn negative lately how do we think about the ability for those at least nearterm what are you seeing in terms of deposits over the last month brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well and ill let paul talk about this in the commercial side especially because he used to run that business for us a long time ago before we got him to be a cfo but the reality is this the place were uncertain is in the large cash inflows from corporate customers that youre not sure when theyre going to start using the money and redeploy the money and you want them to frankly we should want them to redeploy that money into the economy as opposed to having drawn or raise money in the markets and have it sitting on a balance sheet so thats the real volatility question is when do they when do those companies move some money out for higher yields because some of the money markets rates are settling in with a little more yield to them and things like that and the stability allows them to think about putting them off the bank balance sheet so thats the volatility question in terms of deposits its around that when we look at consumer just to give you a sense the linkedquarter growth in consumer checking was billion we had net new checking accounts yearoveryear up were almost those are numbers that are normal quarter sort of net production i think we might have been or something like that in a quarter like this and so whats happened is we still are building up that core consumer base and the average amount in accounts are up some of thats been spent down we think all of the eiptype stimulus is largely out of peoples accounts its been gone through the system obviously the unemployment supplements for the limited number of customers we have thats a small in any group thats of the population so its smaller than the whole but youre seeing that stimulus that 1200type stimulus came and went out of peoples accounts pretty much on the small business youre seeing the ppp theres to be spent which is also good because thats future stimulus to be deployed and so if you think about all those pieces i would focus more on pauls comments about understanding whether these deposits are going to stick is more of a commercial question and a large corporate question than it is a wealth management consumer question because whats going on behind this is weve ground out another even with half of our branches shut down due to the environment we have ground out digital sales and digital growth and even nondigital growth to the tune of new core checking accounts with average balance moving up at core and thats stick your ribs money and well deploy that over time but you have to make sure that like all of you are worried about where we go next and thats why were trying to keep liquidity positions that might run out of here for the clients purposes or whatever so paul i think all the volatility comments are really around the institutional side of that paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah im not sure i have anything brian maybe just a macro point of obviously if the money supply grows more of our deposit balance is going to go up and when you look at in addition when you look at the treasurys bank account at the fed its got an enormous balance way higher than usual and my guess is some of thats going to end up in the private sector as well so there are some perhaps some macro forces that would suggest that deposit balances are going to grow at banks and were going to get our fair share there are a couple of little just tiny things about the third quarter thats worth reminding people tax payments were delayed and theyre going to get paid in the third quarter plus were all hoping as brian says that spending continues to increase bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 and so some of that excess money thats sitting in peoples accounts may get spent both from the corporate and consumer side and then in gwim youve just got a lot of deposits came out of the market and went into deposit accounts and if markets continue to feel good to people youd expect to see some of that come out of deposits and go back into the market james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc all right well thats all really helpful thanks operator our next questions from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning couple of followups there one on the point you were making about the deposits its interesting that you had all those drawdowns and paybacks but the deposits didnt leave yet thats basically what youre referring to right brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yes betsy thats the interesting point youd expect if they paid them back you would have seen it but other cash came into those companies and it came on the books and i think we grabbed more than our fair share nothing to do with the consumer side but on the institutional side its been interesting as our prediction would have been that wed have seen the deposits decline already and they havent betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah so my two questions ones on just on the forbearance and the waivers can you give us an update as to how youre dealing with those do they roll off automatically are you going person by person how should i be modeling this fee waiver fading is it going to come back do you kick it back in and do you stop the fee waivers in or is it going to be more of a phasein through just help us understand how youre dealing with it brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp i think ph leave aside mortgage has different aspects because of statutes and stuff the rest of the lending side stuff begins especially like the small business as i said earlier really runs off as we speak and then some of the other products run through were always going to help consumers in distress so somebody calls up and says im unemployed and i cant work and stuff were going to work with them and were going to work both on the fee side and on the collection side for lack of a better term but our view from the start was we want to have that dialogue with the consumer to help figure out where they stand and so that activity starts to pick up the waivers by definition were days and they roll off but what youll get away from is people who did it out of panic which when you see somebody whos paid every month obviously they didnt need the waiver those people roll off and disappear and you get down to the people that you need to actually help that are unemployed and struggling and well help them well work with them like we always do on our collection efforts so thats the sort of credit side of things and the big numbers will move the number of requests i said have dropped so its really nothing if you look at our percentages relative to industry mortgage were lower across the board basis points basis points in terms of requests and stuff so we feel good about that bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 when you get to the fees this is really going to come down to this we went into this thinking about it as a bit of a natural disaster type approach betsy so thats going to come down to where the consumer lives the market the condition whats going on in that market and whether theyre able to work and things like that so well see that play out if theres another round of stimulus payments we waive the fees so people wouldnt have the fees weve held off on the fees that they have that could have been negative in their account to make sure they got the whole in the case of the last payment we will do that again because thats the right thing to do to make sure they get the benefits of those payments but those things will sort of ease through the third quarter depending on really a specific question and then as you get towards next year theyll normalize betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then as we go through this pandemic obviously weve got flashpoints building again in certain locations like you were asked earlier on the call youve got a big footprint of branches in these locations so i would think that your programs are open obviously for folks who are coming back into that second wave just want to confirm that and then how are you thinking about the branch footprint just generally i mean you mentioned earlier about opportunities to improve efficiencies to claw back the million net covid cost increase that you experienced this quarter but a little bit longerterm given the increase in digital the fast ramp that weve seen in the most recent couple of months does that make you think hey we can pull back on our branches even more than we had been thinking before give us an update there thanks brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah i think the time to figure that out will be a little bit later betsy not because we dont work on it all the time so even yearoveryear i think were down or branches or something like that in terms of branch count last year second quarter this year second quarter were always working this dynamic they might be bigger can replace two or three small ones they might be places that we just had too many whatever but well always be working that so to branches continue to work it and were doing that by following customer behavior so if some of these behavior changes stick to the ribs youll see us keep finetuning our system by the way the cost of deposits in other words all of the operating costs in consumer over deposits actually went down yearoveryear again by about basis points or something like that so we continue to manage our overall operating costs down and its not just the branches its all of the call centers and all the things around it so let us play that out i dont think and then by the way remember were deploying and we opened branches in the middle of this thing in places in ohio and stuff we didnt have and so that replaces some of the count but a much different execution than something that may have been left over from years ago so were going to let it play out i dont think it will go one way or the other way dramatically but what will happen is some of the account we believe will be consolidated markets as weve always been doing and deploy the markets where we dont have reach i think on a given day were still getting a half million visits to the branches so it is an important part of what we do and the teammates in those branches have done incredible work being open every day during this crisis despite what was going on in the environment around them so they will always be an incredibly important part which makes us different were a big digital company and were a big physical company and that combination produce superior customer reach and results betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 thanks operator well go next to matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning can you just talk about the small business ppp in terms of the timing of when you think it will be repaid or forgiven and remind us of the accounting there and is that included in your net interest income outlook thanks paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp why dont i start with the accounting so if you look at this quarter theres about a little under million it will be a little more than that next quarter in nii for ppp thats a function of interest rate plus under fas youve got to amortize the fees into nii over the life of the loans in terms of the overall program we did about loans in a few weeks that was quite expensive in terms of all that we had to do to do that well and so i would not expect much if any profitability out of ppp matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay all right and that include the fees that you get if its accelerated from a forbearance i think there was some articles out there that you are going to donate any profits but obviously theres just a focus on the revenue and to your point theres a cost as well so paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah once theres forbearance to the extent we were amortizing those fees into nii once a loan is forgiven then you have to accelerate the remaining fees that havent been amortized so it could be a spike in a quarter or two if we start seeing a lot of forbearance but again as you note we said were going to donate profits but i wouldnt expect a lot of profits out of this program loans in a quarter is probably i dont know i think somebody in consumer told me it was like years of loans in small business this was a massive effort that involved people outside the company in the company to get to do it well matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just separately on the criticized commercial loans its helpful that you do disclose this im not sure everybody does so i appreciate that but how would you think about the loss content on that obviously its a much bigger bucket than say nonperformers or loans that youre watching but how should we kind of think about the risk of loans that are kind of criticized versus say nonperforming or how much might flow into non performing brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah i think that depends on the loan theyre largely secured theyre collateralized what sort of recovery but remember the criticized are the ratings driven is a loss a probability to follow the loss given default and then the collateral structure so thats all built into the reserving methodology that results in a reserve build so its not bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 something that you have to think of separately than npls its just theyre different stages in the process of getting through the system so its really youd have to say if its for example we have a lot of retailers who have gone through bankruptcy over the last several years we havent lost anything because of the method of securing ourself and things like that and thats a business weve had for decades that has done a great job there whereas if its an unsecured line and somebody you have a follow on somebody falls quickly that can be more problematic but just rest assured its all built into the methodology which produces a loss content which produces reserves in the scenarios we use matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator next question is from ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning i had a couple questions on the jv dissolution so i was wondering paul relative to your million fees first of all where is it located where are we going to see it and second of all can you help us give perspective of what it was maybe at its peak and youve mentioned it could get better as the economy improves whats the best metric we can watch of your disclosures to track that progress paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp note a portion of that revenue is going to be in consumer a portion of it is going to be in global banking wed have to think about how to help you see it because it never certainly on a net basis it never was a big number in terms of net profits coming out of that jv we expect that now that we can integrate it do it our way really leverage our customer relationships put our full sales force more directly behind it and innovate we think this is incredibly important to our customers and we can grow it but right now i think we gave you some perspective its about i would expect the revenues there to be about million in the near term but we would expect them to grow as we ramp up and some of our investments start to bear fruit and again i dont know how to answer your question on how you can see it ill have to think about that whether its something appropriate for the supplement or not ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and just in terms of the fees other categories wealth management the asset management part was down was that because of the averaging effect and should that improve given the periodend market levels that we saw paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah you have to remember the aum fees are on a onemonth lag so youre picking up there what happened at the end of the first quarter ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 yeah and lastly just any comments about the investment banking pipeline given the relative strength that we saw in the second quarter thanks paul paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah sure the investment banking had a great great quarter and we know we picked up significant market share weve been picking up significant market share for many quarters now i think all of you sort of recognize that it was a record i think our market share is above at this point and our market share in middlemarket investment banking is also rising given our emphasis there on the bankers we add i think were up to were over there a lot of activity as we help clients raise capital to address their needs you cant really expect we dont know the answer but were already sort of seeing a little bit of a slowdown in activity in the first couple of weeks of this quarter so i dont think you can expect that the third quarter is going to be as robust as the second quarter has been but i will want to emphasize we feel really good about the progress we have made with our clients in terms of market share both for large companies around the world and the middlemarket companies operator thank you well go next to saul martinez please go ahead your lines open saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning guys i wanted to start off on nii whats just a bit of a clarification you said nii would be down couple hundred million quarteronquarter on commercial paydowns you also said that long end rates would also weigh on nii just give us a sense of what the order of magnitude could be in terms of additional nii pressure to the third quarter from longend rates i would assume that the redeployment of cash into securities is something that helps but only over a longer period of time and i know paul in the past youve talked about reinvestment risk and kind of sized up the impact of longend rates on securities cash flows so if you can help us understand the potential impacts on third quarter and how to think about it beyond that paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah look i will say in terms of our million kind of perspective being down quarteroverquarter to were kind of putting all of that stuff in there right saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp youve got loans being potentially down youve got average libor coming down youve got the securities portfolio its kind of all in there securities portfolio about billion billion matures every quarter and reinvestment yields right now are significantly below where the portfolio is so thats just going to slowly dilute over time we can offset some of that if we decide to take some of these deposits that are now sitting in cash and put them into securities we can get a sort of a natural offset but we have to sort of just see how that all plays out bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay i think i may have misunderstood i thought that you meant so the million a couple hundred million is all in not simply from the impact of commercial paydowns but from a number of things i guess i guess i wanted to go back and follow up on matts question on ppp and get a little bit better sense for what the order of magnitude of the impact could be because i mean you have billion of ppp loans and i think its fair to assume that a pretty sizable proportion of those will be forgiven and given the fee rates on those i mean were not talking about small numbers even relative to the size of your nii i mean you get to easily over billion so i guess my first question is why shouldnt we see a pretty significant spike in nii in and as those loans start to get forgiven and the income is recognized and i guess relatedly on the expenses i guess im trying to understand what you mean by youre not going to make a lot of money on that is it just that its sort of in the expense base already and youve got to ratchet up expenses or is it that as revenues are recognized from an accounting standpoint youll donate that accounting revenue away as one of your competitors is doing i guess im trying to understand the order of magnitude timing and geography of the impact because they dont seem to be small to me brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp we announced in april i think it was that wed give away the net profits from this activity theres a lot of internal costs obviously allocation of people we have working on the origination platform of this at the high point the forgiveness what weve got people lined up to work on forgiveness that are already working on it and we open for business in a couple of weeks and then we had we also had to hire third parties to come and do some work and supplement us and so theres a lot of elements so where it shows up in revenue and expense well deal with it but well the revenue youre saying is not insignificant the issue is theres a lot of costs against it some are in the pl and some are going to be in next quarters pl because on the forgiveness side we have these teammates working on it so well reconcile it all for you but the basic commitment was to give away the net profits that was something we committed in april this is not new news saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay but am i thinking about it right in terms of yes go ahead paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp youre not going to see to your point on the revenue youre not going to see it in the revenue until the loans start to get forgiven saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah which we would assume is what fourth quarter first quarter or yeah brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp we dont know when its going to be im not sure about that bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah and by the way in phase four theyre talking about extending and doing more loans and yeah theres a bunch of proposals so a little bit this is hard to predict because if they say you can do loan a and they do another loan or extend it thats even in the last quarter weve gone from weeks to or weeks to weeks and things like that so theres no mystery here we just dont know until we get through what exactly is going to happen because the rules change so much saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah okay all right fair enough i appreciate it operator your next question is from vivek juneja with jpmorgan please go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey brian hey paul a question that i wanted to just clarify the consumer loans that have been deferred im presuming in sort of late june early july you started to see some of those start to get through their deferral periods since deferrals were days and so what are you seeing in the ones where deferrals are done what percentage are reupping and asking for a deferral to continue versus how many are going off and of those going off what are you seeing brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp were not your point vivek is that were sort of its now the time for that it all kind of the time period that most of it occurred is now in a time period where it rolls off and so well know better but you separate the card weve already seen a couple hundred thousand roll off and a bunch of them are rolling off as we speak so that is of them are card and so separate that from the standpoint of all the other aspects what i said earlier about small business which is the biggest percentage category those are docs and dentists and theyve all told us theyre paying us and their payments are now coming up in july and early august in terms of home loans were seeing the numbers on deferral drop every week because the new requests are less than people who continue to pay and so its going to come down to cards and were in that period of time but there are substantial reserves set up based on the credit characteristics of those individual cardholders and what our expected outcome for them are and as we said earlier a lot of them a substantial number have been paying us every month some havent been paying us at all some have been paying us partly and that all play out this quarter when they chargeoff with them well be down as that plays out over the roll rate type of thing but its all in the reserves today in other words theres a decent chunk of reserves in the card business that is specifically built by these deferred loans what i said earlier and if you didnt hear it was that for the second quarter for the people who had deferred the actual increase in chargeoffs would have been about i dont know million million on a basis 600andsome million whatever it is so it wasnt a substantial difference yet and so those are the people that only got enough that they were rolled and charged off during the quarter so let us see it play out its in the reserves it will be covered by the reserves bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks operator our next question is from brian kleinhanzl with kbw please go ahead brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thanks just two quick questions i mean first on the expenses just how should we be thinking about the expense trajectory as we look out to the third quarter fourth quarter i get the extra million from merchant services but then how much of these covidtype expenses are expected to roll off into the third quarter and then we get the typical seasonality as well in the back half of the year brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah so all of those factors i think paul laid out earlier but what were reminding people is last year when we unwound the joint venture and have told you about it this time last year we said when we took it from a joint venture interest through the pl on the balance sheet interest it was going to increase our expenses that million this is the quarter where it happens so we just want to make sure people are factoring that in absent that you know that we manage expenses tightly in this company and well manage them down and well have some pluses and minuses and well work it down but we didnt want people to forget that we told you that last year all the rest then will be the same sort of management practice we had you have some ppp expenses theyve come down a little bit as people have moved around and opened up a little bit you have a little more business activity expenses well see it play out and then you have the seasonality as you mentioned and that will all be standard fare but the key difference is we want to make sure people didnt forget what we told you last year brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then a separate one thats simple is the tax rate guide that you gave in the second half does that roll forward into thanks paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp i dont think we have a good answer for you for yet at least i dont have an answer we can get back to you on that if you need it but for the rest of the year it will be around brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks operator and well take our final question today from charles peabody with portales please go ahead charles peabody q analyst portales partners llc bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 yeah i wanted to get some more color on your consumer and community bank and particularly the profitability of the various product lines like cards mortgages autos branching and i ask that because on a relative basis your consumer and community bank has done much better than the other big three wells jpmorgan and citi and i know a big part of it is probably cards where the other businesses are losing money the other companies are losing money in cards so can you talk a little bit about the profitability of your different product lines and the relative value that they produce for you guys versus other major banks brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp im not sure quite frankly i agree with your premise that the profitability of our consumer bank is driven by the deposit business and so given that youre in the middle of a twist right now with rates falling and the floors of zero rates in the consumer business the card it fell this quarter but that would be expected as you go through this twist so its been running the deposit segment had been running billion a quarter type of numbers and thats and the consumer lending segment would have been running even back in about billion a quarter so its a business which is and thats all lending not just the card lending so its a business which is driven by the deposit business and when the rates fell this quickly and we moved rates down in the quarter its going to take a little while to catch back up and but thats im not sure i agree with the premise that its driven by the card business the card business is a portion of that third of the general operating profit paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp i think youre right brian the way to think about it is we started at a position of profitability before rates came down that was stronger than many of our competitors given the strength of our deposit franchise and given how careful we have been with respect to credit unsecured consumer credit youre now seeing us getting hurt on the because that deposit franchise isnt those deposits arent as valuable in the environment but youre not seeing us having the same sort of potential losses in unsecured consumer because we just dont have as much as others brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp be that as it may the lending portion lost money this quarter and the deposit business continue to make money this quarter so im not sure i get the starting point but just to give you a sense so it wasnt a lot of money overall but it was made by the deposit business charles peabody q analyst portales partners llc i guess the starting point was that the card businesses tend to be an outsized product for the other big banks and they clearly are losing money and so is that the big differentiation that is your card business losing money this quarter as well but less so than the other big businesses other big companies brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yes the lending business lost money we dont i dont have the separate card pl but the lending business and consumer lost money the deposit business made money and brought it to profit and offset billion of losses on the lending side because of the provisions versus billion of profit after taxes but remember what drives the profitability of the consumer business is the position we have across all the products we dont think of a lending business in this we think of a customer business that is number one position in deposits a core bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2020 checking account checking account growth of million accounts yearoveryear the average balances of those accounts growing yearoveryear even taking out the covid impact they are still growing at doubledigits typically in a year the operating costs coming down yearoveryear in terms of as a percentage of deposits these are all good measures that give you a great anchor to windward it gets tougher when rates are very low weve played that ive been ceo for this is my 11th year and through of the i think that the fed funds rate has basically been zero a quarter and so thats what were doing the card business is a nice business we keep it to a size that we think is consistent with our team commitment to responsible growth and therefore its never going to drive the pl one way or the other way and the risk adjusted margin is in that business today theyre in actual chargeoffs remember whats causing the losses is that youre putting up reserves for the rest of the life of the portfolio in one quarter given an economic scenario which has deteriorated so its a good its a wonderful business for us its our biggest business in terms of profit but we dont run it as a card business as a loan business we got out of that a decade ago saying it is a consumer business and we drive it on a unified basis charles peabody q analyst portales partners llc all right thank you operator it appears we have no further questions ill return the floor to brian for closing remarks brian t moynihan chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well thank you and thank you for spending time with us this morning its another quarter where weve driven responsible growth we continue to manage this company tightly given the environment were in and we continue to
