corp good morning and thank you for joining us i want to start by sending our thoughts to the impacted areas from the devastation of recent storms especially our impacted teammates and their families our teams remain busy assisting those clients and associates in the impacted areas so were going to start on slide of the earnings materials this quarter bank of america reported billion in net income or per diluted share we grew revenue yearoveryear we delivered our fifth straight quarter of operating leverage every business segment delivered operating leverage this takes us back to our fiveyear run before the pandemic the highlights this quarter were also once again marked by good organic customer activity this was coupled with a significant increase in net interest income in addition the teams adapted well to our new capital requirements and as a result our common equity tier ratio or cet1 ratio improved by nearly basis points to moving basis points above its current minimums bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 the decline from prioryear reported net income and eps comparisons reflect a reserve build versus a reserve release last year at the same time however our asset quality remains strong as net chargeoffs and several other metrics in fact improved from the second quarter pretax preprovision income grew yearover year from a return perspective we produced a rotce and a basis point roa our efficiency ratio this quarter dropped to taking out the litigation it would have been so even while investing in marketing and people and technology and physical plant the team continues to drive operational excellence an easy way to think about this is we currently operate bank of america with less people than we had in seven years ago lets go to slide those continued investments over the past several years in our people tools and resources for our customers and teammates as well as our new and renovated financial centers has allowed us to continue to enhance the customer experience and fuel organic growth as we drive responsible growth in the third quarter alone we added more than 400000plus net new consumer checking accounts we added million new credit card accounts we added new funded investment accounts in our consumer business customers are finding it increasingly convenient to access us digital users grew to million logins by those users cleared billion in the past quarter billion per month erica surpassed billion interactions since it was introduced four years ago this quarter it has become a primary interaction method for our clients with more than million interactions this quarter alone when you look at our sales of third quarter sales were digital a yearoveryear increase this occurred even as we fully reopened our financial centers and had our teammates also selling now once again you could find all these digital statistics and more in the appendix of our earnings material as usual i encourage you to look at those statistics for every one of the lines of business not just consumer they compare favorable to any of the competitive measures we see when we see people actually publish their numbers at the same time million customers visited our financial center in the quarter this highlights the importance of having both hightouch and hightech approach in wealth management business we added advisors this quarter our advisors added nearly new households in the merrill and private bank areas we saw solid net flows despite the turbulence in the markets of our gwim customers are digitally active of the new merrill accounts are opened digitally that combined with our consumer investments business has seen more than billion of net client flows yeartodate we continue to see increased activity both in investments as well as the banking products in this area this quarter gwim opened a record number of bank accounts gwim also saw its 50th consecutive quarter of average loan growth the banking capabilities and success differentiates our platform the business grew revenue delivered operating leverage and saw a record pretax preprovision growth even in choppy markets as we turn to global banking ending loan balances were down linked quarter however we did see solid production in this area and that was offset by client paydowns decrease in the value of foreigndenominated loans and loans sold to manage our riskweighted assets which helped us build the capital levels i talked about earlier as we look at global markets the team had a strong third quarter in sales and trading performance in fact in the third quarter of was the strongest since the third quarter of it grew from last year it was led by bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 strong performance in our macro ficc business which has benefited by investments made over the past year we had no trading loss days this quarter let me also make a few points using the customer activity highlighted on the continued resilience of bank of americas broad customer base so if you look at slide you can see some points about the overall health that demonstrate whats going on in the customer base let me make a couple key points first consumers continue to spend at strong levels second consumer customer average deposit levels for september remain at multiples of their pre pandemic levels you can see that in the lower right third theres plenty of capacity for borrowing as credit card balances at bac are still below prepandemic levels and the payment rates on those credit cards are basis points over prepandemic levels so on spending a couple thoughts a perspicacious analyst might wonder whether talk of inflation recession and other factors would fructify in a slower spending growth we just dont see it here at bank of america yearto date spending of trillion through september is up compared to last year second as you look across the periods you can see in the trend of yearoveryear spending as we entered the pandemic we saw spending decline and quickly recover and grow across the quarters and while still strong in september at spending growth has slowed just a bit from the yeartodate pace which shows you that earlier in the year was the faster yearoveryear growth rate but still strong and the first two weeks of october show that strength as still growing at its notable that it isnt just inflation that is driving spending as transactions are up at singledigits yearoveryear pretty consistently youll also note on the bottom left the continued growth in goods and services particularly retail toward experiences of travel and entertainment while fuel price volatility continues it is not currently impacting the spend levels in this quarter as prices stabilize on the level of customer liquidity the level of customer liquidity remains strong average deposit balances of our consumer customer remain at high levels relative to yearago these balances are still multiples of the pre pandemic periods and they were largely unchanged at these elevated amounts for the month of september these deposit levels suggest continued capacity for spending at healthy levels on slide we show you as we did last quarter some other stats about resiliency as you can see whether you look at early or latestage card delinquencies they all remain well below our prepandemic levels these are decadesold lows and were just now seeing gradual move off these lows in earlystage delinquencies latestage delinquencies are still below prepandemic levels keep in mind asset quality metrics were strong even before the pandemic on this page what you see is the and 90day card delinquencies if you compare them against the average for the past five years leading up to the pandemic a period of growth and unemployment falling those averages were basis points and basis points respectively so the current ratio delinquencies would have to worsen or more to even approach that fiveyear prepandemic average at a time of economic growth and falling unemployment so consumers remain resilient let me take a couple minutes to talk to you quickly about the balance sheet and ill turn it over to alastair as you think about loan and deposits balances in general were seeing what we expected as monetary policy tightens bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 on deposits we see clients with excess liquidity looking for yield with that being the global banking movements you can see from moving from noninterestbearing to interestbearing accounts or in our wealth management business we saw clients shift out of brokerage sweeps into preferred deposits or other investment products like treasuries that we offer but if you look at our core customer base where the transactional balances drive the outcome we are seeing steady balances driven by new account activity in the good value proposition we have for our customers when you think about loans consumer loan balance growth was led by card and reflects increased marketing and continued reopening of financial centers building high levels of new customer relationships on commercial while average loans rose billion linked quarter or annualized you did see a modest ending balance decline as good loan production was offset by the sale or syndication of billion of loans and also by billion in negative foreign currency impacts we obviously took activity on balance sheet optimization which helped our rwa discussion helped reduce our rwas and led to the capital levels i talked about earlier we have provided an update in the appendix as to the credit transformation of our loan portfolio and a few other consumer credit slides that help illustrate the quality of our portfolio under years of responsible growth we updated the slides again this quarter to show you them and you can find them in the appendix and i recommend them to you so in summary client activity remains good niis has improved quickly and the customers resilience and health remains strong weve also managed our expenses very well we drove operating leverage the team managed the balance sheet well and improved capital even increased our dividend and bought back a modest amount of shares we call that responsible growth and with that ill turn it over to alastair alastair borthwick chief financial officer bank of america corp thank you brian and ill start by adding a little more detail on the income statement and refer you to slide highlights you can see here revenue of billion grew with nii improving yearoveryear while our fees declined and ill cover the nii improvement in just a moment on noninterest income the volatility and the levels of market activity drove a yearoveryear decline in investment banking and asset management fees while sales and trading benefited from investments made in the business and the volatile market conditions additionally service charges moved lower for two reasons first in consumer we completed the sweeping changes around insufficient funds and overdraft in june marking a reduction from june of second our corporate service charges declined as earned credit rates increased for clients and that overwhelmed organic growth in the gross fees associated with treasury management services performed for our clients expenses this quarter were billion and they included the settlement of our last large remaining legacy monoline insurance litigation as you likely saw on october we filed the 8k announcing a settlement that resolved all of the outstanding litigation with ambac and that dates all the way back to the financial crisis we recorded million in litigation expense this quarter above previous accruals for payment of the settlement and without that litigation cost our expense would have been just below the billion mark bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 okay lets move to the balance sheet and well look at slide where you can see during the quarter the balance sheet declined billion to trillion that was driven by a billion decline in deposits and coupled with a billion decline in securities our average liquidity portfolio declined in the quarter reflecting the decrease in deposits and security levels at billion our liquidity still remains billion above prepandemic levels just to give you an idea of just how much our liquidity has increased shareholders equity was stable with the second quarter at billion as earnings were offset by capital distributed to shareholders and the change in aoci from rate moves we paid out billion in common dividends we bought back million in gross share repurchases and that covered our employee issuances in the quarter leaving no dilutive impact for shareholders aoci declined billion as a result of the increase in loan rates and we saw the impact primarily in two ways first we had a reduction from a change in the value of our afs debt securities that was billion and that impacted cet1 second rates also drove a billion decline in aoci from derivatives and that does not impact cet1 that reflects cash flow hedges mostly put in place last year against some of our variable rate loans and that protected us against cet1 with regard to regulatory capital our supplemental leverage ratio increased to versus our minimum requirement of which still leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth and our tlac ratio remains comfortably above our requirements okay lets go to the cet1 waterfall on slide and we can talk about that as youll recall back in last quarter we talked about our june ccar results where our stress capital buffer increased from to and that increased our overall cet1 ratio minimum requirement from to as of the beginning of the fourth quarter our capital levels today remain strong with billion of cet1 and through the good work of our teams we improved our cet1 ratio by basis points compared to june taking us to that leaves us well above our new minimum requirement so well walk through the drivers this quarter first its billion of earnings net of preferred dividends and that generated basis points of capital and then also importantly through optimization of the balance sheet we managed our rwa balances down and that added basis points more of capital ratio improvement dividends used basis points of capital and this quarter the movement in treasury and mortgagebacked securities rates caused the fair value of our afs debt securities to decrease and that lowered our cet1 ratio by basis points we remain wellpositioned for the rate movement because of the hedge of a large portion of this portfolio continuing to protect us from aoci movements while benefiting niis and swap to floating so we feel like our teams rose to the challenge well this quarter in terms of increased capital requirements on slide weve laid out average loans and looking at those loans and providing a bit more detail on a year overyear basis you can see average growth as commercial loans grew and consumer loans grew within consumer credit card grew focusing on more nearterm growth versus the second quarter of our average total loans grew on an annualized basis led by annualized commercial loan growth and annualized credit card growth while other consumer loans were relatively flat linked quarter bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 this slower linkedquarter growth included two notable impacts that brian mentioned we saw good commercial loan demand and we also saw fx valuations adjustments as a result of the strong dollar and then some loan sales and syndications that lowered our rwas partially offsetting some of the strong card growth in consumer loans we sold about billion of residential mortgage loans adjusting for the fx impact and loan sales loan growth from  was closer to the industrys growth rate lets focus now on deposits using slide and you can see there that our average deposits yearover year are up at trillion the noninterestbearing deposits are down while the interestbearing are up so overall we grew our deposits and as you would expect in a rising rate environment weve seen some shifts from noninterestbearing into interestbearing and its important to understand the makeup of these moves in consumer our total deposits are up yearoveryear these are core and foundational elements of the customers financial activities and weve seen growth in both noninterestbearing and interest bearing balances and we remain very disciplined on trillion of total consumer deposits while fed funds is now at so customers see the value in their total relationship with us through their personalized client engagement and our industryleading digital capabilities and rewards we expect that to continue do we expect deposit rates to increase yes of course and we will remain both disciplined and competitive and that is built into our asset sensitivity on a linkedquarter basis our consumer deposits moved lower by less than in wealth management total deposits are flat yearoveryear and again its important to understand that as expected these are the clients who generally have more excess liquidity and have historically saw higher rates both in deposit accounts as well as movements outside of deposits where we offer alternatives for those clients while flat yearoveryear within that we saw a billion decline in yearoveryear average deposits on our brokerage platform with some shifts from sweeps to preferred deposits within the platform meanwhile merrill bank deposits and deposits with private bank have grown billion the highertiered preferred deposit products represent a little more than of the mix of deposits and theyre moving largely in line with shortterm rates while the other or so deposit products are paying much lower rates on a linkedquarter basis we saw total gwim deposits decline by further highlighting these trends in global banking we hold about billion in customer deposits and we saw a yearoveryear decline in a rising rate environment where excess balances can be more expensive we typically see some runoff particularly in high liquidity environments as clients both use cash for inventory build and begin to manage their cash for yield and weve seen the mix of interestbearing deposits move from a year ago to nearly and were paying an increased rate on those interestbearing deposits pricing is largely customer by customer based on the depth of relationship and many other factors and again were not really seeing anything unexpected here betas at this point are still favorable to the last cycle and as we would just note relative to the last cycle the fed increases have been pretty rapid and wed expect to pay higher rates as we continue to move through this rate cycle its probably too early to say right now if at the end of that cycle the percentage of those rate passthroughs will be similar to the last cycle turning to slide and net interest income on a gaap nonfte basis nii in  was billion and the fte nii number was billion focusing on fte net interest income increased billion from  or and thats driven by benefits from higher interest rates including lower premium amortization and from loan bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 growth versus the second quarter nii is up billion driven largely by the same factors plus an additional day of interest in the quarter yearoveryear now average shortterm interest rates have increased 200plus basis points driving up the interest earned on our variable rate assets while weve maintained discipline on our deposit pricing and that has driven nearly billion of the improvement longterm interest rates on mortgages have increased even more than shortterm rates and thats improving fixedrate asset replacement and driving down refinancing of mortgage assets therefore slowing the recognition of premium amortization recognized in our securities portfolio yearoveryear that premium amortization has improved billion and additionally lower securities balances over the past six months modestly offset the benefits of yearoveryear loan growth but then net interest yield was and that improved basis points from the third quarter of basis points of that improvement occurred in the most recent quarter and as you will note excluding global markets activities our net interest yield was this quarter looking forward as it relates to nii guidance id like to make a couple comments and first i need to make a couple of caveats our guidance is going to assume interest rates in the most recent forward curve and that they materialize that we see modest loan growth and modest deposit balance changes with marketbased deposit pricing increasing baked in with that said we expect nii in  to be at least billion higher than  so last quarter when we were together we told you we expected to see consecutive nii increases of about billion in  and another billion in  and that would make a total of billion then in  and  given weve just put up billion in  and that outperformance and refreshing our expectation for  at billion were now saying that aggregate quarterly improvement wont be the billion we initially thought its increased to around billion or more turning to asset sensitivity and focusing on a forward yield basis at september it declined billion to billion of expected nii over the next months with now roughly of the sensitivity driven by short rates and on a spot basis our sensitivity to basis points instantaneous rate hike would be billion okay lets turn to expense and well use slide for the discussion third quarter expenses were billion and were flat with the second quarter as litigation costs for our settlement in  nearly offset the fines agreed to last quarter on a comparative basis and its nice to bring resolution to these matters without the costs associated with the resolutions in both periods expenses would have been just less than billion we continue to make steady investments in our people technology marketing and financial centers and what allows us to help pay for these investments are the operational process improvements weve talked about and the increased digital adoption rates by our customers and by our bankers our head count this quarter increased by and if we adjust for the release of our summer interns our head counts actually up by closer to we welcomed new fulltime associates from college campuses around the world into our company this quarter and we hired another net new people on top of that that included just less than across our various lines of business and another in staff and support and bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 technology positions to support those lines of business and with all the great benefits and talented people already at this company and with our great brand it highlights that bank of america is a great place to work as we look forward wed expect our fourth quarter expenses will land our full year reported expense at approximately billion that obviously includes the costs noted for resolving the second quarter and third quarter regulatory and litigation matters so without that our expenses are expected to be a little more than the billion level we talked about earlier in the year and were proud of our teams discipline around expense particularly in this inflationary environment while at the same time were modestly increasing our level of investment in the companys future and our growth turning to asset quality on slide and i want to start by saying just as brian did that asset quality of our customers remains very healthy the net chargeoffs of million declined million from the second quarter that decline was driven by prior period chargeoffs associated with the sale of some noncore mortgage loans we discussed last quarter absent those losses net chargeoffs were relatively stable with the prior period provision expense was million in the third quarter and that was million higher than the second quarter and we built million of reserve in the period compared to a modest release in  the reserve build in the quarter primarily reflects good credit card loan growth and a dampened macroeconomic outlook even as we build our reserves for the future this quarter we saw many of our asset quality metrics continue to show modest improvement as npls and reservable criticized both declined from  and you can see that in the supplement on slide we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios and theres only one point i want to make looking at this slide and that is delinquencies because our consumer delinquencies remain well below prepandemic levels and as brian noted earlier were watching closely the earlystage card delinquencies as they begin to increase modestly lastly the recent hurricane ian impacted some areas where we have strong market shares for many of our businesses and our teams have spent the past days assessing the damages and insurance coverage down to the loan level and weve already incorporated that analysis into our reserves for the quarter we compared our analysis to other large storms in recent years like sandy harvey and irma where we incurred just a small amount of financial losses turning to the business segments lets start with consumer banking on slide and brian shared earlier weve got organic growth across the checking accounts the card accounts and investments picking up this quarter not necessarily because of anything were doing differently in the past days but as a result of many years of retooling and continuously investing in the business we have the leading retail deposit market share we have leadership positions among all of the important products were the leading digital bank with tremendous convenient capabilities for consumer and small business clients weve got a leading online consumer investment platform and the best small business platform offering for our clients so as a result customer satisfaction is now at alltime highs and that is helping us to drive strong financial results the consumer banking earned billion on good organic growth and delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of operating leverage while we continued heavy investments for the future the impact of strong yearoveryear revenue growth of was partially offset by an increase in provision expense and the provision increase bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 reflected reserve builds this period mostly for card growth versus a reserve release in the third quarter of our net chargeoffs remain low and stable while reported earnings were only modestly up yearoveryear pretax preprovision income grew year overyear which highlights the earnings improvement coming through without the impact of the reserve actions card revenue was solid and increased modestly yearoveryear as spending benefits were mostly offset by higher rewards costs service charges were down million yearoveryear as our insufficient funds and overdraft policy changes were in full effect now by the end of  and because of the scale of the business and the diverse revenue we fully absorbed that revenue impact and are now benefiting from the benefits of overall customer satisfaction lower attrition in our client base and lower cost associated with fewer customer complaint calls associated with less nuisance fees expense increased from business investments for growth including people digital and marketing along with costs related to opening the business to fuller capacity much of the companys increased salary and wage moves in the quarter impact consumer banking the most we also continued our investment in financial centers opening another in the quarter while we renovated nearly more both digital banking and operational process improvements are helping to pay for those investments and as revenue grew weve improved the efficiency ratio to moving to slide wealth management produced strong results earning billion and thats a particularly strong result given both equity and bond market levels if they remain unchanged for the rest of the year this would be only the first time since that both equity and bond markets were down for the year now the volatility and generally lower markets levels have put pressure on revenue in this business and whats helping to differentiate merrill and the private bank right now is a strong banking business in this case to the tune of billion of deposits and billion of loans so while many of our brokerage peers face declines in revenue and margin weve seen yearoveryear revenue growth of and a margin of driving the sixth straight quarter of operating leverage and we saw enough revenue growth from banking products in  that more than offset declines in assets under management and brokerage fees our talented group of financial advisors coupled with our powerful digital capabilities allowed modern merrill to gain net new households and the private bank gained more in the quarter both up nicely from net household generation in we added billion of loans since  of growing and this marked our 50th consecutive quarter of average loans growth in the business consistent and sustained performance asset under management flows were billion in the quarter and billion since this time last year expenses increased driven by continued clientfacing hiring and higher other employeerelated costs as our advisors are increasing their inperson engagement with clients and thats partially offset by lower revenuerelated incentives on slide youll see our global banking results where we earned billion in  on strong revenue growth as higher nii more than offset lower noninterest income earnings were down yearoveryear driven in large part by the absence of a prior period reserve release our revenue growth is quite healthy given the more than decline in investment banking fees coupled with lower recent revenue while the companys overall investment banking fees declined billion yearoveryear in a continued tough market investment banking fees did improve modestly from  and the teams did a nice job of holding on to our bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 number three ranking in overall fees in a tough environment otherwise in fees we saw a decline in corporate service charges as enterprise credit rates rose with increased rates and that outpaced the growth in gross treasury service fees generated from new and existing clients id also remind you that gts benefits greatly from the nii off of deposits that more than offsets this so our year overyear total gts revenue is up we also had lower leasingrelated revenue comparatively the provision expense increase reflected a reserve build of million in  compared to a million release in the yearago period and with regard to expenses they increased yearoveryear driven by continued investments in the business for example in commercial banking our strategic hiring over the years has just continued to increase our client and prospect calling efforts switching to global markets on slide and as we usually do well talk about segment results excluding dva inflation continued geopolitical tensions and the changing monetary policies of central banks around the world continued to drive volatility in both the bond and equity markets as a result its another quarter that favored macro trading while credit trading businesses faced the continued challenging market environment with wider spreads and recession concerns so the third quarter of net income of billion reflects a good quarter of sales and trading revenue focusing on yearoveryear sales and trading contributed billion to revenue improving ficc improved while equities declined the ficc improvement was primarily driven by growth in our macro products while our credittraded products were down and weve been investing heavily over the past year in several macro businesses that we identified as opportunities for us and we were rewarded this quarter the decline in equities was driven by lower client activity in asia and a weaker performance in cash partially offset by good performance in derivatives where we saw increased client activity yearoveryear expense declined reflecting the absence of costs associated with the realignment of liquidating business activity that we took in the fourth quarter of and the business generated a return in the third quarter finally on slide we show all other which reported a loss of million declining from the yearago period driven by the litigation settlement that i noted earlier and higher tax expense on income tax expense i just want to mention one thing that made our tax rate a little higher this quarter and that is with the recent passage of the inflation reduction act of among other things it incorporated there was a change that allowed solar energy investments to elect production tax credits versus upfront investment tax credits and those production tax credits have the potential to earn more credits over the expected life of the production facility so as a result our third quarter tax expense is approximately million higher due to the net reversal of tax credits accrued for solar deals taken in the first half of that were recognized under initial investment tax credits at the time and we replaced with production tax credits so a little impact this quarter but net benefit to the shareholder over time this drove the effective tax rate a little higher this quarter to more than still obviously benefiting from our esg investment tax credits and excluding the impact of esg tax credits tax rate would have been approximately given the change noted for solar investments we expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be similar to the third quarter tax rate and well examine the further effects of these changes and how they impact full year and report on that next quarter and with that im going to stop there and open it for qa bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question today from jim mitchell with seaport global your line is open jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning guys maybe just on nii i think theres a lot of uncertainty around deposit behavior betas what the catchup rate could be with deposit pricing but you guys indicated that youre still pretty asset sensitive so how do you think about the trajectory of nii next year can it keep growing from sort of the  level through next year alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp thanks jim jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc assuming your forward curve is realized sorry alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah yeah so the short answer is yes we believe so and we believe that really for three reasons the first one is were still expecting future rate hikes and theres going to be some lag to their impact so youll start to feel some of that in  for example for the late hikes in this quarter jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp second were anticipating loans growth is still pretty good at this stage so were anticipating that well keep growing on the loan side and then third weve got an opportunity to restrike our balance sheet at higher rates with every opportunity now as things come off of our existing securities portfolio so look weve got our assumptions in there to be competitive on deposit pricing in each of the various segments but yes we believe well grow nii next year jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc from run rates alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 yes correct jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc yeah okay and then maybe as a followup you guys have done a pretty great job on hedging aoci risk in afs book my understanding is that the benefit those are sort of delayed start swaps is there a material benefit coming from those swaps in the fourth quarter and beyond how should we think about alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc that alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp so just the way our own alm projected over the course of the next couple years we had some forwardstarting swaps those are going to pay us floating in the fourth quarter and thats a contributor to the nii growth in the fourth quarter but i think you should assume a little bit third quarter most all in fourth quarter and thats probably it jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay great thank you operator well go next to erika najarian with ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc i just wanted i wanted to ask a question about expenses i think part of a bearish thesis on the stock is that bearish investors expect some sort of expense catchup relative to how your closest peer one of your closest peers is budgeting expenses for not just this year but next year heard you loud and clear on the billion plus the litigation settlement for full year but as we think about coming years and think about the investments that youve made youve highlighted the head count additions in the third quarter will the expectation of to expense growth still hold as we look forward or does inflation and investments change that range upward bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp so erika we continue to invest heavily along multiple dimensions people technology restructuring all the physical plant marketing and so but yet through the core operational excellence discipline this company has and has shown as i said earlier seven years later we have the same number of people the company is a lot bigger than it was in and so we continue to reposition money from things we can eliminate the work by the engineering and work and the technology investments we make to enabling the customers use of that technology and plow back into the production side of the company and so we dont i think if you think about this years third quarter versus third quarter you take it out the litigation theres about million increase in expenses yearoveryear million of that is marketing another chunk is another couple hundred million dollars technology this is quarterly not annual but quarterly numbers and then on top of that the amount of physical plant change in that time is huge not only in our branches but all over our company so we feel strong we continue to increase investments technology will go up this year versus versus and those expense numbers were giving you but we pay for it by not investing and hoping something happens we expect ph things to rectify in near terms and bring forth the fruit and drive expense efficiencies and effectiveness and thats how we can take the managers in that time period i gave you the head count indiscernible came down people in that period of time we invested all in frontline people to help serve our clients erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my second question is on more significant buyback activity brian i think that the cet1 build is certainly coming faster than i think the street expected and im wondering do we need to see bank of america get to that before heavier buyback activity or do you think you could manage the heavier buyback activity as you build to that cet1 by january brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp so we bought back shares this quarter and still grew the capital our job is to drive our company to serve our customers and that first order of business for our capital is always to help the growth of the balance sheet especially on the lending and market side and so you should expect despite buybacks we will continue to increase but remember we are now sitting above what we are supposed to be sitting at on and so next year is already here so obviously the trade between building the buffer up a little bit more as you said from where we are now to basis points over the requirement is a little bit different we already exceed the requirement so well put a little bit towards the buffer well support the organic growth a little bit towards the buffer and then use the rest to send back to you guys erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 operator well go next to glenn schorr with evercore isi your line is open glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks very much im curious half your capital build was thanks to rwa mitigation you mentioned no loss days in the quarter despite all this market volatility you also i think mentioned some loan sales i dont know if that has to do with some of the levered loans working off book so i wonder if you could talk about rwa mitigation going forward and include in that whats left in the levered loan book to distribute thanks alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp so theres a couple things that are going on there i dont want to confuse them let me first talk about the leveraged finance thing that we just marked through our numbers its in the numbers we pushed it through we do it every week so thats included when you look at those global markets or investment banking results they include anything were doing in investment banking i dont think thats what brian was referring to what brian was referring to is the rwa optimization that were doing as a company to make sure that were in a great place to serve our customers and to be in a position to have the flexibility for buybacks in the future so couple things that we did there we did sell some loans you saw that in prior quarters in all other you can see some of the legacy loans we were able to sell in prior quarters this quarter we sold billion of loans in consumer and wealth and maybe billion in global banking so its not big but its important for us just to make progress in different areas and then most of the rwa optimization glenn that weve been doing is pretty quiet its taking the securities that are riskweighted asset and as they roll off and remember theres like billion of them roll off every quarter we can replace those with treasuries at a higher yield so were getting more yield and were reducing the rwas with that and then the other thing ill just say on rwa optimization is we probably tapped the brakes a little bit on loan production this quarter in a couple places and we did a little bit of cds hedging here and there and youll see if you look at our numbers youll also see that global markets just the way that customers are demanding balance sheet the balance sheet is still growing but the rwas are a little bit lower so theres a lot that goes into rwas but its billion here billion there you add it all up and it makes a difference glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi that was awesome i appreciate that and i guess very much related you just touched on it a little bit but im curious youre a prime and superprime bank in consumer lend you gave us enough details i know how youre thinking about growth there on the commercial side given what were all facing in this potential real buzz saw of an economy how do you approach risk and what business to take on i dont know if you could include in that thought what kind of maturity while youre looking at on the commercial side of the book thank you for all that appreciate it brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp so glenn what we always say to ourselves and our teammates is that the response of growth across the last decade plus leads us to where we are and so youre not going to do anything like this afternoon to change the impact candace and her team have negative growth not this quarter but the fourth quarter and first couple of bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 quarters next year modestly negative growth you know that youre not going to change your portfolio overnight so then the question is how do you manage it right so we have limits across all the different categories and you can see the spread of risk in the supplemental book you can see that nobody is a big part of it and then we look customer by customer anticipate whos going to be needing money in terms of refinancing but also in terms of just operating like we did during the pandemic with every single loan for the company with million in revenue more in our company on a quarterly basis indiscernible we had it so we worked that construct of the book who we underwrite client selection the structures of the deals et cetera and the spread of diversity among industries and us versus nonus et cetera but then on top of that we always work in the book hard and our ratings integrity is very high we can see it as measured in the indiscernible and other things against the third parties very rare that we have much to do on anything we have rated and we make sure we test that continuously with our credit review team under christine katziff and geoff greeners team because that at the end of the day make sure were not fooling ourselves and we continue to look at that and frankly i think this quarter we still had upgrades exceeded downgrades if you look at npls and reservable criticized they both went down this quarter again and so were seeing improvement in the credit book even though all of the parade of horribles that youve sort of alluded to and it wouldnt take a perspicacious person to read to see that because its in the paper every day but right now the credit continues to improve but its what we did over the last years years ph that held us in good stead as we head into this year glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks brian i appreciate it operator our next question comes from john mcdonald with autonomous research your line is open john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research good morning thanks i wanted to ask about the nii assumptions and maybe just your outlook around loan growth and what youre seeing in the economy what do you expect from loan growth you mentioned modest and then also alastair just the pace of deposit mix shift and betas that youre kind of building into your outlook would be helpful thanks alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well on the loan side id say we talked about at the beginning of the year that we thought loans would be high single digits and weve slightly outperformed that obviously this quarter was a little bit of a 90day reset for us in some ways you didnt see that so much in consumer because the card growth just came through in commercial certainly we probably held that back just a touch so we think well resume that sort of highsingle digit maybe mid if things begin to slow a little bit so weve got that in our forecast we sort of resume the path that weve been on with respect to deposits id say on betas obviously were just increasing those because weve got to be competitive in this environment and around balances i think theres a sense that the industry will be flattish bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 maybe down we think were going to outperform the industry ever so slightly so thats whats largely baked into our assumptions at this stage john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research and in terms of funding that the gap between the loan growth and flattish deposits securities came down a fair amount this quarter can you continue to rundown the securities portfolio and what kind of volume do you get from cash flows off the book there alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so the securities portfolio runs off at about billion a quarter it was a little more this quarter because we actually had an opportunity to sell some securities that offset some gains some losses and freed up some rwas so we took advantage of that this quarter and so the securities number this particular quarter was a little larger but i think on an ongoing basis john you should assume that weve got billion that just comes in and then broadly weve got billion of cash at the central bank and weve got another couple hundred billion of stuff thats mostly treasury swap to floating so weve got lots of ways to pay for loans growth in the future john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it okay thanks and if i could just clarify the discussion with erika around expenses the billion this year includes the litigation did you say next year youre kind of targeting lowsingle digit expense growth did you say positive operating leverage brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah i think we said that yeah it includes the litigation and then next year we said basically this year includes litigation and next year we said at some point well get back to the to rise well just have to see how some of the ins and outs play in terms of some of the stuff running off this year still left over from the pandemic but youve to look at the billion for three quarters in a row honestly each quarter has had a little bit of something in it john if you think about the first quarter where they had the fico and that type of stuff in it the second quarter had the regulatory stuff and third quarter had litigation so were bouncing around low and we expect that run rate to kind of hold john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research great thanks operator well go next to mike mayo with wells fargo your line is open brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 good morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi id like a little bit more detail on how you add employees and resources for the additional revenues from the second quarter to the third quarter your profit margin on the new revenues was i mean revenue was up billion expenses up zero thats clearly thats not sustainable but i would like you to if you can tie that into slide more digital users and sales zelle erica billion interactions your head counts not growing a whole lot how long can you keep that going and theoretically all this digitization over the past few years equates to like how many employees or how much in expenses or whats a terminal efficiency level relative to the past brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp so i think mike thats a lot of questions but ill try to sort it out a little bit starting with the last there is no terminal efficiency ratio our idea is when you work on expenses youre not working on the ratio it ends up in a ratio but youre working on the actual dollars spent and so we could keep working on investing heavily to drive that and the digitization of all the operational process and the company is what you see on slide on the consumer side and you see it in the other slides in some of the wealth management and commercial operations still a lot of paper in the gts business that we continue to take out so thats what were trying to do but interestingly enough whats driving the nearterm growth in employees has theres obviously financial advisor growth you saw the this quarter thats investing in the training programs and hiring some people into the office especially outside our footprint to get them growing again theres investment in commercial bankers those are not huge numbers the big investment in the gcib platform over the last year i think teammates last couple of years and so those investments come in but also were investing to drive the operational excellence platform and actually ensuring that weve got great customer service dealing with all the things that go on but a major part of it frankly is getting even though we have less branches yearoveryear less numbers of units we have more people in them because we continue to build out the relationship manager capabilities and branches as you said on page the work goes out of the branches from the daytoday sort of service things were putting more and more in relationship management and thats why you see 400000plus net new checking households this quarter which is a record for us going back to prefinancial crisis we dont know how far back it is if you look at small business originations they are going up if you look at merchant services sales which that was investment in sales force there and an investment so its just a combination of driving that and the continued digitization allows us to continue to be efficient effective and frankly plow the money saved back into marketing back into more technology and make us even more effective and then into people where we need them but tom scrivener runs our operations group sees a lot of stuff ahead of him he can take out and bruce thompson over the credit operations platform across all of the businesses a lot they can take out over time and we just go work on it alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp mike i think we dont necessarily translate it into that sort of idea of how many more people does digital thing replace our productivity metrics but if you look at it by different line of business if you just take consumer for a bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 moment of our consumer sales now are taking place digitally you almost think about that being the equivalent of more financial centers and it turns out if you give million people banking in their pocket with a mobile phone it makes a big difference mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then just a quick followup then so brian you said before the nii benefits would come barreling through to the benefit of investors that was the case this quarter do you expect that to continue to be the case over the next year brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp yes we said it last quarter and i hope i proved it true there to what you asked about last quarter and mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you yeah brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp other things mike to think about is if you go back and look at the consumer page in the deck youll see that the cost of deposits which is the overall cost of all the stuff against deposit basis continues to basically be basis points which is down from basis points years ago and that is extremely leverageable and by the way the profit margin of gwim is back up to and driving through so were letting that nii pullthrough which then drives those numbers up mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc one quick followup just i asked this for someone else they said they didnt really know the consumer deposit betas are outperforming for you and for some others why is that outperforming now and do you think thats going to last brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp the consumer if you go to the page on deposits theres only one theres a distinguishing fact that goes on in consumer that at our company and generally which really drives up a tremendous value proposition we have to be the core transaction core relationship bank for our customers and if you look at page you can see that the interest checking noninterestbearing accounts the dollar volume of deposit as a total percentage of deposits are a very high percentage and thats where we focus on and that allows you those are zero or very low rates because the amount of services that come around i mean they have access to branches to the call centers to the digital platform to the ability with zelle payments et cetera et cetera and thats what drives it so its a the beta is a product of the mix more than it is a product of any pricing strategy because zerobased zero interest noninterestbearing checking are zero in any rate environment bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator our next question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning the capital build was obviously faster than expected or at least what most of us have expected and it doesnt really seem like there was much revenue drag from that can you kind of flip the script here and lean into certain businesses and i guess im thinking as we look globally theres some peers that are needing to build capital so maybe theres some opportunity for further share gains in areas like markets and global banking brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah look were in a good position on capital even after the increased stress capital buffer results which surprised our industry and our company and we appealed that as you well know and didnt get relief but we hope its looked at in the future but the capital improvement really didnt take much of revenue hit honestly the only place we had to be careful on was loan production in the highend businesses ie gcib other than that the markets business has an allocation of the size of balance sheet and capital and rwa which basically they were able to achieve all of the results with not even using it up and jimmy demare and the team do a great job there the rest of it everything else was there was no real change and frankly where we are now those changes that tapping is gone for this quarter already and were out doing what we should do matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then separately just a little nerdy modeling question as we think about the timing of the tax credits being pushed out driving the tax rate slightly higher is there an offset in that all other fee line that i think is viewed in tandem with the tax rate and that you have ph few credits alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so i would think about it this way the effective tax rate for  and  likely a little bit higher than our original guided to but for the full year it should end up right around that mark and then id say this year youre right in the fourth quarter in all other we have to take into account the fact that the esg deals and their timing so i think for your model matt i would use million of an aftertax loss for the fourth quarter as the most likely and im talking all other now and if youre asking me with respect to the consolidated other income then id use something very similar to the fourth quarter of where we had an million pretax loss so i would just use that there okay matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 okay and thats the high watermark of a year right alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah thats just the seasonal nature of these esg deals and their installation generally matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you operator our next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning just another just question or two on fees can you just walk us through some of the deltas in the service charges line just talk about i know you had mentioned both the overdraft run ratings deposit changes and ecr just how much of that is embedded by now and what should we look for going forward from those areas thanks alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so ken i think with respect to card kind of flattish as i would think about it right now a little bit of fourth quarter seasonal maybe that should benefit there service charges most importantly on the consumer side all the nsfod were now at the steadystate run rate so that wont be hurting us again from this point forward the commercial part youre right to highlight but the commercial business the gts business is adding clients were doing more with clients so thats adding gross fees but many of the clients prefer that earnings credit adjustment as the way that they essentially pay interest receive interest and then pay fees so that came down probably million in this quarter i think you should expect that to come down again next quarter just with the way rates are going and then the other fees are probably pretty straightforward wealth will be all about market levels with a one month lag based on where the markets are investment banking kind of flattish i would think maybe hoping for a little bit of positive at some point but not necessarily this quarter and then sales and trading your guess is as good as ours but that we generally point to the sort of seasonality in  compared to  and were coming off of obviously a pretty good period brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp let me ken just one of the things i think it goes a little bit to mikes point a little bit to some of the other points is that about 80odd percent if i got exact i think its if i got it right of the interchange goes back to the customer base in terms of rewards products either directly through our own rewards programs or through some affinity group programs so obviously as charges go up a fair amount of that goes back now what does that produce in value it produces incredible value so a lot of that in our preferred rewards fee structure which go the rewards structure which goes across all products in our company if you even just look at bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 the preferred segment and why deposit pricing and the stability of our accounts is different than peers through the last cycle well see what happens this time is that that rewards structure cements the customer relationship and so that then has a retention rate plus of those preferred customers who have about all the deposits on a consumer segment and they are very stable important customer base as all our customer bases are so you have to think through on those fees were effectively investing in those fees in the duration of customer base the length of customer base the profitability of customer base the stability of customer base and the fact that then we can net produce a lot more customers because were not having to replace the runoff and so as you see so many fee lines same with nsfod by doing what weve done the attrition rate has obviously dropped to the floor and youre seeing more production of net accounts there and these are all related to total revenue per customer profit per customer as opposed to any individual decision ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thanks for all that color i got just one separate question on you mentioned that this credit continues to improve and youre seeing some underlying can you just work us through just to remind us just where you are in terms of your scenarios from a cecl perspective and if the economy does in fact change how weighted are you already to an already worsening scenario alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so this quarter very similar to last quarter we use blue chip consensus as our baseline youre talking different economists some of whom are in the middle some of whom are pessimistic themselves some of whom are more optimistic thats thats the baseline the other is downside scenarios that we build and there thats the weighting then were applying and in this particular quarter just to give you an idea ken once again we increased our forecast for inflation in that scenario we increased unemployment in that scenario and we decreased gdp through the course of the next couple years so all of that thats a few quarters now in a row where that pattern is continuing and we did it again this quarter and well just keep adjusting that over time based on the macroeconomic situations that develops over time brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp yes alastair just to give a sense though its a unemployment like now and then continues all the way through next year so theres an inherent conservatism built into that reserving level our reserve in there is and has those kinds of statistics around so whether it has inflation but more importantly its based on kind of that unemployment level which is basis points over where we are and we are in october so it would be pretty quick to move to the at the end of the year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thank you very much alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 yeah it moves even higher than that next year just to give you an idea its sort of in the mid just to give you the general sense ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood thank you operator well go next to vivek juneja with jpmorgan your line is open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks just a couple of questions brian and alastair ph how loan marks a quick one how much were those in the third quarter alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp so we didnt call that out vivek just for the simple reason it was smaller this quarter we run those through the pl every week as you know so the results that you see in global markets and investment banking did include them last quarter we called it out last quarter because it was just bigger but this quarter we didnt feel that we needed to vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay brian you talked about tech spend being up if i caught it correctly in is that right and if so whats the dollar amount of tech spend that youre expecting in either this year or next year brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp this year we are around billion next year we move up of it billion or something like that so vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay this is for the new product development type of brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah then other people talk about the overall number is like billion this is for the platform and all the other stuff this is purely new code is what we think vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah yeah got it and for both of you what are you expecting as the impact of qt on deposits what are you modeling in bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well were obviously modeling in probably the same thing you are were going to have to price competitively for deposits in an environment where obviously marketbased expectations are changing every day so were anticipating its going to be a little bit tougher from this point forward but thats already baked into our nii vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i guess to get more precise alastair since you have better resources and better data than we do what betas where do you expect betas to get to alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well thats going to differ by customer base and i dont want to get into this on this call just because its competitively important for us obviously but you can assume that at the higher end of wealth for example i shared that were passing through most of that at this stage thats going to be very different versus our noninterestbearing accounts it will be different for operational versus nonoperational and commercial so betas will be in quite different places but im anticipating that they will just continue to drift up over time vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks operator well go next to betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi just a couple of questions one is on how we think about comp going into next year weve got this inflation rate thats obviously seems higher for longer and while we expect it comes down over the next months youre going into the year with it at a pretty high level and social security is even going up like as we all know so wondering how you think about that youve done a great job at being on the front foot with regard to minimum wage increases in your shop so should we expect more of that to come into next years expense guide as well alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so i think betsy the last several months weve done the fifth share success program we did our usual merit we did a and merit increase for everybody under in compensation based on years of service weve accelerated a starting wage which is 40odd thousand dollars a year now and well continue those patterns and the good news is were seeing the attrition rate move start to move back it was dropped to moved back up to 15ish and has now dropped down to low and each month it starts to drop even more so we feel that weve got the right mix and we all look at benefits continuously we continue to indiscernible we increased our childcare benefit to per month per child increased our tuition reimbursement and did it in advance bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 and so its a complex package but we have been able to absorb all that and keep expenses bounce along at billion a quarter for the last three or four quarters and well continue to do that and thats where it comes down to also using the technology investments and operational excellence investments to continue to reduce the aggregate number of people we have working and pay those talent teammates we have even more while they work betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so expectation for that to persist meaning flat expenses yearonyear as we go into alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah weve said that wed start growing in the to category and thats part of these types of inflationary things that youre mentioning which are higher now and then working it down over time and so right now were running in the low billion per quarter billion and we expect it to maintain and grow but most of that growth does come as youre saying into the compensation and it ebbs and flows where it goes on a given when the markets are driving more investment banking markets and wealth management and those come down a little bit and the other compensation comes up as weve changed base pay and things like i talked about but its just its people its a very complex discussion all over the world so theres no one answer for the whole team betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah i get that okay thanks and thats helpful color just one other one alastair you mentioned the securities rolloff that youve been able to mix shift towards a higher yield over time can you give us a sense as to what kind of pull to par we should be thinking about for the model on the aoci hits that youve had to take how many quarters or years should we be thinking that gets erased over alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp so id say on the treasuries generally speaking if you just think about the duration there being somewhere between four and five years and on the mortgages its probably seven to eight so it takes a while to pull to par and then therell be some derivatives as well and i think the team can probably help you model that at some point but those are broadly speaking about the numbers i would use betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp obviously itll be faster for any securities that repay in the meantime betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 right yeah got it thanks operator well take our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is open brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi brian hi alastair alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp hi gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc alastair you touched on there is some earlystage delinquencies in the consumer book and not so much with the hurricane but can you give us any color and your numbers are obviously very strong but can you give us some color of what youre seeing there is it a lower fico score customer anything you can read into it alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp this is one of the things gerard you have to be careful of because obviously when a person doesnt pay you the fico is going down de facto so ph gerard the origination statistics we put in the back of the deck there are very strong remain strong and what were seeing is i gave you the fiveyear averages which will still far exceed where we are today and were still lower prepandemic so even though were ticking back up the word normalization i ask people to be careful with because were moving back to what was alltime lows and were not even there so i think if you look in the auto business the number of repossessions and stuff is down half on a monthly basis so we built under responsible growth we built a book in the consumer side that we knew would be durable through different modeled outcomes which is what we do in the stress testing and what we do in the reserve setting process and stuff but also through actual outcomes and what youre seeing is its weathering any notion of issues in the economy well now and then on the commercial book as we said we still see upgrades exceeding downgrades the simple way to think about it is i think were through the pl provision cost with flat reserve build pre pandemic was basically billion a quarter were running around that number now and thats building million of reserves its a little different constitution and that means unless chargeoffs tick up youre going to see the reserve builds start to mitigate because sort of were sitting there with a pretty conservative scenario now and itll all depend on that as we look forward but remember the baseline is now baking in effectively a recession based on the blue chip brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 gerard i think too if you went back through our supplement over the course of the past years youre going to find these numbers are so low like were squinting to see a change here and its coming off of really historically extraordinary numbers so is there a little bit of movement yes but is it the second best of all time yes gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good very good color can i follow up on the provision brian you just mentioned about the billion in the past if you took that worst you guys i think said in terms of your reserve build in terms of the base case on the economy versus a really difficult economy if that really difficult economy went to what type of provision on a quarterly basis would that push up to brian t moynihan a chair chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah i mean i think we have that but remember that id be careful about that because basically the baseline now has built into it a fairly weak forward path in the near term and so i wouldnt speculate exactly the numbers but if you saw it would build a bunch of reserves with a unemployment and ph projection that debt was going to go on whatever like it was in the pandemic and you saw us move up but were sitting closer to what we called cecl day one and pandemic implementation then you can see some of that in the stress test so we dont really speculate on that but we have on stress test to test it to make sure and you can see the fed stress test and the adverse case you can see the numbers frankly which i dont think would ever materialize given what you do in the period of time between then and there but that gives you some sense if you look at those indiscernible gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good appreciate the color thank you operator well take our final question today from charles peabody with portales your line is open charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut yeah most of my questions were asked already but im just curious if you had any thoughts about how the basel iii endgame might play out and the timing of implementation of that or any general thoughts on the color alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp no no particular updates at this point obviously were waiting along with everybody else and once we get the rules charles well sit down and well start working through our own capital base but obviously as brian pointed out earlier just the fact that weve now put ourselves in a position where already were ahead of where we need to be in january of weve got a lot of flexibility at this point for whatever the endgame does come out with charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut thank you bank of america corp bac corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 brian t moynihan chair chief executive officer bank of america corp okay well thank you for all your questions and your attention let me just summarize for the third quarter you saw responsible growth in action once again we had organic growth in all businesses we had top line revenue growth driven by the nii increases we had strong expense control flat expenses for the third straight quarter operating leverage for the fifth straight quarter and good work on that we had good risk management you can see that were still running strong risk parameters and we built the capital to the end state levels that we need so thats what we call responsible growth and now youre seeing it in action thank you operator this does conclude todays program
