ended december net income available to common stockholders for the three months ended march was also billion compared to million for the three months ended december diluted eps totaled for the three months ended march compared to for the three months ended december first quarter net income and diluted eps were impacted by a bargain purchase gain of billion arising from the purchase and assumption of certain assets and liabilities in the signature bridge bank transaction the signature transaction we believe the signature transaction strengthens our deposit base lowers the loantodeposit ratio adds liquidity and provides the opportunity to pay down wholesale funding it also further diversifies our loan portfolio away from cre loans and more toward commercial loans and expands our net interest margin we believe the signature transaction will be accretive to both earnings per share and to tangible book value per share while maintaining strong capital ratios in addition to the bargain purchase gain our first quarter results were impacted by the following items mergerrelated and restructuring expenses of million comprised of million for the flagstar acquisition and million for the signature transaction an initial provision for credit losses totaling million for the loans acquired from signature and first full quarter of flagstar bank activity to our balance sheet and overall financial results loan portfolio at march total ci loans were billion compared to billion at december the majority of the increase is attributable to the billion of ci loans acquired in the signature transaction in addition organic ci loan growth totaled billion on a linkedquarter basis largely the result of growth in specialty finance lending and the mortgage warehouse business the multifamily loan portfolio was billion at march down slightly compared to billion at december the slight decline during the current first quarter was due to a combination of higher interest rates and

directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share on the companys common stock the dividend is payable on may to common stockholders of record as of may results of operations net interest income net interest income is our primary source of income its level is a function of the average balance of our interestearning assets the average balance of our interestbearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities these factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interestearning assets and our interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by various external factors including the local economy competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the fomc and market interest rates the cost of our deposits and borrowed funds is largely based on shortterm rates of interest the level of which is partially impacted by the actions of the fomc while the target federal funds rate generally impacts the cost of our shortterm borrowings and deposits the yields on our heldforinvestment loans and other interestearning assets are not as sensitive to intermediateterm market interest rates another factor that impacts the yields on our interestearning assetsand our net interest incomeis the income generated by our multifamily and cre loans and securities when they prepay since prepayment income is recorded as interest income an increase or decrease in its level will also be reflected in the average yields as applicable on our loans securities and interestearning assets and therefore in our net interest income our net interest rate spread and our net interest margin it should be noted that the level of prepayment income on loans recorded in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay during that time such activity is largely dependent on such external factors as current market conditions including real estate values and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates this impact is most prevalent in our multifamily portfolio in addition while a decline in market interest rates may trigger an increase in refinancing and therefore prepayment income so too may an increase in market interest rates it is not unusual for borrowers to lock in lower interest rates when they expect or see that market interest rates are rising rather than risk refinancing later at a still higher interest rate the impact of prepayments on the current quarter was minimal comparison to prior quarter net interest income for the three months ended march was million up million or percent compared to the three months ended december this quarters results include a fullquarters contribution from the flagstar acquisition compared to only a onemonth

originated for investment multifamily loans the multifamily loans we produce are primarily secured by nonluxury residential apartment buildings in new york city that feature rentregulated units and belowmarket rents the multifamily loan portfolio was billion at march down slightly compared to billion at december the slight decline during the current first quarter was due to a combination of higher interest rates and our loan diversification strategy the majority of our multifamily loans were secured by rental apartment buildings at march billion or percent of the companys total multifamily loan portfolio is secured by properties in new york state and therefore are subject to the new rent regulation laws the weighted average ltv of the nys rent regulated multifamily portfolio was percent as of march compared to a weighted average ltv of percent for the multifamily loan portfolio at december in addition to underwriting multifamily loans on the basis of the buildings income and condition we consider the borrowers credit history profitability and building management expertise borrowers are required to present evidence of their ability to repay the loan from the buildings current rent rolls their financial statements and related documents while a percentage of our multifamily loans are tenyear fixed rate credits the vast majority of our multifamily loans feature a term of ten or twelve years with a fixed rate of interest for the first five or seven years of the loan and an alternative rate of interest in years six through ten or eight through twelve the rate charged in the first five or seven years is generally based on intermediateterm interest rates plus a spread during the remaining years the loan resets to an annually adjustable rate that is indexed to cme term sofr plus a spread alternately the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that is tied to the fiveyear fixed advance rate of the fhlbny plus a spread the fixedrate option also requires the payment of one percentage point of the thenoutstanding loan balance in either case the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial fiveor sevenyear term as the rent roll increases the typical property owner seeks to refinance the mortgage and generally does so before the loan reprices in year six or eight multifamily loans that refinance within the first five or seven years are typically subject to an established prepayment penalty schedule depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the thencurrent loan balance if a loan extends past the fifth or seventh year and the borrower selects the fixedrate option the prepayment penalties typically reset to a range of five points to one point over years six through ten or eight through twelve for example a tenyear multifamily loan that prepays in year three would generally be expected to pay a prepayment penalty equal to three percentage points of the remaining principal balance a twelveyear multifamily loan that prepays in year one or two would generally be expected to pay a penalty equal to five percentage points because prepayment penalties are recorded as interest income they are reflected in the average yields on our loans and interestearning assets our net interest rate spread and net interest margin and the level of net interest income we record no assumptions are involved in the recognition of prepayment income as such income is recorded when the cash is received our success as a multifamily lender partly reflects the solid relationships we have developed with the markets leading mortgage brokers who are familiar with our lending practices our underwriting standards and our longstanding practice of basing our loans on the cash flows produced by the properties the process of producing such loans is generally four to six weeks in duration and because the multifamily market is largely brokerdriven the expense incurred in sourcing such loans is substantially reduced we believe our underwriting quality of multifamily lending is distinctive this reflects the nature of the buildings securing our loans our underwriting process and standards and the generally conservative ltv ratios our multifamily loans feature at origination historically a relatively small percentage of the multifamily loans that have transitioned to nonperforming status have resulted in actual losses even when the credit cycle has taken a downward turn we primarily underwrite our multifamily loans based on the current cash flows produced by the collateral property with a reliance on the income approach to appraising the properties rather than the sales approach we also consider a variety of other factors including the physical condition of the underlying property the net operating income of the mortgaged premises prior to debt service the dscr which is the ratio of the propertys net operating income to its debt service and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value ie the ltv of the property in addition to requiring a minimum dscr of percent on multifamily buildings we obtain a security interest in the personal property located on the premises and an assignment of rents and leases our multifamily loans generally represent no more than percent of the lower of the appraised value or the sales price of the underlying property and typically feature an amortization period of years in addition our multifamily loans may contain an initial interestonly period which typically does not exceed two years however these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis accordingly while our multifamily lending niche has not been immune to downturns in the credit cycle the limited number of losses we have recorded even in adverse credit cycles suggests that the multifamily loans we produce involve less credit risk than certain other types of loans in general buildings that are subject to rent regulation have tended to be stable with occupancy levels remaining more or less constant over time because the rents are typically below market and the buildings securing our loans are generally maintained in good condition they have been more likely to retain their tenants in adverse economic times in addition we exclude any shortterm property tax exemptions and abatement benefits the property owners receive when we underwrite our multifamily loans the following table presents a geographical analysis of the multifamily loans in our heldforinvestment loan

area refer to the geographical analysis table included below for additional details approximately billion of the cre portfolio are office properties with an average balance of approximately million and located primarily in the new york metro area there are no delinquencies or nonperforming loans with respect to this portfolio as of march the terms of more than half of our cre loans are similar to the terms of our multifamily credits which primarily feature a fixed rate of interest for the first five years of the loan that is generally based on intermediateterm interest rates plus a spread in addition to customary fixed rate terms we now also offer floating rates advances indexed to cme term sofr these products are generally offered in combination with interest rate cap or swaps that provide borrowers with additional optionality to manage their interest rate risk following the initial fixed rate period the loan resets to an adjustable interest rate that is indexed to cme term sofr plus a spread alternately the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that is tied to the fiveyear fixed advance rate of the fhlbny plus a spread the fixedrate option also requires the payment of an amount equal to one percentage point of the thenoutstanding loan balance in either case the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial five or sevenyear term prepayment penalties apply to certain of our cre loans as they do our multifamily credits depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the thencurrent loan balance if a loan extends past the fifth or seventh year and the borrower selects the fixed rate option the prepayment penalties typically reset to a range of five points to one point over years six through ten or eight through twelve the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties to minimize our credit risk we originate cre loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the propertys current income stream and dscr the approval of a loan also depends on the borrowers credit history profitability and expertise in property management and generally requires a minimum dscr of percent and a maximum ltv of percent in addition the origination of cre loans typically requires a security interest in the fixtures equipment and other personal property of the borrower andor an assignment of the rents andor leases in addition our cre loans may contain an interestonly period which typically does not exceed three years however these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis the

borrowers are required to provide a guarantee of repayment and completion in the three months ended march and march we did not have any adc loan losses that were recovered through a guarantee the risk of loss on an adc loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial appraisal of the propertys value upon completion of construction the developers experience the estimated cost of

lender to fund the closing of residential mortgage loans each extension advance or drawdown on the line is fully collateralized by residential mortgage loans and is paid off when the lender sells the loan to an outside investor or in some instances to the bank underlying mortgage loans are predominantly originated using the agencies underwriting standards the guideline for debt to tangible net worth is to we have billion outstanding warehouse loans to other mortgage lenders and have relationships in place to lend up to billion at our discretion the interest rates on our ci loans can be fixed or floating with floatingrate loans being tied to sofr prime or some other market index plus an applicable spread our floatingrate loans may or may not feature a floor rate of interest the

and industrial nm nm other loans nm total loans days past due a loan generally is classified as a nonaccrual loan when it is days or more past due or when it is deemed to be impaired because we no longer expect to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status we cease the accrual of interest owed and previously accrued interest is reversed and charged against interest income at march our nonperforming loans consisted of million of loans days or more past due and still accruing and million were nonaccrual loans at december all of our nonperforming loans were nonaccrual loans a loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is current and we have reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible we monitor nonaccrual loans both within and beyond our primary lending area in the same manner monitoring loans generally involves inspecting and reappraising the collateral properties holding discussions with the principals and managing agents of the borrowing entities and retain legal counsel as applicable requesting financial operating and rent roll information confirming that hazard insurance is in place or forceplacing such insurance monitoring tax payment status advancing funds as needed and seeking approval from the courts to appoint a receiver when necessary to protect the banks interests including to collect rents manage property operations and ensure maintenance of the collateral properties it is our policy to order updated appraisals for all nonperforming loans days or more past due irrespective of loan type that are collateralized by multifamily buildings cre properties or land if the most recent appraisal on file for the property is more than one year old appraisals are ordered annually until such time as the loan becomes performing and is returned to accrual status it is not our policy to obtain updated appraisals for performing loans however appraisals may be ordered for performing loans when a borrower requests an increase in the loan amount a modification in loan terms or an extension of a maturing loan the following table

percent compared to december repossessed assets of million were relatively unchanged compared to the million recorded in the prior quarter nonperforming loans are reviewed regularly by management and discussed on a monthly basis with the board credit committee and the board of directors of the bank as applicable in accordance with our chargeoff policy collateraldependent nonperforming loans are written down to their current appraised values less certain transaction costs workout specialists from our loan workout unit actively pursue borrowers who are delinquent in repaying their loans in an effort to collect payment in addition outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to institute such action with regard to such borrowers properties and other assets that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as repossessed assets and are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition less the estimated cost of selling the property subsequent declines in the fair value of the assets are charged to earnings and are included in noninterest expense it is our policy to require an appraisal and an environmental assessment of properties classified as oreo before foreclosure and to reappraise the properties on an asneeded basis and not less than annually until they are sold we dispose of such properties as quickly and prudently as possible given current market conditions and the propertys condition to mitigate the potential for credit losses we underwrite our loans in accordance with credit standards that we consider to be prudent in the case of multifamily and cre loans we look first at the consistency of the cash flows being generated by the property to determine its economic value using the income approach and then at the market value of the property that collateralizes the loan the amount of the loan is then based on the lower of the two values with the economic value more typically used the condition of the collateral property is another critical factor multifamily buildings and cre properties are inspected from rooftop to basement as a prerequisite to approval furthermore independent appraisers whose appraisals are carefully reviewed by our experienced inhouse appraisal officers and staff perform appraisals on collateral properties in addition we work with a select group of mortgage brokers who are familiar with our credit standards and whose track record with our lending officers is typically greater than ten years furthermore in new york city where the majority of the buildings securing our multifamily loans are located the rents that tenants may be charged on certain apartments are typically restricted under certain rentcontrol or rentstabilization laws as a result the rents that tenants pay for such apartments are generally lower than current market rents buildings with a preponderance of such rentregulated apartments are less likely to experience vacancies in times of economic adversity reflecting the strength of the underlying collateral for these loans and the collateral structure a relatively small percentage of our nonperforming multifamily loans have resulted in losses over time to further manage our credit risk our lending policies limit the amount of credit granted to any one borrower and typically require minimum dscrs of percent for multifamily loans and percent for cre loans although we typically lend up to percent of the appraised value on multifamily buildings and up to percent on commercial properties the average ltvs of such credits at origination were below those amounts at march exceptions to these ltv limitations are minimal and are reviewed on a casebycase basis the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties to minimize our credit risk we originate cre loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the propertys current income stream and dscr the approval of a cre loan also depends on the borrowers credit history profitability and expertise in property management given that our cre loans are underwritten in accordance with underwriting standards that are similar to those applicable to our multifamily credits the percentage of our nonperforming cre loans that have resulted in losses has been comparatively small over time multifamily and cre loans are generally originated at conservative ltvs and dscrs as previously stated low ltvs provide a greater likelihood of full recovery and reduce the possibility of incurring a severe loss on a credit in many cases they reduce the likelihood of the borrower walking away from the property although borrowers may default on loan payments they have a greater incentive to protect their equity in the collateral property and to return their loans to performing status with regard to adc loans we typically lend up to percent of the estimated ascompleted market value of multifamily and residential tract projects however in the case of home construction loans to individuals the limit is percent with respect to commercial construction loans we typically lend up to percent of the estimated ascompleted market value of the property credit risk is also managed through the loan disbursement process loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and as warranted by inspection reports provided to us by our own lending officers andor consulting engineers to minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing each of our credits is secured with a perfected first security interest or outright ownership in the underlying collateral and structured as senior debt or as a noncancellable lease to further minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing we reunderwrite each transaction in addition we retain outside counsel to conduct a further review of the underlying documentation other ci loans generally represent loans to commercial businesses which meet certain desired client characteristics and credit standards the credit standards for commercial borrowers are based on numerous criteria including historical and projected financial information strength of management acceptable collateral and market conditions and trends in the borrowers industry these loans are generally variable rate loans in which the interest rate fluctuates with a specified index rate the procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are generally consistent across all categories with late charges assessed and notices mailed to the borrower at specified dates we attempt to reach the borrower by telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment when contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure or recovery against collateral property we attempt to obtain full payment and will consider a repayment schedule to avoid taking such action delinquencies are addressed by our loan workout unit and every effort is made to collect rather than initiate foreclosure proceedings fair values for all multifamily buildings cre properties and land are determined based on the appraised value if an appraisal is more than one year old and the loan is classified as either nonperforming or as an accruing tdr then an updated appraisal is required to determine fair value estimated disposition costs are deducted from the fair value of the property to determine estimated net realizable value in the instance of an outdated appraisal on an impaired loan we adjust the original appraisal by using a thirdparty index value to determine the extent of impairment until an updated appraisal is received while we strive to originate loans that will perform fully adverse economic and market conditions among other factors can negatively impact a borrowers ability to repay historically our level of net chargeoffs has been relatively low in downward credit cycles even when the volume of nonperforming loans has increased for the three months ended march our net chargeoffs were zero as c ompared to net chargeoffs of million over the same period in the allowance for credit losses increased million equaling million at march from million at december the majority of the increase was related to the initial provision for credit losses of million for the acquired loans in the signature transaction and an million provision for loan losses primarily related to higher loan volume the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases represented percent of nonperforming loans at march as compared to percent at the prior yearend based upon all relevant and available information at march management believes that the allowance for losses on loans was appropriate at that date the following table presents information on the companys net chargeoffs as compared to average loans

dividends paid to the parent company by the bank capital raised through the issuance of securities funding raised through the issuance of debt instruments and repayments of and income from investment securities on a consolidated basis our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources retail institutional and brokered deposits borrowed funds primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans and cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities deposits our ability to retain and attract deposits depends on numerous factors including customer satisfaction the rates of interest we pay the types of products we offer and the attractiveness of their terms from time to time we have chosen not to compete actively for deposits depending on our access to deposits through acquisitions the availability of lowercost funding sources the impact of competition on pricing and the need to fund our loan demand the vast majority of our deposits are retail in nature ie they are deposits we have gathered through our branches or through business combinations depending on their availability and pricing relative to other funding sources we also include brokered deposits in our deposit mix brokered deposits accounted for billion of our deposits at the end of this march compared to billion at december brokered money market accounts represented billion of total brokered deposits at march and billion at december brokered interestbearing checking accounts represented billion and billion respectively at march we had 73billion of brokered cds compared to billion at december our uninsured deposits are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the fdic insurance limit currently these amounts were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting purposes and excludes internal accounts at march our deposit base includes billion of uninsured deposits a net

junior subordinated debentures and subordinated debt liquidity contractual obligations and offbalance sheet commitments and capital position liquidity we manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand we monitor our liquidity daily to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet our financial obligations our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents which totaled billion and billion at march and december respectively cash and cash equivalents were billion and billion at march and december respectively the billion increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to an increase in interestbearing deposits at the federal reserve bank to enhance and support shortterm liquidity our billion of total ready liquidity cash and cash equivalents unpledged securities and fed funds and fhlb borrowing capacity reflects a significant amount of liquid assets and sufficient sources of readilyavailable funds that can be accessed to meet its obligations and unanticipated needs as they arise additional liquidity stems from deposits and from our use of wholesale funding sources including wholesale borrowings and brokered deposits in addition we have access to the banks approved lines of credit with various counterparties including the fhlbny the availability of these wholesale funding sources is generally based on the amount of mortgage loan collateral available under a blanket lien we have pledged to the respective institutions and to a lesser extent the amount of available securities that may be pledged to collateralize our borrowings at march our available borrowing capacity with the fhlbny was billion i n addition the bank had availableforsale securities of billion of which billion is unpledged furthermore the bank has agreements with the frbny that enable it to access the discount window as a further means of enhancing our liquidity in connecti on with these agreements the bank has pledged certain loans and securities to collateralize any funds we may borrow the maximum amount the bank could borrow from the frbny was billion there were no borrowings against these lines of credit at march cds due to mature or reprice in one year or less from march totaled billion representing percent of total cds at that date our ability to attract and retain retail deposits including cds depends on numerous factors including among others the convenience of our branches and our other banking channels our customers satisfaction with the service they receive the rates of interest we offer the types of products we feature and the attractiveness of their terms our decision to compete for deposits also depends on numerous factors including among others our access to deposits through acquisitions the availability of lowercost funding sources the impact of competition on pricing and the need to fund our loan demand the parent company is a separate legal entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity at march the parent company held cash and cash equivalents of million in addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases the parent company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to our stockholders as a delaware corporation the parent company is able to pay dividends either from surplus or in case there is no surplus from net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year various legal restrictions limit the extent to which the companys subsidiary bank can supply funds to the parent company and its nonbank subsidiaries the bank would require the approval of the occ if the dividends it declares in any calendar year were to exceed the total of its respective net profits for that year combined with its respective retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years less any required transfer to paidin capital the term net profits is defined as net income for a given period less any dividends paid during that period as a result of our acquisition of flagstar we are also required to seek regulatory approval from the occ for the payment of any dividend to the parent company through at least the period ending november in connection with receiving regulatory approval from the occ for the signature transaction the bank has committed that i for a period of two years from the date of the signature transaction it will not declare or pay any dividend without receiving a prior written determination of no supervisory objection from the occ and ii it will not declare or pay dividends on the amount of retained earnings that represents any net bargain purchase gain that is subject to a conditional period that may be imposed by the occ in dividends of million were paid by the bank to the parent company at march the bank could have paid additional dividends of billion to the parent company without regulatory approval at march we believe the company has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations over the next months and for the foreseeable future contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business we enter into a variety of contractual obligations in order to manage our assets and liabilities fund loan growth operate our branch network and address our capital needs for example we offer cds with contractual terms to our customers and borrow funds under contract from the fhlbny these contractual obligations are reflected in the consolidated statements of condition under deposits and borrowed funds respectively at march we had cds of billion and longterm debt defined as borrowed funds with an original maturity one year or more of billion we also are obligated under certain noncancelable operating leases on the buildings and land we use in operating our branch network and in performing our backoffice responsibilities these obligations are included in the consolidated statements of condition and totaled million at march at march we also had commitments to extend credit in the form of mortgage and other loan originations as well as commercial performance standby and financial standby letters of credit these commitments consist of agreements to extend credit as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract under which the loan is made commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee the following table summarizes the companys commitments to originate loans and letters of credit in millions march december multifamily and commercial real estate onetofour family including interest rate locks acquisition development and construction warehouse loan commitments other loan commitments total loan commitments commercial performance standby and financial standby letters of credit total commitments the letters of credit we issue consist of performance standby financial standby and commercial letters of credit financial standby letters of credit primarily are issued for the benefit of other financial institutions municipalities or landlords on behalf of certain of our current borrowers and obligate us to guarantee payment of a specified financial obligation performance standby letters of credit are primarily issued for the benefit of local municipalities on behalf of certain of our borrowers performance letters of credit obligate us to make payments in the event that a specified third party fails to perform under nonfinancial contractual obligations commercial letters of credit act as a means of ensuring payment to a seller upon shipment of goods to a buyer although commercial letters of credit are used to effect payment for domestic transactions the majority are used to settle payments in international trade typically such letters of credit require the presentation of documents that describe the commercial transaction and provide evidence of shipment and the transfer of title the fees we collect in connection with the issuance of letters of credit are included in fee income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income based upon our current liquidity position and ready liquidity of billion we expect that our funding will be sufficient to fulfill these cash obligations and commitments when they are due both in the short term and long term for the three months ended march we did not engage in any offbalance sheet transactions that we expect to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows at march we had no commitments to purchase securities regulatory capital the bank is subject to regulation examination and supervision by the occ and the federal reserve the regulators the bank is also governed by numerous federal and state laws and regulations including the fdic improvement act of which established five categories of capital adequacy ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized such classifications are used by the fdic to determine various matters including prompt corrective action and each institutions fdic deposit insurance premium assessments capital amounts and classifications are also subject to the regulators qualitative judgments about the components of capital and risk weightings among other factors the quantitative measures established to ensure capital adequacy require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of leverage capital to average assets and of common equity tier capital tier capital and total capital to riskweighted assets as such measures are defined in the regulations at march our capital measures continued to exceed the minimum federal requirements for a bank holding company and for a bank the following table sets forth our common equity tier tier

financial institution we are focused on reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility which represents our primary market risk changes in market interest rates represent the greatest challenge to our financial performance as such changes can have a significant impact on the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and on the market value of all interestearning assets other than those possessing a short term to maturity to reduce our exposure to changing rates the board of directors and management monitor interest rate sensitivity on a regular or as needed basis so that adjustments to the asset and liability mix can be made when deemed appropriate the actual duration of heldforinvestment mortgage loans and mortgagerelated securities can be significantly impacted by changes in prepayment levels and market interest rates the level of prepayments may in turn be impacted by a variety of factors including the economy in the region where the underlying mortgages were originated seasonal factors demographic variables and the assumability of the underlying mortgages however the factors with the most significant impact on prepayments are market interest rates and the availability of refinancing opportunities we managed our interest rate risk by taking the following actions we have continued to emphasize the origination and retention of intermediateterm assets primarily in the form of multifamily and cre loans we have continued the origination of certain ci loans that feature floating interest rates increased the focus on retaining low costs deposits and obtained new low cost deposits as part of the bankingasaservice initiative the use of derivatives to manage our interest rate position uninsured deposits we manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand as a result we have billion of total ready liquidity cash and cash equivalents unpledged securities and fed funds and fhlb borrowing capacity which all together exceed our level of uninsured deposits our uninsured deposits are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the fdic insurance limit currently these amounts were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting purposes and excludes internal accounts at march our deposit base includes billion of uninsured deposits a net increase of billion as compared to december due to the signature transaction this represents percent of our total deposits libor transition process and phase out the company has certain loans interest rate swap agreements investment securities and debt obligations whose interest rate is indexed to libor in the fca which is responsible for regulating libor announced that the publication of libor is not guaranteed beyond in december the administrator of libor announced its intention to i cease the publication of the oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor after december and ii cease the publication of all other tenors of us dollar libor one three six and 12month libor after june and on march announced that it will permanently cease to publish most libor settings beginning on january and cease to publish the overnight onemonth threemonth sixmonth and 12month us dollar libor settings on july accordingly the fca has stated that it does not intend to persuade or compel banks to submit to libor after such respective dates until such time however fca panel banks have agreed to continue to support libor in october the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a joint statement on managing the libor transition that offered their regulatory expectations and outlined potential supervisory and enforcement consequences for banks that fail to adequately plan for and implement the transition away from libor the failure to properly transition away from libor may result in increased supervisory scrutiny the implementation of a substitute index for the calculation of interest rates under the companys loan agreements may result in disputes or litigation with counterparties over the appropriateness or comparability to libor of the substitute index which would have an adverse effect on the companys results of operations even when robust fallback language is included there can be no assurances that the replacement rate plus any spread adjustment will be economically equivalent to libor which could result in a lower interest rate being paid to the company on such assets the alternative reference rates committee a group of privatemarket participants convened by the frb and the frbny has identified sofr as the recommended alternative to libor the use of sofr as a substitute for libor is voluntary and may not be suitable for all market participants sofr is calculated and observed differently than libor given the manner in which sofr is calculated it is likely to be lower than libor and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions market practices related to sofr calculation conventions continue to develop and may vary inconsistent calculation conventions among financial products may expose is to increased basic rate and resultant costs other alternatives to libor also exist but because of the difference in how those alternatives are constructed they may diverge significantly from libor in a range of situations and market conditions the bank established a subcommittee of alco to address issues related to the phase out and transition from libor this subcommittee consists of personnel from various departments through the bank including lending loan administration credit risk management financetreasury including interest rate risk and liquidity management information technology and operations the company has liborbased contracts that extend beyond june the subcommittee has monitored the banks libor transition progress and substantially all contracts have been updated in complying with industry requirements the bank has not offered new liborbased products since december interest rate sensitivity analysis interest rate sensitivity is monitored through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in our economic value of equity eve over a range of interest rate scenarios eve is defined as the net present value of expected cash flows from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet contracts the eve ratio under any interest rate scenario is defined as the eve in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario the model assumes estimated loan and mbs prepayment rates current market value spreads and deposit decay rates and betas based on the information and assumptions in effect at march the following table sets forth our eve assuming the changes in interest rates noted change in interest rates in basis points estimated percentage change in economic value of equity over one year over one year over one year over one year the net changes in eve presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the boards of directors of the company and the bank accordingly while the eve analysis provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and may very well differ from actual results interest rate risk is also monitored through the use of a model that generates net interest income nii simulations over a range of interest rate scenarios modeling changes in nii requires that certain assumptions be made which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates in this regard the nii analysis presented below assumes that the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities furthermore the model does not take into account the benefit of any strategic actions we may take to further reduce our exposure to interest rate risk the assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the following table due to the frequency timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories and prepayments among other factors coupled with any actions taken to counter the effects of any such changes based on the information and assumptions in effect at march the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in future net interest income for the next twelve months assuming the changes in interest rates noted change in interest rates in basis points estimated percentage change in future net interest income over one year over one year over one year over one year in general short and longterm rates are assumed to increase in parallel instantaneously and then remain unchanged the net changes in nii presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the boards of directors of the company and the bank future changes in our mix of assets and liabilities may result in greater changes to our eve andor nii simulations in the event that our eve and net interest income sensitivities were to breach our internal policy limits we would undertake the following actions to ensure that appropriate remedial measures were put in place in formulating appropriate strategies the alco committee would ascertain the primary causes of the variance from policy tolerances the expected term of such conditions and the projected effect on capital and earnings our alco committee would inform the board of directors of the variance and present recommendations to the board regarding proposed courses of action to restore conditions to withinpolicy tolerances where temporary changes in market conditions or volume
