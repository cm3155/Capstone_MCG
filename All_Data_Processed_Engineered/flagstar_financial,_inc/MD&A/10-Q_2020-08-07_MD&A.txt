item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the purpose of this quarterly report on we did not have any potential problem loans at the end of the current first quarter that would have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of a borrower to comply with present loan repayment terms and that would have resulted in such disclosure if that were the case loan deferrals under us gaap banks are required to assess modifications to a loans terms for potential classification as a tdr a loan to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty is classified as a tdr when a lender grants a concession that it would otherwise not consider such as a payment deferral or interest concession in order to encourage banks to work with impacted borrowers the cares act and bank regulators have provided relief from tdr accounting the main benefits of tdr relief include a capital benefit in the form of reduced riskweighted assets as tdrs are more heavily riskweighted for capital purposes aging of the loans is frozen ie they will continue to be reported in the same delinquency bucket they were in at the time of modification and the loans are generally not reported as nonaccrual during the modification period under the cares act the company made the election to deem that loan modifications do not result in tdrs if they are related to the novel coronavirus disease covid19 executed on a loan that was not more than days past due as of december and executed between march and the earlier of a days after the date of termination of the national emergency or b december the company has implemented various loan modification programs with some of its borrowers mainly payment deferrals for a sixmonth period the tables

period is typically for a period of up to six months with the ability to extend again at the end of the deferral period at the banks discretion additionally the bank entered into billion of principalonly deferrals with borrowers under essentially the same terms as the fullpayment deferral program except that these borrowers are paying the interest due each month on their loans while deferring the principal including these principalonly deferrals total multifamily and cre deferrals were billion at june or of the respective portfolios at june total payment deferrals for the entire

comprehensive income reflecting an increase in the cash surrender value of the underlying policies our investment in boli increased million to billion at june compared to billion at december goodwill we record goodwill in our consolidated statements of condition in connection with certain of our business combinations goodwill which is tested at least annually for impairment refers to the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of an acquired companys assets net of the liabilities assumed goodwill totaled billion at both june and december for more information about the companys goodwill see the discussion of critical accounting policies earlier in this report sources of funds the parent company ie the company on an unconsolidated basis has three primary funding sources for the payment of dividends share repurchases and other corporate uses dividends paid to the company by the bank capital raised through the issuance of stock and funding raised through the issuance of debt instruments on a consolidated basis our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources deposits borrowed funds primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings the cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans and the cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities loan repayments and sales totaled billion in the six months ended june up billion from the billion recorded in the yearearlier six months cash flows from the repayment and sales of securities totaled billion and million respectively in the corresponding periods while purchases of securities totaled million and million respectively deposits our ability to retain and attract deposits depends on numerous factors including customer satisfaction the rates of interest we pay the types of products we offer and the attractiveness of their terms from time to time we have chosen not to compete actively for deposits depending on our access to deposits through acquisitions the availability of lowercost funding sources the impact of competition on pricing and the need to fund our loan demand at june our deposits totaled billion up million or annualized compared to the level at december at the end of the current second quarter total deposits represented of total assets while cds represented of our total deposits included in the june balance of deposits were institutional deposits of billion and municipal deposits of million as compared to billion and million respectively at december brokered deposits rose million during the second quarter of the year to billion reflecting a billion increase in brokered money market accounts to billion and a million decrease in brokered cds to billion in addition at june we had billion of brokered interest bearing checking accounts a decrease of million from december the extent to which we accept brokered deposits depends on various factors including the availability and pricing of such wholesale funding sources and the availability and pricing of other sources of funds borrowed funds borrowed funds consist primarily of wholesale borrowings ie fhlbny advances repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased and to a far lesser extent junior subordinated debentures as of june the balance of borrowed funds increased million from yearend to billion representing of total assets at that date the majority of the increase was related to a greater level of wholesale borrowings wholesale borrowings rose million from the yearend amount to billion fhlbny advances increased million since december to billion while the balance of repurchase agreements was million at june unchanged from the balance at december subordinated notes on november the company issued million aggregate principal amount of its fixedtofloating rate subordinated notes due the company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes which may include opportunistic repurchases of shares of its common stock pursuant to its previously announced share repurchase program the notes were offered to the public at of their face amount at june the balance of subordinated notes was million which excludes certain costs related to their issuance junior subordinated debentures junior subordinated debentures totaled million at june comparable to the balance at december risk definitions the following section outlines the definitions of interest rate risk market risk and liquidity risk and how the company manages market and interest rate risk interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movements in interest rates interest rate risk arises from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows repricing risk from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting company activities basis risk from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities yield curve risk and from interestrelated options embedded in a banks products options risk the evaluation of interest rate risk must consider the impact of complex illiquid hedging strategies or products and also the potential impact on fee income eg prepayment income which is sensitive to changes in interest rates in those situations where trading is separately managed this refers to structural positions and not trading portfolios market risk market risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from changes in the value of portfolios of financial instruments this risk arises from marketmaking dealing and positiontaking activities in interest rate foreign exchange equity and commodities markets many banks use the term price risk interchangeably with market risk this is because market risk focuses on the changes in market factors eg interest rates market liquidity and volatilities that affect the value of traded instruments the primary accounts affected by market risk are those which are revalued for financial presentation eg trading accounts for securities derivatives and foreign exchange products liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from a banks inability to meet its obligations when they become due without incurring unacceptable losses liquidity risk includes the inability to manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources liquidity risk also arises from a banks failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect the ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value management of market and interest rate risk we manage our assets and liabilities to reduce our exposure to changes in market interest rates the asset and liability management process has three primary objectives to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts to determine the appropriate level of risk given our business strategy risk appetite operating environment capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and to manage that risk in a manner consistent with guidelines approved by the boards of directors of the company and the bank market and interest rate risk as a financial institution we are focused on reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility changes in interest rates pose the greatest challenge to our financial performance as such changes can have a significant impact on the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and on the market value of all interestearning assets other than those possessing a short term to maturity to reduce our exposure to changing rates the boards of directors and management monitor interest rate sensitivity on a regular or as needed basis so that adjustments to the asset and liability mix can be made when deemed appropriate the actual duration of heldforinvestment mortgage loans and mortgagerelated securities can be significantly impacted by changes in prepayment levels and market interest rates the level of prepayments may be impacted by a variety of factors including the economy in the region where the underlying mortgages were originated seasonal factors demographic variables and the assumability of the underlying mortgages however the largest determinants of prepayments are interest rates and the availability of refinancing opportunities we managed our interest rate risk by taking the following actions we continued to emphasize the origination and retention of intermediateterm assets primarily in the form of multifamily and cre loans we continued the origination of certain ci loans that feature floating interest rates we replaced maturing wholesale borrowings with longer term borrowings including some with callable features and we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of billion to hedge certain real estate loans libor transition process on july the uk financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after the frb established the alternative reference rate committee arrc comprised of a group of private market participants and other members representing banks and financial sector regulators to identify a set of alternative reference rates for potential use as benchmarks the arrc has recommended the secured overnight financing rate or sofr as the preferred alternative rate to us dollar libor the bank has established a subcommittee of its alco to address issues related to the phaseout and ultimate transition away from libor to an alternate rate this subcommittee is led by our chief accounting officer and consists of personnel from various departments throughout the bank including lending loan administration credit risk management financetreasury including interest rate risk and liquidity management information technology and operations the company has liborbased contracts that extend beyond included in loans and leases securities wholesale borrowings derivative financial instruments and longterm debt the subcommittee has reviewed contract fallback language and noted that certain contracts will need updated provisions for the transition and is coordinating with impacted business lines while the arrc has recommended sofr as the replacement for libor there is acknowledgment that the development of a credit sensitive element could be a complement to sofr at this time it is unclear as to the likelihood and timing of this occurring but such a development could have an impact on our transition efforts interest rate sensitivity analysis the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a banks interest rate sensitivity gap an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time frame if it will mature or reprice within that period of time the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interestearning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time frame and the amount of interestbearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same period of time in a rising interest rate environment an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected absent the effects of other factors to experience a greater increase in the cost of its interestbearing liabilities than it would in the yield on its interestearning assets thus producing a decline in its net interest income conversely in a declining rate environment an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected to experience a lesser reduction in the yield on its interestearning assets than it would in the cost of its interestbearing liabilities thus producing an increase in its net interest income in a rising interest rate environment an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to experience a greater increase in the yield on its interestearning assets than it would in the cost of its interestbearing liabilities thus producing an increase in its net interest income conversely in a declining rate environment an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to experience a lesser reduction in the cost of its interestbearing liabilities than it would in the yield on its interestearning assets thus producing a decline in its net interest income at june our oneyear gap was a negative compared to a negative at march and a negative at december the change in our oneyear gap from december primarily reflects a decrease in cds and borrowings maturing within one year the table on the following page sets forth the amounts of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities outstanding at june which based on certain assumptions stemming from our historical experience are expected to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown except as stated below the amounts of assets and liabilities shown as repricing or maturing during a particular time period were determined in accordance with the earlier of the term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability the table provides an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at june on the basis of contractual maturities anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments within a threemonth period and subsequent selected time intervals for residential mortgagerelated securities prepayment rates are forecasted at a weighted average cpr of per annum for multifamily and cre loans prepayment rates are forecasted at weighted average cprs of and per annum respectively borrowed funds were not assumed to prepay savings interest bearing checking and money market accounts were assumed to decay based on a comprehensive statistical analysis that incorporated our historical deposit experience based on the results of this analysis savings accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of for the first five years and for years six through ten interestbearing checking accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of for the first five years and for years six through ten the decay assumptions reflect the prolonged low interest rate environment and the uncertainty regarding future depositor behavior including those accounts having specified repricing dates money market accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of for the first five years and for years six through ten at june  in thousands three months or less four to twelve months more than one year to three years more than three years to five years more than five years to years more than years total interestearning assets mortgage and other loans mortgagerelated securities other securities interestearning cash and cash equivalents total interestearning assets interestbearing liabilities interestbearing checking and money market accounts savings accounts certificates of deposit borrowed funds total interestbearing liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap per period cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets cumulative net interestearning assets as a percentage of net interestbearing liabilities for the purpose of the gap analysis nonperforming loans and the allowances for loan losses have been excluded mortgagerelated and other securities including fhlb stock are shown at their respective carrying amounts expected amount based in part on historical experience the interest rate sensitivity gap per period represents the difference between interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities prepayment and deposit decay rates can have a significant impact on our estimated gap while we believe our assumptions to be reasonable there can be no assurance that the assumed prepayment and decay rates will approximate actual future loan and securities prepayments and deposit withdrawal activity to validate our prepayment assumptions for our multifamily and cre loan portfolios we perform a monthly analysis during which we review our historical prepayment rates and compare them to our projected prepayment rates we continually review the actual prepayment rates to ensure that our projections are as accurate as possible since prepayments on these types of loans are not as closely correlated to changes in interest rates as prepayments on onetofour family loans tend to be in addition we review the call provisions if any in our borrowings and investment portfolios and on a monthly basis compare the actual calls to our projected calls to ensure that our projections are reasonable as of june the impact of a bp decline in market interest rates for our loans would have increased our projected prepayment rates for multifamily and cre loans by a constant prepayment rate of per annum conversely the impact of a bp increase in market interest rates would have decreased our projected prepayment rates for multifamily and cre loans by a constant prepayment rate o f per annum certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding interest rate sensitivity analysis for example although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of the market while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates additionally certain assets such as adjustablerate loans have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a shortterm basis and over the life of the asset furthermore in the event of a change in interest rates prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in calculating the table also the ability of some borrowers to repay their adjustablerate loans may be adversely impacted by an increase in market interest rates interest rate sensitivity is also monitored through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in our economic vale of equity eve over a range of interest rate scenarios eve is defined as the net present value of expected cash flows from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet contracts the eve ratio under any interest rate scenario is defined as the eve in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario the model assumes estimated loan prepayment rates reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates similar to those utilized in formulating the preceding interest rate sensitivity analysis based on the information and assumptions in effect at june the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in our eve assuming the changes in interest rates noted change in interest rates in basis points estimated percentage change in economic value of equity the impact of a bp and a bp reduction in interest rates is not presented in view of the current level of the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates the net changes in eve presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the boards of directors of the company and the bank as with the interest rate sensitivity analysis certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the preceding interest rate risk measurements modeling changes in eve requires that certain assumptions be made which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates in this regard the eve analysis presented above assumes that the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities furthermore the model does not take into account the benefit of any strategic actions we may take to further reduce our exposure to interest rate risk accordingly while the eve analysis provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and may very well differ from actual results we also utilize an internal net interest income simulation to manage our sensitivity to interest rate risk the simulation incorporates various marketbased assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on future levels of our financial assets and liabilities the assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the following table due to the frequency timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories and prepayments among other factors coupled with any actions taken to counter the effects of any such changes based on the information and assumptions in effect at june the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in future net interest income for the next twelve months assuming the changes in interest rates noted change in interest rates in basis points estimated percentage change in future net interest income in general short and longterm rates are assumed to increase in parallel fashion across all four quarters and then remain unchanged the impact of a bp and a bp reduction in interest rates is not presented in view of the current level of the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates future changes in our mix of assets and liabilities may result in greater changes to our gap npv andor net interest income simulation in the event that our eve and net interest income sensitivities were to breach our internal policy limits we would undertake the following actions to ensure that appropriate remedial measures were put in place our alco committee would inform the board of directors of the variance and present recommendations to the board regarding proposed courses of action to restore conditions to withinpolicy tolerances in formulating appropriate strategies the alco committee would ascertain the primary causes of the variance from policy tolerances the expected term of such conditions and the projected effect on capital and earnings where temporary changes in market conditions or volume levels result in significant increases in risk strategies may involve reducing open positions or employing synthetic hedging techniques to more immediately reduce risk exposure where variance from policy tolerances is triggered by more fundamental imbalances in the risk profiles of core loan and deposit products a remedial strategy may involve restoring balance through natural hedges to the extent possible before employing synthetic hedging techniques other strategies might include asset restructuring involving sales of assets having higher risk profiles or a gradual restructuring of the asset mix over time to affect the maturity or repricing schedule of assets liability restructuring whereby product offerings and pricing are altered or wholesale borrowings are employed to affect the maturity structure or repricing of liabilities expansion or shrinkage of the balance sheet to correct imbalances in the repricing or maturity periods between assets and liabilities andor use or alteration of offbalance sheet positions including interest rate swaps caps floors options and forward purchase or sales commitments in connection with our net interest income simulation modeling we also evaluate the impact of changes in the slope of the yield curve at june our analysis indicated that an immediate inversion of the yield curve would be expected to result in a decrease in net interest income conversely an immediate steepening of the yield curve would be expected to result in a increase in net interest income it should be noted that the yield curve changes in these scenarios were updated given the changing market rate environment which resulted in an increase in the income sensitivity liquidity we manage our liquidity to ensure that cash flows are sufficient to support our operations and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand we monitor our liquidity daily to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet our financial obligations our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents which totaled billion and million respectively at june and december as in the past our portfolios of loans and securities provided liquidity in the first six months of the year with cash flows from the repayment and sale of loans totaling billion and cash flows from the repayment and sale of securities totaling b illion additional liquidity stems from the retail institutional and municipal deposits we gather and from our use of wholesale funding sources including brokered deposits and wholesale borrowings we also have access to the banks approved lines of credit with various counterparties including the fhlbny the availability of these wholesale funding sources is generally based on the available amount of mortgage loan collateral under a blanket lien we have pledged to the respective institutions and to a lesser extent the available amount of securities that may be pledged to collateralize our borrowings at june our available borrowing capacity with the fhlbny was billion in addition the bank had billion of availableforsale securities at that date of which billion was unencumbered furthermore the bank has an agreement with the frbny that enables it to access the discount window as a further means of enhancing liquidity if need be in connection with the agreement the bank has pledged certain loans and securities to collateralize any funds that may be borrowed at june the maximum amount the bank could borrow from the frbny was billion there were no borrowings outstanding at that date our primary investing activity is loan production in the first six months of the volume of loans originated for investment was billion during this time the net cash used in investing activities totaled million our operating activities provided net cash of million while the net cash provided by our financing activities totaled million cds due to mature in one year or less as of june totaled billion representing of total cds at that date our ability to retain these cds and to attract new deposits depends on numerous factors including customer satisfaction the rates of interest we pay on our deposits the types of products we offer and the attractiveness of their terms however there are times when we may choose not to compete for such deposits depending on the availability of lowercost funding the competitiveness of the market and its impact on pricing and our need for such deposits to fund loan demand as previously discussed the parent company is a separate legal entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity in addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases the parent company is responsible for paying dividends declared to our shareholders as a delaware corporation the parent company is able to pay dividends either from surplus or in case there is no surplus from net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year the parent companys ability to pay dividends may also depend in part upon dividends it receives from the bank the ability of the community bank to pay dividends and other capital distributions to the parent company is generally limited by new york state banking law and regulations and by certain regulations of the fdic in addition the superintendent of the new york state department of financial services the superintendent the fdic and the frb for reasons of safety and soundness may prohibit the payment of dividends that are otherwise permissible by regulations under new york state banking law a new york statechartered stockform savings bank or commercial bank may declare and pay dividends out of its net profits unless there is an impairment of capital however the approval of the superintendent is required if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of a banks net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years in the six months ended june the bank paid dividends totaling million to the parent company leaving million they could dividend to the parent company without regulatory approval at that date additional sources of liquidity available to the parent company at june included million in cash and cash equivalents if the bank was to apply to the superintendent for approval to make a dividend or capital distribution in excess of the dividend amounts permitted under the regulations there can be no assurance that such application would be approved capital position on march we issued  of preferred stock the offering generated capital of million net of underwriting and other issuance costs for general corporate purposes with the bulk of the proceeds being distributed to the community bank on october the company announced that it had received regulatory approval to repurchase its common stock accordingly the board of directors approved a million common share repurchase program the repurchase program was funded through the issuance of a like amount of subordinated notes as of june the company has repurchased a total of million shares at an average price of or an aggregate purchase price of million leaving million remaining under the current authorization stockholders equity common stockholders equity and tangible common stockholders equity include aocl which decreased million from the balance at the end of last year and decreased from the yearago quarter to million at june the yeartodate decrease was primarily the result of a million change in the net unrealized gain loss on availableforsale securities net of tax and a million decrease in the net unrealized loss on cash flow hedges net of tax to million regulatory capital in march as part of the response to the covid19 pandemic the federal banking agencies announced an interim final rule cecl ifr that provides banking organizations as an alternative to the cecl transition election an optional fiveyear transition period to phase in the impact of cecl on regulatory capital the cecl transition election the cecl ifr became effective as of march pursuant to the cecl ifr banking organizations may elect to delay the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital and then phase in the estimated cumulative impact of the initial twoyear delay over the next three years the estimated cumulative impact of cecl which will be phased in during the threeyear transition period includes the aftertax impact of adopting the cecl standard and the estimated impact of cecl in the initial two years thereafter the cecl ifr introduced a uniform scaling factor of for estimating the impact of cecl during the initial two years the scaling factor is an approximation of the impact of differences in credit loss allowances reflected under the cecl standard versus the incurred loss methodology the company has elected to delay the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital at june our capital measures continued to exceed the minimum federal requirements for a bank holding company and for a bank the following table sets forth our common equity

march and up compared to the million we reported for the three months ended june net income available to common shareholders for the three months ended june totaled million also up compared to the million we reported for the three months ended march and up compared to the million reported for the three months ended june on a per share basis the company reported diluted earnings per common share of for the second quarter of up when compared to the we reported in the previous quarter and up compared to the reported for the second quarter of net interest income net interest income is our primary source of income its level is a function of the average balance of our interestearning assets the average balance of our interestbearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities these factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interestearning assets and our interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by various external factors including the local economy competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the fomc and market interest rates net interest income is also influenced by the level of prepayment income primarily generated in connection with the prepayment of our multifamily and cre loans as well as securities since prepayment income is recorded as interest income an increase or decrease in its level will also be reflected in the average yields as applicable on our loans securities and interestearning assets and therefore in our interest rate spread and net interest margin it should be noted that the level of prepayment income on loans recorded in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay during that time such activity is largely dependent on such external factors as current market conditions including real estate values and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates in addition while a decline in market interest rates may trigger an increase in refinancing and therefore prepayment income so too may an increase in market interest rates it is not unusual for borrowers to lock in lower interest rates when they expect or see that market interest rates are rising rather than risk refinancing later at a still higher interest rate linkedquarter and yearoveryear comparison both the yearoveryear and sequential improvement in our net interest income was primarily attributable to a decrease in the companys cost of funds leading to a lower level of interest expense the decrease in funding costs is a result of the fomc lowering its federal funds target rate three times during and lowering it again during the month of march to near zero this was slightly offset by lower yields on our loan portfolio and in the securities portfolio details of the increase in net interest income follow interest income of million declined compared to the previous quarter and declined compared to the yearago quarter interest income on mortgage and other loans and leases was million down on a linkedquarter basis and down on a yearoveryear basis interest income on securities and money market instruments totaled million down compared to the previous quarter and down compared to the yearago quarter the decline in interest income on loans was the result of lower yields on our loans on both a sequential and yearoveryear basis while average loan balances increased over the same time periods the decline in interest income on securities on a sequential and yearoveryear basis was due to both lower yields and lower balances interest expense totaled million down on a linked quarter basis and down on a yearoveryear basis this was largely due to a decline in our cost of deposits and to a lesser extent our cost of borrowings the cost of interestbearing deposits declined significantly on both a linkedquarter and yearoveryear basis while the average balance remained relatively unchanged most of the decline was in the average cost of cds the average cost of borrowings also declined given the drop in market interest rates while the average balances increased modestly on a yearoveryear basis and remained relatively flat sequentially net interest margin the direction of the companys net interest margin was consistent with that of its net interest income and generally was driven by the same factors as those described above at the margin was bps higher than the trailingquarter measure and bps higher than the margin recorded in the second quarter of last year the following table summarizes the contribution of loan and securities prepayment income on the companys interest income and net interest margin in the periods noted for the three months ended june compared to june mar june mar june

which excludes the contribution of prepayment income is not nevertheless management uses this nongaap measure in its analysis of our performance and believes that this nongaap measure should be disclosed in this report and other investor communications for the following reasons adjusted net interest margin gives investors a better understanding of the effect of prepayment income on our net interest margin prepayment income in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay or securities that prepay during that period such activity is largely dependent on external factors such as current market conditions including real estate values and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates adjusted net interest margin is among the measures considered by current and prospective investors both independent of and in comparison with our peers adjusted net interest margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net
