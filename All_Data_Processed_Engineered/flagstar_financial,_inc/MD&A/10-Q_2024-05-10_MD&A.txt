and diluted eps included goodwill impairment of billion net income for the three months ended march included a bargain purchase gain of billion arising from the signature transaction net interest income net interest income is our primary source of income its level is a function of the average balance of our interestearning assets the average balance of our interestbearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities these factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interestearning assets and our interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by various external factors including the local economy competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the fomc and market interest rates the cost of our deposits and borrowed funds is largely based on shortterm rates of interest the level of which is partially impacted by the actions of the fomc while the target federal funds rate generally impacts the cost of our shortterm borrowings and deposits the yields on our heldforinvestment loans and other interestearning assets are not as sensitive to intermediateterm market interest rates from december to march we experienced billion in core deposit runoff following the rating agency downgrades of our companys credit ratings in february and march on march we announced a billion capital raise after which deposits stabilized and runoff was immaterial for the remainder of the first quarter we funded the deposit runoff and increased our on balance sheet liquidity primarily through billion in brokered cds and billion of wholesale borrowings the following table sets forth certain information regarding our net interest income and average balance sheet for the periods indicated average yields are

margin for the three months ended march was percent down basis points compared to the three months ended december the reduction is primarily driven by higher cost of funds with the average rate on borrowings costs increasing basis points and the impact from a deposit mix shift from lower cost interestbearing checking and mma to higher cost certificates of deposits the decline in lower rate deposits was primarily driven by withdrawals of uninsured deposits following the rating agency downgrades of our companys credit ratings in february and march these elevated withdrawals of uninsured deposits resulted in us raising liquidity through the use of higher cost deposits and borrowings subsequent to announcing a billion capital investment on march our deposits stabilized and then remained around billion for the remainder of the first quarter down from billion at december net interest income for the three months ended march was million down million or percent compared to the

deposits increased million to million during the three months ended march driven by a basis point increase in the average cost of interestbearing deposits due to the impact from a deposit mix shift from lower cost interestbearing checking and mma to higher cost certificates of deposits interest income on loans and leases decreased million primarily driven by a billion or reduction in average

year to date for the three months ended march the net interest margin was percent down basis points compared to the three months ended march the yearoveryear decrease was primarily the impact of

higher earning asset yields which increased basis points for the three months ended march net interest income totaled million up million or percent compared to million for the three months ended march the yearoveryear increase was primarily the result of the following interest income on mortgages and other loans increased million driven by a billion or percent increase in average loan balances to billion this is primarily driven by the current period including a full quarter of the signature transaction that closed on march additionally we had a basis point increase in the average loan yield to percent in the current quarter due primarily to the impact of rising rates and the higher yield of our portfolio due to loans acquired in the signature transaction interest income on securities increased million driven by a basis point increase in the average yield to percent from percent additionally there was a million or percent increase in the average securities balance to billion the

offset by interest expense on average interestbearing deposits increased million to million during the three months ended march average interest earning deposits grew billion or percent to billion

relatively flat for the three months ended march as compared to the three months ended december fdic servicing income declined million from million in the fourth quarter of to million in the first

loan portfolio was billion at march down slightly compared to billion at december due to a combination of higher interest rates and our loan diversification strategy the majority of our multifamily loans are secured by rental apartment buildings at march billion or percent of the companys total multifamily loan portfolio is secured by properties in new york state many of which are subject to rent regulation laws to varying degrees the weighted average ltv of the new york state rent regulated multifamily portfolio using originationdate values was percent as of march as compared to percent at december since their origination date property values in this loan segment are down substantially due to unfavorable market conditions in addition to underwriting multifamily loans on the basis of the buildings income and condition we consider the borrowers credit history profitability and building management expertise borrowers are required to present evidence of their ability to repay the loan from the buildings current rent rolls their financial statements and related documents while a percentage of our multifamily loans are tenyear fixed rate credits the vast majority of our multifamily loans feature a term of ten or twelve years with a fixed rate of interest for the first five or seven years of the loan and an alternative rate of interest in years six through ten or eight through twelve the rate charged in the first five or seven years is generally based on intermediateterm interest rates plus a spread during the remaining years the loan resets to an annually adjustable rate that is indexed to cme term sofr or prime plus a spread alternately the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that is tied to the fiveyear fixed advance rate of the fhlbny plus a spread the fixedrate option also requires the payment of one percentage point of the thenoutstanding loan balance in either case the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial fiveor sevenyear term we primarily underwrite our multifamily loans based on the current cash flows produced by the collateral property with a reliance on the income approach to appraising the properties rather than the sales approach we also consider a variety of other factors including the physical condition of the underlying property the net operating income of the mortgaged premises prior to debt service the dscr which is the ratio of the propertys net operating income to its debt service and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value ie the ltv of the property in addition to requiring a minimum dscr of percent on multifamily buildings we obtain a security interest in the personal property located on the premises and an assignment of rents and leases our multifamily loans generally represent no more than percent of the lower of the appraised value or the sales price of the underlying property and typically feature an amortization period of years in addition our multifamily loans may contain an initial interestonly period which typically does not exceed two years however these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis exceptions to these levels are made to borrowers on a case by case basis and approved by the joint authority of credit and lending officers and when necessary the either the management credit committee or the credit committee of the board we continue to monitor our loans held for investment portfolio and the related allowance for credit losses particularly given the economic pressures facing the commercial real estate and multifamily markets although occupancy levels have historically tended to be stable due to below market rents rentregulated loans that are resetting are incurring debt service levels that when combined with inflationary pressure on operating costs and limits on the ability to increase rental rates will approach or exceed some properties net operating income and may require borrower support

properties in the metro new york city area refer to the geographical analysis table included below for additional details approximately billion of the cre portfolio are office properties with an average balance of approximately million and located primarily in the new york metro area occupancy levels for office space have declined substantially over the past three years which has an impact on borrowers net operating income and their ability to cover debt service these unfavorable market conditions also lower the value of underlying collateral and have resulted in higher current ltvs in this loan segment as compared to those at their origination date the terms of more than half of our cre loans primarily feature a fixed rate of interest for the first five years of the loan that is generally based on intermediateterm interest rates plus a spread in addition to customary fixed rate terms we now also offer floating rates advances indexed to cme term sofr these products are generally offered in combination with interest rate cap or swaps that provide borrowers with additional optionality to manage their interest rate risk following the initial fixed rate period the loan resets to an adjustable interest rate that is indexed to cme term sofr or prime plus a spread alternately the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that is tied to the fiveyear fixed advance rate of the fhlbny plus a spread the fixedrate option also requires the payment of an amount equal to one percentage point of the thenoutstanding loan balance in either case the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial five or sevenyear term we originate cre loans in adherence with underwriting standards and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the propertys current income stream and dscr the approval of a loan primarily depends on the borrowers credit history profitability and expertise in property management and generally requires a minimum dscr of percent and a maximum ltv at origination of percent but is tiered to more conservative metrics based upon the inherent risks associated with specific asset types in addition the origination of cre loans typically requires a security interest in the fixtures equipment and other personal property of the borrower andor an assignment of the rents andor leases in addition certain of our cre loans may contain an

total acquisition development and construction loans at march our adc loans represented billion or percent of total loans held for investment reflecting an increase of million compared to december because adc loans are generally considered to have a higher degree of credit risk especially during a downturn in the credit cycle borrowers are required to provide a guarantee of repayment and completion the risk of loss on an adc loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial appraisal of the propertys value upon completion of construction the developers experience the estimated cost of construction including interest and the estimated time to complete andor sell or lease such property when applicable as a condition to closing an adc loan it is our practice to require that properties meet presale or prelease requirements prior to funding ci loans at march ci loans totaled billion or percent of total loans heldforinvestment included in this portfolio is billion in warehouse loans that allow mortgage lenders to fund the closing of residential mortgage loans the nonwarehouse ci loans we produce are primarily made to small and midsize businesses and

guaranteed by the small business administration a broad range of ci loans both collateralized and unsecured are made available to businesses for working capital including inventory and accounts receivable business expansion the purchase of machinery and equipment and other general corporate needs in determining the term and structure of ci loans several factors are considered including the purpose the collateral and the anticipated sources of repayment ci loans are typically secured by business assets and personal guarantees of the borrower and include financial covenants to monitor the borrowers financial stability also included in our ci portfolio is our national warehouse lending platform with relationship managers across the country we offer warehouse lines of credit to other mortgage lenders which allow the lender to fund the closing of residential mortgage loans each extension advance or drawdown on the line is fully collateralized by residential mortgage loans and is paid off when the lender sells the loan to an outside investor or in some instances to the bank underlying mortgage loans are predominantly originated using the agencies underwriting standards the guideline for debt to tangible net worth is to at march we had billion outstanding warehouse loans to other mortgage lenders and have relationships in place to lend up to billi on at our discretion the interest rates on our ci loans can be fixed or floating with floatingrate loans being tied to sofr prime or some other market index plus an applicable spread our floatingrate loans may or may not feature a floor rate of interest the decision to require a floor on ci loans depends on the level of competition we face for such loans from other institutions the direction of market interest rates and the profitability of our relationship with the borrower specialty finance at march specialty finance loans and leases totaled billion or percent of total loans held for investment down million or

march totaled billion down from billion at december we classify loans as held for sale when we originate or purchase loans that we intend to sell we have elected the fair value option for nearly all of this portfolio we estimate the fair value of mortgage loans based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans where available or by discounting estimated cash flows using observable inputs inclusive of interest rates prepayment speeds and loss assumptions for similar collateral credit quality to mitigate the potential for credit losses we underwrite our loans in accordance with credit standards that we consider to be prudent as described more fully in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december the company conducted a thorough review of its largest real estate loans at the end of the first quarter of this review included both internal collateral valuation analysis and obtaining thirdparty estimates of collateral values given the potential reliance on the underlying assets as part of the borrowers ability to repay debt the review also included analysis of the most currently available borrower financial information to evaluate the ability of the underlying collateral to generate sufficient cash flow as the primary source of repayment the company downgraded certain loans in the first quarter of as a result of this review the downgrades were principally related to loans with upcoming maturities or repricing where the estimated property net operating income would not be sufficient to fully cover proforma debt service when applying current market rates and terms and the underlying collateral values are estimated to have declined to at or below the loan carrying amount these downgrades increased loans classified as substandard or worse by billion downgrades to substandard or below reflect the potential a loss may occur if deficiencies in the primary source of repayment for these loans are unable to be corrected refer to note for additional details the procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are generally consistent across all categories with late charges assessed and notices mailed to the borrower at specified dates we attempt to reach the borrower by telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment when contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure or recovery against collateral property we attempt to obtain full payment and will consider a repayment schedule to avoid taking such action delinquencies are addressed by our loan workout unit and every effort is made to collect rather than initiate foreclosure proceedings a loan generally is classified as a nonaccrual loan when it is days or more past due or when it is deemed to be impaired because we no longer expect to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status we cease the accrual of interest owed and previously accrued interest is reversed and charged against interest income at march and december all of our nonperforming loans were nonaccrual loans a loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is current and we have reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible nonperforming loans are reviewed regularly by management and discussed on a monthly basis with the board credit committee and the board of directors of the bank as applicable in accordance with our chargeoff policy collateraldependent nonperforming loans are written down to their current appraised values less certain transaction costs workout specialists from our loan workout unit actively pursue borrowers who are delinquent in repaying their loans in an effort to collect payment in addition outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to institute such action with regard to such borrowers it is our policy to order updated appraisals for all nonperforming loans days or more past due that are collateralized by multifamily buildings cre properties or land if the most recent appraisal on file for the property is more than one year old appraisals are ordered annually until such time as the loan becomes performing and is returned to accrual status it is not our policy to obtain updated appraisals for performing loans however appraisals may be ordered for performing loans when a borrower requests an increase in the loan amount a modification in loan terms or an extension of a maturing loan properties and other assets that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as repossessed assets and are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition less the estimated cost of selling the property subsequent declines in the fair value of the assets are charged to earnings and are included in noninterest expense it is our policy to require an appraisal and an environmental assessment of properties classified as oreo before foreclosure and to reappraise the properties on an asneeded basis and not less than annually until they are sold we dispose of such properties as quickly and prudently as possible given current

which in combination with our modeling suggested credit losses as of march had increased we now expect market interest rates to be higher for a longer period of time which is expected to put additional pressure on the ability for some borrowers whose rates reset to current levels to cover debt service because when combined with inflationary pressure on operating costs and limits on the ability to increase rental rates debt service levels may approach or exceed some properties net operating income which increases the risk of loss we also have continuing pressure in the office portfolio due to remote working and other factors leading to a decline in occupancy levels that reduces operating income and has led to declining property values the allowance for credit losses on

stock at cost and million of fhlbindianapolis stock at cost at december the company had million of fhlbny stock at cost and million of fhlbindianapolis stock at cost the company maintains an investment in fhlb stock partly in conjunction with its membership in the fhlb and partly related to its access to the fhlb funding it utilizes the increase in fhlbny stock was primarily related to increased borrowings in the first quarter of in addition at march and december the company had million of federal reserve bank stock at cost sources of funds on a consolidated basis our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources retail institutional and brokered deposits borrowed funds primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans and cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities deposits our ability to retain and attract deposits depends on numerous factors including customer satisfaction the rates of interest we pay the types of products we offer and the attractiveness of their terms from time to time we have chosen not to compete actively for deposits depending on our access to deposits through acquisitions the availability of lowercost funding sources the impact of competition on pricing and the need to fund our loan demand the majority of our deposits are retail in nature ie they are deposits we have gathered through our branches or through business combinations however we also utilize brokered deposits depending on their availability and pricing relative to other funding sources our uninsured retail deposits declined approximately billion during the three months ended march following the rating agency downgrades of our companys credit ratings in february and march we replaced these deposits with a funding mix that included a higher level of brokered deposits cds and borrowed funds as further described below during the quarter more than private banking teams made up of approximately employees whose responsibilities include the acquisition and retention of customer deposits have left the company the deposits related to those teams and the private bank have remained stable brokered deposits accounted for billion of our deposits at march compared to billion at december brokered money market accounts represented billion of total brokered deposits at march and billion at december brokered interestbearing checking accounts represented billion and billion respectively at march we had billion of brokered cds compared to billion at december the increase in brokered cds was primarily related to funding our core deposit runoff experienced before the march capital infusion our uninsured deposits are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the fdic insurance limit currently these amounts were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting purposes and excludes internal accounts at march our deposit base includes billion of uninsured deposits a net decrease of billion as compared to december primarily due to a decline in uninsured deposits during the first quarter and a shift to insured custodial deposits this represents approximately percent of our total deposits the following table indicates the amount of time deposits by account that are in excess of the fdic insurance limit currently by time remaining until maturity in millions march december portion of us time deposits in excess of insurance limit time deposits otherwise uninsured with a maturity of months or less over months through months over months through months over months total time deposits otherwise uninsured borrowed funds the majority of our borrowed funds consist of wholesale borrowings including fhlb advances the bank term funding program of the frb of new york repurchase agreements and to a lesser extent junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes at march total borrowed funds increased billion to billion compared to the balance at december primarily driven by the decline in deposits and actions to proactively manage our liquidity needs wholesale borrowings wholesale borrowings at march were billion compared to billion at december fhlb advances accounted for billion and billion at march and december respectively secured by eligible collateral in the form of loans and securities under blanket collateral agreements with the fhlb at march and december billion and billion of our wholesale borrowings had callable features respectively additionally billion was drawn on the bank term funding program secured by eligible securities the increase in fhlb advances at march compared to december was driven by actions taken in the first quarter to proactively manage our liquidity needs repurchase agreements outstanding at march were billion and we did not have any of these agreements outstanding at december these agreements primarily use gse obligations as collateral and were entered into with either the fhlb or specific brokerage firms see note borrowed funds in item financial statements and supplementary data for a further discussion of our wholesale borrowings our junior subordinated debentures and subordinated debt liquidity contractual obligations and offbalance sheet commitments and capital position liquidity we manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations and to protect against temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand we monitor our liquidity daily and in times of stress throughout the day our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents which totaled billion and billion at march and december respectively the billion increase in cash and cash equivalents was driven by actions to proactively manage our liquidity needs additional liquidity stems from deposits and from our use of wholesale funding sources including wholesale borrowings and brokered deposits in addition we have access to the banks approved lines of credit with various counterparties including the fhlb the availability of these wholesale funding sources is generally based on the amount of mortgage loan collateral available under a blanket lien we have pledged to the respective institutions and to a lesser extent the amount of available securities that may be pledged to collateralize our borrowings at march our available borrowing capacity with the fhlb was billion furthermore the bank has agreements with the frb that enable it to access the discount window as a further means of enhancing our liquidity in connecti on with these agreements the bank has pledged certain loans and securities to collateralize any funds we may borrow the maximum amount the bank could borrow from the frb was billion there were no borrowings against these lines of credit at march in april of we drew billion on this line to increase on balance sheet liquidity by increasing cash at march our total liquidity cash and cash equivalents highquality liquid assets and borrowing capacity was billion total liquidity was billion greater than our net uninsured deposits of billion the parent company is a separate legal entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity at march the parent company held cash and cash equivalents of million in addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases the parent company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to our common and preferred stockholders as a delaware corporation the parent company is able to pay dividends either from surplus or in case there is no surplus from net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year various legal restrictions limit the extent to which the companys subsidiary bank can supply funds to the parent company and its nonbank subsidiaries the bank would require the approval of the occ if the dividends it declares in any calendar year were to exceed the total of its respective net profits for that year combined with its respective retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years less any required transfer to paidin capital the term net profits is defined as net income for a given period less any dividends paid during that period as a result of our acquisition of flagstar we are also required to seek regulatory approval from the occ for the payment of any dividend to the parent company through at least the period ending november in connection with receiving regulatory approval from the occ for the signature transaction the bank has committed that i for a period of two years from the date of the signature transaction it will not declare or pay any dividend without receiving a prior written determination of no supervisory objection from the occ and ii it will not declare or pay dividends on the amount of retained earnings that represents any net bargain purchase gain that is subject to a conditional period that may be imposed by the occ in the three months ended march dividends of million were paid by the bank to the parent company we have reduced our dividends to common stockholders to per common share and we do not anticipate a material amount of dividends from the bank to the parent company in the near future until the company is able to achieve a return to repeatable operating income at march we believe the company has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations over the next months contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business we enter into a variety of contractual obligations in order to manage our assets and liabilities fund loan growth operate our branch network and address our capital needs for example we offer cds with contractual terms to our customers and borrow funds under contract from the fhlb these contractual obligations are reflected in the consolidated statements of condition under deposits and borrowed funds respectively at march we had cds of billion and longterm debt defined as borrowed funds with an original maturity one year or more of billion we also are obligated under certain noncancelable operating leases on the buildings and land we use in operating our branch network and in performing our backoffice responsibilities these obligations are included in the consolidated statements of condition in other liabilities and totaled million at march a decrease of million compared to million at december at march we also had commitments to extend credit in the form of mortgage and other loan originations as well as commercial performance standby and financial standby letters of credit these commitments consist of agreements to extend credit as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract under which the loan is made commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee the following table summarizes the companys commitments to originate loans and letters of credit in millions march december multifamily and commercial real estate onetofour family including interest rate locks acquisition development and construction warehouse loan commitments other loan commitments total loan commitments commercial performance standby and financial standby letters of credit total commitments the letters of credit we issue consist of performance standby financial standby and commercial letters of credit financial standby letters of credit primarily are issued for the benefit of other financial institutions municipalities or landlords on behalf of certain of our current borrowers and obligate us to guarantee payment of a specified financial obligation performance standby letters of credit are primarily issued for the benefit of local municipalities on behalf of certain of our borrowers performance letters of credit obligate us to make payments in the event that a specified third party fails to perform under nonfinancial contractual obligations commercial letters of credit act as a means of ensuring payment to a seller upon shipment of goods to a buyer although commercial letters of credit are used to effect payment for domestic transactions the majority are used to settle payments in international trade typically such letters of credit require the presentation of documents that describe the commercial transaction and provide evidence of shipment and the transfer of title the fees we collect in connection with the issuance of letters of credit are included in fee income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income based upon our current cash and cash equivalent balance of billion and our total liquidity position of billion we expect that our funding will be sufficient to fulfill these cash obligations and commitments when they are due both in the short term and long term for the three months ended march we did not engage in any offbalance sheet transactions that we expect to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows at march we had no commitments to purchase securities regulatory capital the company is a bank holding company subject to regulation examination and supervision by the federal reserve the bank is national bank subject to regulation examination and supervision by the occ the company and the bank are each subject to the prompt corrective action regulatory capital framework that establishes five categories of capital adequacy ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized an institutions capital category affects various matters including legal requirements for regulators to take prompt corrective action and the level of a banks fdic deposit insurance premium assessments capital amounts and classifications are also subject to the regulators qualitative judgments about the components of capital and risk weighting assets among other factors and the regulators have discretion to require that institutions maintain capital in excess of minimum levels the quantitative measures established to ensure capital adequacy require that banks and bank holding companies maintain minimum amounts and ratios of leverage capital to average assets and of common equity tier capital tier capital and total capital to riskweighted assets as such measures are defined in the regulations at march our capital measures continued to exceed the minimum federal requirements for a bank holding company and for a bank the following tables set forth the common equity tier tier riskbased total riskbased and leverage capital amounts and ratios for the company on a consolidated basis and for the bank on a standalone basis as well as the respective minimum regulatory capital requirements as of the dates shown the following tables present the actual capital amounts and ratios for the company riskbased capital march common equity tier tier total leverage capital dollars in millions amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio total capital minimum for capital adequacy purposes excess december total capital minimum for capital adequacy purposes excess at march our total riskbased capital ratio exceeded the minimum requirement for capital adequacy purposes by basis points after considering the capital conservation buffer that represents an additional percent of risk weighted assets our total riskbased capital ratio exceed this limit by basis points the increase from december was primarily driven by a billion capital investment in the first quarter which resulted in a net million increase to common equity tier capital through the issuance of common stock and warrants and a net million increase to tier capital from the issuance of convertible noncumulative perpetual preferred stock the net million in tier capital will convert to common equity subsequent to an increase in registered common shares subject to shareholder approval as converted our common equity tier ratio would have been percent refer to note for additional details the following tables present the actual capital amounts and ratios for the bank riskbased capital march common equity tier tier total leverage capital dollars in millions amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio total capital minimum for capital adequacy purposes excess december total capital minimum for capital adequacy purposes excess the bank also exceeded the minimum capital requirements to be categorized as well capitalized to be categorized as well capitalized a bank must maintain a minimum common equity tier ratio of percent a minimum tier riskbased capital ratio of percent a minimum total riskbased capital ratio of percent and a minimum leverage capital ratio of percent other recent developments on november the fdic published in the federal register its final rule that imposes special assessments to recover the loss to the deposit insurance fund the final rule calls for the fdic to collect special assessments at an annual rate of approximately basis points over eight quarterly assessment periods beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of ie january through march with an invoice payment date of june included in total operating expenses for the three months ended december is a million expense for the fdic special assessment that includes the assessment issued by the fdic in february the fdic continues to provide an updated estimate of each institutions quarterly and total special assessment expense and while we expect this may result in an increase we do not expect the increase to be material on july the federal banking agencies the fdic the federal reserve and the occ released a notice of proposed rulemaking that would make significant amendments to the basel iii capital rules applicable to both the company and the bank in general the proposed rule would align the regulatory capital calculation methodology for category iii and iv banking organizations with the methodology applicable to category i and ii banking organizations in addition to calculating riskweighted assets under the current us standardized approach the proposal introduces a new expanded riskbased approach including standardized approaches for credit risk operational risk and credit valuation adjustment risk as well as a new approach for market risk that would be based upon internal models and standardized supervisory models if adopted as proposed the company would be required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the current us standardized approach and the expanded riskbased approach and would be subject to the lower of the two resulting ratios for each riskbased capital ratio in addition the proposal would require banking organizations to recognize most elements of aoci in regulatory capital including unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale securities and lower thresholds for deductions from cet1 capital for mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets among other things the proposal if enacted would have an effective date of july with certain elements such as the recognition of aoci in regulatory capital and changes in riskweighted assets calculated under the expanded riskbased approach having a threeyear phasein period we are in the process of evaluating this proposed rulemaking and assessing its potential impact on the company and the bank if adopted as proposed market risk as a financial institution we are focused on reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility which represents our primary market risk changes in market interest rates represent the greatest challenge to our financial performance as such changes can have a significant impact on the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and on the market value of all interestearning assets other than those possessing a short term to maturity to reduce our exposure to changing rates the board of directors and management monitor interest rate sensitivity on a regular or as needed basis so that adjustments to the asset and liability mix can be made when deemed appropriate the actual duration of heldforinvestment mortgage loans and mortgagerelated securities can be significantly impacted by changes in prepayment levels and market interest rates the level of prepayments may in turn be impacted by a variety of factors including the economy in the region where the underlying mortgages were originated seasonal factors demographic variables and the assumability of the underlying mortgages however the factors with the most significant impact on prepayments are market interest rates and the availability of refinancing opportunities we managed our interest rate risk by taking the following actions continue to increase the investments portfolio with an overall shorter duration profile the use of derivatives to manage our interest rate position increased the focus on retaining and increasing our branch deposits base uninsured deposits we manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand as a result we have total liquidity of billion which exceeds the balance of our uninsured deposits by billion our uninsured deposits are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the fdic insurance limit currently these amounts were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting purposes and excludes internal accounts at march our deposit base includes billion of uninsured deposits reflecting a net decrease of billion as compared to december due to decreases in uninsured deposits and a shift to insured custodial deposits uninsured deposits which represents approximately percent of our total deposits at march decreased following our earnings announcement and subsequent rating agency downgrades of our companys credit ratings in february and march our deposits have remained stable since the announcement of the billion capital raise interest rate sensitivity analysis interest rate sensitivity is monitored through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in our economic value of equity eve over a range of interest rate scenarios eve is defined as the net present value of expected cash flows from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet contracts the eve ratio under any interest rate scenario is defined as the eve in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario the model assumes estimated loan and mbs prepayment rates current market value spreads and deposit decay rates and betas based on the information and assumptions in effect at march the following table sets forth our eve assuming the changes in interest rates noted change in interest rates in basis points estimated percentage change in economic value of equity shock shock shock shock the net changes in eve presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the boards of directors of the company and the bank subsequent to march we terminated all of our derivatives that were designated in a cash flow or fair value hedge relationship this action reduced our asset sensitivity resulting in a relatively neutral position accordingly while the eve analysis provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and may very well differ from actual results interest rate risk is also monitored through the use of a model that generates net interest income nii simulations over a range of interest rate scenarios modeling changes in nii requires that certain assumptions be made which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates in this regard the nii analysis presented below assumes that the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities furthermore the model does not take into account the benefit of any strategic actions we may take to further reduce our exposure to interest rate risk the assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the following table due to the frequency timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories and prepayments among other factors coupled with any actions taken to counter the effects of any such changes based on the information and assumptions in effect at march the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in future net interest income for the next twelve months assuming the changes in interest rates noted change in interest rates in basis points estimated percentage change in future net interest income shock shock shock shock in general short and longterm rates are assumed to increase in parallel instantaneously and then remain unchanged the net changes in nii presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the boards of directors of the company and the bank future changes in our mix of assets and liabilities may result in greater changes to our eve andor nii simulations subsequent to march we terminated all of our derivatives that were designated in a cash flow or fair value hedge relationship this action reduced our asset sensitivity resulting in a relatively neutral position in the event that our eve and net interest income sensitivities were to breach our internal policy limits we would plan to undertake the following actions in formulating appropriate strategies the alco committee would ascertain the primary causes of the variance from policy tolerances the expected term of such conditions and the projected effect on capital and earnings our alco committee would inform the board of directors of the variance and present recommendations to the board regarding proposed courses of action to restore conditions to withinpolicy tolerances where temporary changes in market conditions or volume levels result in significant increases in risk strategies may involve reducing open positions or employing other balance sheet management activities including the potential use of derivatives to reduce the risk exposure where variance from policy tolerances is triggered by more fundamental imbalances in the risk profiles of core loan and deposit products a remedial strategy may involve restoring balance through natural hedges to the extent possible before employing synthetic hedging techniques other strategies might include asset restructuring involving sales of assets having higher risk profiles or a gradual restructuring of the asset mix over time to affect the maturity or repricing schedule of assets liability restructuring whereby product offerings and pricing are altered or wholesale borrowings are employed to affect the maturity structure or repricing of liabilities expansion or shrinkage of the balance sheet to correct imbalances in the repricing or maturity periods between assets and liabilities andor use or alteration of offbalance sheet positions including interest rate swaps caps floors options and forward purchase or sales commitments in connection with our net interest income simulation modeling we also evaluate the impact of changes in the slope of the yield curve at march our analysis indicated that a further inversion of the yield curve would be expected to result in a percent increase in net interest income conversely an immediate steepening of the yield curve would be expected to result in a percent decrease in net interest income critical accounting estimates various elements of our accounting policies by their nature are subject to estimation techniques valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments certain accounting policies that due to the judgment estimates and assumptions are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements and the notes are described in item these policies relate to a the determination of our acl b valuation of mortgage servicing rights and c the acquisition method of accounting we believe the judgment estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the notes are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time however given the sensitivity of our consolidated financial statements and the notes to these critical accounting policies the use of other judgments estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in our results of operations andor financial condition for further
