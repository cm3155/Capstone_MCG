fullyear and a return on average common stockholders equity of versus the key trends during were strong yearoveryear growth in our loan portfolio at december total loans and leases held for investment were billion up billion or compared to december the majority of this growth took place during the fourth quarter of the year as total loans and leases held for investment increased billion compared to september both the yearoveryear and linkedquarter increase were driven by our multifamily and specialty finance portfolios offset by modest declines in the cre portfolio at yearend multifamily loans increased billion or compared to yearend with most of this growth occurring in the fourth quarter multifamily loans grew billion during the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of the growth in the multifamily portfolio was driven by increased activity on the part of both existing and new borrowers prompted by the expectation of higher interest rates in a strong rebound in property transactions and the companys ability to service and meet our borrowers needs the specialty finance portfolio totaled billion at december up million or compared to december and up million compared to september the increase in specialty finance loans was the result of increased borrowers demand due to improved economic activity our deposit base continued to show solid growth total deposits at december were billion up billion or compared to december and increased million compared to september core deposits total deposits excluding cds increased to billion at yearend up billion or compared to yearend and million compared to the third quarter of the yearoveryear growth was driven by higher levels of noninterest bearing accounts and savings accounts noninterest bearing accounts at december totaled billion up billion or compared to december savings accounts totaled billion at december increasing billion or compared to the balance at december this was offset by a billion or decrease in cds which totaled billion at december cds at yearend represented of total deposits compared to at yearend total deposits at yearend also reflect the impact of various initiatives we undertook during the year the launch of our banking as a service business and an increase in loanrelated deposits loanrelated deposits increased million or to billion at yearend compared to yearend

in continued growth in our net interest income and nim expansion during the twelve months ended december both our net interest income and the nim continued to improve net interest income for fullyear increased million or to billion compared to fullyear the yearoveryear increase was primarily due to lower interest expense interest expense fell million or to million for the twelve months ended december included in net interest income for the twelve months ended december was million of prepayment income up million or compared to the twelve months ended december our nim also improved during fullyear for the twelve months ended december the nim expanded bp to compared to the twelve months ended december the improvement was driven by a decline in our cost of funding which declined bps to

cares actrelated deferrals also improved at december deferred loans paying interestonly and escrow totaled million down billion or compared to yearend as of yearend the company had zero fullpayment deferrals critical accounting policies the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods actual results may differ from these estimates under varying conditions on a quarterly basis management evaluates its estimates particularly those that involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments and are often about matters that are inherently uncertain the most significant judgments and estimates relate to the accounting policy for the allowance for credit losses that is discussed in more detail below the judgments used by management in applying these critical accounting policies may be influenced by adverse changes in the economic environment which may result in changes to future financial results allowance for credit losses the companys january adoption of asu no measurement of credit losses on financial instruments resulted in a significant change to our methodology for estimating the allowance since december asu no replaced the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the cecl methodology the measurement of expected credit losses under cecl is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost including loan receivables it also applies to offbalance sheet exposures not accounted for as insurance and net investments in leases accounted for under asc topic at december the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases totaled million on january the company adopted the cecl methodology under asu topic and recognized an increase in the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases of million as a day transition adjustment from changes in methodology with a corresponding decrease in retained earnings separately at december the company had an allowance for unfunded commitments of million upon adoption the company recognized an increase in the allowance for unfunded commitments of million as a day transition adjustment with a corresponding decrease in retained earnings the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases is deducted from the amortized cost basis of a financial asset or a group of financial assets so that the balance sheet reflects the net amount the company expects to collect amortized cost is the unpaid loan balance net of deferred fees and expenses and includes negative escrow subsequent changes favorable and unfavorable in expected credit losses are recognized immediately in net income as a credit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense management estimates the allowance by projecting and multiplying together the probabilityofdefault lossgivendefault and exposureatdefault depending on economic parameters for each month of the remaining contractual term economic parameters are developed using available information relating to past events current conditions and economic forecasts the companys economic forecast period is months and afterwards reverts to a historical average loss rate on a straight line basis over a month period historical credit experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses with qualitative adjustments made for differences in current loanspecific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards portfolio mix delinquency levels and terms as well as for changes in environmental conditions such as changes in legislation regulation policies administrative practices or other relevant factors expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans adjusted for forecasted prepayments when appropriate the contractual term excludes potential extensions or renewals the methodology used in the estimation of the allowance for loan and lease losses which is performed at least quarterly is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and forecasted economic conditions each quarter the company reassesses the appropriateness of the economic forecasting period the reversion period and historical mean at the portfolio segment level considering any required adjustments for differences in underwriting standards portfolio mix and other relevant data shifts over time the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist the portfolio segment represents the level at which a systematic methodology is applied to estimate credit losses management believes the products within each of the entitys portfolio segments exhibit similar risk characteristics smaller pools of homogenous financing receivables with homogeneous risk characteristics were modeled using the methodology selected for the portfolio segment the macroeconomic data used in the quantitative models are based on a reasonable and supportable forecast period of months the company leverages economic projections including property market and prepayment forecasts from established independent third parties to inform its loss drivers in the forecast beyond this forecast period the company reverts to a historical average loss rate this reversion to the historical average loss rate is performed on a straightline basis over months loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis these include loans that are in nonaccrual status with balances above management determined materiality thresholds depending on loan class and also loans that are designated as tdr or reasonably expected tdr criticized classified or maturing loans that will have a modification processed within the next three months in addition all taxi medallion loans are individually evaluated if a loan is determined to be collateral dependent or meets the criteria to apply the collateral dependent practical expedient expected credit losses are determined based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date less costs to sell as appropriate the company maintains an allowance for credit losses on offbalance sheet credit exposures the company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the company the allowance for credit losses on offbalance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit losses expense the estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over their estimated life the company examined historical credit conversion factor ccf trends to estimate utilization rates and chose an appropriate mean ccf based on both management judgment and quantitative analysis quantitative analysis involved examination of ccfs over a range of fundup windows between and months and comparison of the mean ccf for each fundup window with management judgment determining whether the highest mean ccf across fundup windows made business sense the company applies the same standards and estimated loss rates to the credit exposures as to the related class of loans when applying this critical accounting policy we incorporate several inputs and judgments that may be influenced by changes period to period these include but are not limited to changes in the economic environment and forecasts changes in the credit profile and characteristics of the loan portfolio and changes in prepayment assumptions which will result in provisions to or recoveries from the balance of the allowance for credit losses while changes to the economic environment forecasts and portfolio characteristics will change from period to period portfolio prepayments are an integral assumption in estimating the allowance for credit losses on our mortgage loan portfolio are subject to estimation uncertainty and changes in this assumption could have a material impact to our estimation process prepayment assumptions are sensitive to interest rates and existing loan terms and determine the weighted average life of the mortgage loan portfolio excluding other factors as the weighted average life of the portfolio increases or decreases so will the required amount of the allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans a decrease in prepayment assumptions would lead to an increase in the required allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans of approximately financial condition balance sheet summary at december total assets were billion up billion or compared to december and up billion compared to the third quarter of the growth compared to both periods was driven by highsingle digit loan growth funded primarily through deposits and a fourthquarter increase in the level of whole sale borrowings total loans and leases held for investment of billion increased billion or compared to december and rose billion compared to september both the yearoveryear and linkedquarter was due to growth in both the multifamily and specialty finance portfolios offset by modest declines in the cre portfolio total deposits for the full year were billion up billion or compared to last year and increased million compared to the previous quarter core deposits total deposits excluding cds increased to billion of yearend up billion or compared to yearend and million compared to the third quarter of borrowed funds totaled billion of yearend up million or compared to yearend given the strong loan growth during the fourth quarter of the company utilized borrowings of all which were fhlbny advances to fund some of this growth accordingly borrowed funds during the fourth quarter increased billion compared to the third quarter of loans held for investment the majority of the loans we produce are multifamily loans our production of multifamily loans began several decades ago in the five boroughs of new york city where the majority of the rental units currently consist of rentregulated apartments featuring belowmarket rents in addition to multifamily loans our loan portfolio contains a large number of cre credits most of which are secured by incomeproducing properties located in new york city and on long island in addition to multifamily loans and cre loans our specialty finance loans and leases have become an increasingly larger portion of our overall loan portfolio the remainder of our portfolio includes smaller balances of ci loan onetofour family loans adc loans and other loans held for investment the majority of our ci loans consist of loans to small and midsize businesses in we originated billion of loans a million or a increase from the prior year the higher level of originations was largely driven by a increase in specialty finance originations multifamily loans multifamily loans are our principal asset the loans we produce are primarily secured by nonluxury residential apartment buildings in new york city that feature rentregulated units and belowmarket rentsa market we refer to as our primary lending niche consistent with our emphasis on multifamily lending multifamily loan originations represented billion or of the loans we produced for investment in at december multifamily loans represented billion or of total loans held for investment reflecting a yearoveryear increase of billion or the majority of our multifamily loans were secured by rental apartment buildings at december billion or of the companys total multifamily loan portfolio is secured by properties in new york state and therefore are subject to the new rent regulation laws the weighted average ltv of the nys rent regulated multifamily portfolio was as of december compared to a weighted average ltv of for the entire multifamily loan portfolio at that date in addition to underwriting multifamily loans on the basis of the buildings income and condition we consider the borrowers credit history profitability and building management expertise borrowers are required to present evidence of their ability to repay the loan from the buildings current rent rolls their financial statements and related documents while a percentage of our multifamily loans are tenyear fixed rate credits the vast majority of our multifamily loans feature a term of ten or twelve years with a fixed rate of interest for the first five or seven years of the loan and an alternative rate of interest in years six through ten or eight through twelve the rate charged in the first five or seven years is generally based on intermediateterm interest rates plus a spread during the remaining years the loan resets to an annually adjustable rate that is tied to the prime rate of interest plus a spread alternately the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that is tied to the fiveyear fixed advance rate of the fhlbny plus a spread the fixedrate option also requires the payment of one percentage point of the thenoutstanding loan balance in either case the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial fiveor sevenyear term as the rent roll increases the typical property owner seeks to refinance the mortgage and generally does so before the loan reprices in year six or eight multifamily loans that refinance within the first five or seven years are typically subject to an established prepayment penalty schedule depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the thencurrent loan balance if a loan extends past the fifth or seventh year and the borrower selects the fixedrate option the prepayment penalties typically reset to a range of five points to one point over years six through ten or eight through twelve for example a tenyear multifamily loan that prepays in year three would generally be expected to pay a prepayment penalty equal to three percentage points of the remaining principal balance a twelveyear multifamily loan that prepays in year one or two would generally be expected to pay a penalty equal to five percentage points because prepayment penalties are recorded as interest income they are reflected in the average yields on our loans and interestearning assets our net interest rate spread and net interest margin and the level of net interest income we record no assumptions are involved in the recognition of prepayment income as such income is only recorded when cash is received our success as a multifamily lender partly reflects the solid relationships we have developed with the markets leading mortgage brokers who are familiar with our lending practices our underwriting standards and our longstanding practice of basing our loans on the cash flows produced by the properties the process of producing such loans is generally four to six weeks in duration and because the multifamily market is largely brokerdriven the expense incurred in sourcing such loans is substantially reduced our emphasis on multifamily loans is driven by several factors including their structure which reduces our exposure to interest rate volatility to some degree another factor driving our focus on multifamily lending has been the comparative quality of the loans we produce reflecting the nature of the buildings securing our loans our underwriting standards and the generally conservative ltv ratios our multifamily loans feature at origination a relatively small percentage of the multifamily loans that have transitioned to nonperforming status have actually resulted in losses even when the credit cycle has taken a downward turn we primarily underwrite our multifamily loans based on the current cash flows produced by the collateral property with a reliance on the income approach to appraising the properties rather than the sales approach the sales approach is subject to fluctuations in the real estate market as well as general economic conditions and is therefore likely to be more risky in the event of a downward credit cycle turn we also consider a variety of other factors including the physical condition of the underlying property the net operating income of the mortgaged premises prior to debt service the dscr which is the ratio of the propertys net operating income to its debt service and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value ie the ltv of the property in addition to requiring a minimum dscr of on multifamily buildings we obtain a security interest in the personal property located on the premises and an assignment of rents and leases our multifamily loans generally represent no more than of the lower of the appraised value or the sales price of the underlying property and typically feature an amortization period of years in addition our multifamily loans may contain an initial interestonly period which typically does not exceed two years however these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis accordingly while our multifamily lending niche has not been immune to downturns in the credit cycle the limited number of losses we have recorded even in adverse credit cycles suggests that the multifamily loans we produce involve less credit risk than certain other types of loans in general buildings that are subject to rent regulation have tended to be stable with occupancy levels remaining more or less constant over time because the rents are typically below market and the buildings securing our loans are generally maintained in good condition they have been more likely to retain their tenants in adverse economic times in addition we exclude any shortterm property tax exemptions and abatement benefits the property owners receive when we underwrite our multifamily loans commercial real estate loans at december cre loans represented billion or of total loans held for investment reflecting a yearoveryear decrease of million or compared to december cre loans represented million or of the loans we originated in as compared to million or in the prior year the cre loans we produce are secured by incomeproducing properties such as office buildings retail centers mixeduse buildings and multitenanted light industrial properties at december of our cre loans were secured by properties in the metro new york city area while properties in other parts of new york state accounted for of the properties securing our cre credits while all other states accounted for combined the terms of our cre loans are similar to the terms of our multifamily credits while a small percentage of our cre loans feature tenyear fixedrate terms they primarily feature a fixed rate of interest for the first five or seven years of the loan that is generally based on intermediateterm interest rates plus a spread during years six through ten or eight through twelve the loan resets to an annually adjustable rate that is tied to the prime rate of interest plus a spread alternately the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that is tied to the fiveyear fixed advance rate of the fhlbny plus a spread the fixedrate option also requires the payment of an amount equal to one percentage point of the thenoutstanding loan balance in either case the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial five or sevenyear term prepayment penalties apply to our cre loans as they do our multifamily credits depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the thencurrent loan balance if a loan extends past the fifth or seventh year and the borrower selects the fixed rate option the prepayment penalties typically reset to a range of five points to one point over years six through ten or eight through twelve our cre loans tend to refinance within two to three years of origination as reflected in the expected weighted average life of the cre portfolio noted above the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties to minimize our credit risk we originate cre loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the propertys current income stream and dscr the approval of a loan also depends on the borrowers credit history profitability and expertise in property management and generally requires a minimum dscr of and a maximum ltv of in addition the origination of cre loans typically requires a security interest in the fixtures equipment and other personal property of the borrower andor an assignment of the rents andor leases in addition our cre loans may contain an interestonly period which typically does not exceed three years however these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis specialty finance loans and leases at december specialty finance loans and leases totaled billion or of total loans held for investment up million or compared to december we produce our specialty finance loans and leases through a subsidiary that is staffed by a group of industry veterans with expertise in originating and underwriting senior securitized debt and equipment loans and leases the subsidiary participates in syndicated loans that are brought to them and equipment loans and leases that are assigned to them by a select group of nationally recognized sources and are generally made to large corporate obligors many of which are publicly traded carry investment grade or nearinvestment grade ratings and participate in stable industries nationwide the specialty finance loans and leases we fund fall into three categories assetbased lending dealer floorplan lending and equipment loan and lease financing each of these credits is secured with a perfected first security interest in or outright ownership of the underlying collateral and structured as senior debt or as a noncancelable lease as of december nycb specialty finance has billion of loans outstanding versus billion in loan commitments of the billion in nycb specialty finance commitments or billion are structured as floating rate obligations which will benefit in a rising rate environment all floating rate obligations are being transitioned from libor to an appropriate libor replacement index in accordance with the regulatory guidance provided around libor cessation during the company originated billion of specialty finance loans and leases representing of total originations compared to billion during representing of total originations since launching our specialty finance business in the third quarter of no losses have been recorded on any of the loans or leases in this portfolio ci loans in the twelve months ended december ci loans increased million or to million or of total loans and represented million or of the held for investment loans we originated in contrast to the loans produced by our specialty finance subsidiary the ci loans we produce are primarily made to small and midsize businesses in the five boroughs of new york city and on long island such loans are tailored to meet the specific needs of our borrowers and include term loans demand loans revolving lines of credit and to a much lesser extent loans that are partly guaranteed by the small business administration a broad range of ci loans both collateralized and unsecured are made available to businesses for working capital including inventory and accounts receivable business expansion the purchase of machinery and equipment and other general corporate needs in determining the term and structure of ci loans several factors are considered including the purpose the collateral and the anticipated sources of repayment ci loans are typically secured by business assets and personal guarantees of the borrower and include financial covenants to monitor the borrowers financial stability the interest rates on our ci loans can be fixed or floating with floatingrate loans being tied to prime or some other market index plus an applicable spread our floatingrate loans may or may not feature a floor rate of interest the decision to require a floor on ci loans depends on the level of competition we face for such loans from other institutions the direction of market interest rates and the profitability of our relationship with the borrower acquisition development and construction loans at december adc loans represented million or of total loans held for investment as compared to million or at the prior yearend originations of adc loans totaled million in up from million at december because adc loans are generally considered to have a higher degree of credit risk especially during a downturn in the credit cycle borrowers are required to provide a guarantee of repayment and completion in the twelve months ended december and we did not recover any losses against guarantees the risk of loss on an adc loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial appraisal of the propertys value upon completion of construction the developers experience the estimated cost of construction including interest and the estimated time to complete andor sell or lease such property when applicable as a condition to closing an adc loan it is our practice to require that properties meet presale or prelease requirements prior to funding onetofour family loans at december onetofour family loans represented million or of total loans held for investment as compared to million or at the prior yearend these loan balances include certain mixeduse cre loans with less than five residential units classified as onetofour family loans other than these types of loans we do not currently originate traditional onetofour family loans other loans at december other loans totaled

less than or equal to million and ci loans less than or equal to million are approved by the joint authority of lending officers ci loans in excess of million and all multifamily cre adc and specialty finance loans in excess of million are required to be presented to the management credit committee for approval multifamily cre adc and specialty finance loans in excess of million and ci loans in excess of million are also required to be presented to the board credit committee of the board so that the committee can review the loans associated risks and approve the credit the board credit committee has authority to direct changes in lending practices as they deem necessary or appropriate in order to address individual or aggregate risks and credit exposures in accordance with the banks strategic objectives and risk appetites in addition all loans of million or more originated by the bank continue to be reported to the board of directors in loans greater than million were originated by the bank with an aggregate loan balance of billion at origination in by comparison loans greater than million were originated with an aggregate loan balance at origination of billion at december and the largest mortgage loan in our portfolio was a million multifamily loan which is collateralized by six properties located in brooklyn new york as of the date of this report the loan has been

restored to performing status balance at december table end a loan generally is classified as a nonaccrual loan when it is days or more past due or when it is deemed to be impaired because we no longer expect to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status we cease the accrual of interest owed and previously accrued interest is reversed and charged against interest income at december and all of our nonperforming loans were nonaccrual loans a loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is current and we have reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible we monitor nonaccrual loans both within and beyond our primary lending area in the same manner monitoring loans generally involves inspecting and reappraising the collateral properties holding discussions with the principals and managing agents of the borrowing entities andor retained legal counsel as applicable requesting financial operating and rent roll information confirming that hazard insurance is in place or forceplacing such insurance monitoring tax payment status and advancing funds as needed and appointing a receiver whenever possible to collect rents manage the operations provide information and maintain the collateral properties it is our policy to order updated appraisals for all nonperforming loans irrespective of loan type that are collateralized by multifamily buildings cre properties or land in the event that such a loan is days or more past due and if the most recent appraisal on file for the property is more than one year old appraisals are ordered annually until such time as the loan becomes performing and is returned to accrual status it is not our policy to obtain updated appraisals for performing loans however appraisals may be ordered for performing loans when a borrower requests an increase in the loan amount a modification in loan terms or an extension of a maturing loan we do not analyze current ltvs on a portfoliowide basis nonperforming loans are reviewed regularly by management and discussed on a monthly basis with the mortgage committee the credit committee and the board of directors of the bank as applicable in accordance with our chargeoff policy collateraldependent nonperforming loans are written down to their current appraised values less certain transaction costs workout specialists from our loan workout unit actively pursue borrowers who are delinquent in repaying their loans in an effort to collect payment in addition outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to institute such action with regard to such borrowers properties and other assets that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as repossessed assets and are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition less the estimated cost of selling the property subsequent declines in the fair value of the assets are charged to earnings and are included in noninterest expense it is our policy to require an appraisal and an environmental assessment of properties classified as oreo before foreclosure and to reappraise the properties on an asneeded basis and not less than annually until they are sold we dispose of such properties as quickly and prudently as possible given current market conditions and the propertys condition to mitigate the potential for credit losses we underwrite our loans in accordance with credit standards that we consider to be prudent in the case of multifamily and cre loans we look first at the consistency of the cash flows being generated by the property to determine its economic value using the income approach and then at the market value of the property that collateralizes the loan the amount of the loan is then based on the lower of the two values with the economic value more typically used the condition of the collateral property is another critical factor multifamily buildings and cre properties are inspected from rooftop to basement as a prerequisite to approval with a member of the mortgage or credit committee participating in inspections on multifamily loans to be originated in excess of million and a member of the mortgage or credit committee participating in inspections on cre loans to be originated in excess of million furthermore independent appraisers whose appraisals are carefully reviewed by our experienced inhouse appraisal officers and staff perform appraisals on collateral properties in many cases a second independent appraisal review is performed in addition we work with a select group of mortgage brokers who are familiar with our credit standards and whose track record with our lending officers is typically greater than ten years furthermore in new york city where the majority of the buildings securing our multifamily loans are located the rents that tenants may be charged on certain apartments are typically restricted under certain rentcontrol or rentstabilization laws as a result the rents that tenants pay for such apartments are generally lower than current market rents buildings with a preponderance of such rentregulated apartments are less likely to experience vacancies in times of economic adversity reflecting the strength of the underlying collateral for these loans and the collateral structure a relatively small percentage of our nonperforming multifamily loans have resulted in losses over time to further manage our credit risk our lending policies limit the amount of credit granted to any one borrower and typically require minimum dscrs of for multifamily loans and for cre loans although we typically lend up to of the appraised value on multifamily buildings and up to on commercial properties the average ltvs of such credits at origination were below those amounts at december exceptions to these ltv limitations are minimal and are reviewed on a casebycase basis the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties to minimize our credit risk we originate cre loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the propertys current income stream and dscr the approval of a cre loan also depends on the borrowers credit history profitability and expertise in property management given that our cre loans are underwritten in accordance with underwriting standards that are similar to those applicable to our multifamily credits the percentage of our nonperforming cre loans that have resulted in losses has been comparatively small over time multifamily and cre loans are generally originated at conservative ltvs and dscrs as previously stated low ltvs provide a greater likelihood of full recovery and reduce the possibility of incurring a severe loss on a credit in many cases they reduce the likelihood of the borrower walking away from the property although borrowers may default on loan payments they have a greater incentive to protect their equity in the collateral property and to return their loans to performing status furthermore in the case of multifamily loans the cash flows generated by the properties are generally belowmarket and have significant value with regard to adc loans we typically lend up to of the estimated ascompleted market value of multifamily and residential tract projects however in the case of home construction loans to individuals the limit is with respect to commercial construction loans we typically lend up to of the estimated ascompleted market value of the property credit risk is also managed through the loan disbursement process loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and as warranted by inspection reports provided to us by our own lending officers andor consulting engineers to minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing each of our credits is secured with a perfected first security interest or outright ownership in the underlying collateral and structured as senior debt or as a noncancellable lease to further minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing we reunderwrite each transaction in addition we retain outside counsel to conduct a further review of the underlying documentation other ci loans are typically underwritten on the basis of the cash flows produced by the borrowers business and are generally collateralized by various business assets including but not limited to inventory equipment and accounts receivable as a result the capacity of the borrower to repay is substantially dependent on the degree to which the business is successful furthermore the collateral underlying the loan may depreciate over time may not be conducive to appraisal and may fluctuate in value based upon the operating results of the business accordingly personal guarantees are also a normal requirement for other ci loans the procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are generally consistent across all categories with late charges assessed and notices mailed to the borrower at specified dates we attempt to reach the borrower by telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment when contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure or recovery against collateral property we attempt to obtain full payment and will consider a repayment schedule to avoid taking such action delinquencies are addressed by our loan workout unit and every effort is made to collect rather than initiate foreclosure proceedings the following table presents our loans to days past due by

multifamily commercial real estate onetofour family acquisition development and construction nm other loans nm total loans days past due table end fair values for all multifamily buildings cre properties and land are determined based on the appraised value if an appraisal is more than one year old and the loan is classified as either nonperforming or as an accruing tdr then an updated appraisal is required to determine fair value estimated disposition costs are deducted from the fair value of the property to determine estimated net realizable value in the instance of an outdated appraisal on an impaired loan we adjust the original appraisal by using a thirdparty index value to determine the extent of impairment until an updated appraisal is received while we strive to originate loans that will perform fully adverse economic and market conditions among other factors can negatively impact a borrowers ability to repay historically our level of chargeoffs has been relatively low in downward credit cycles even when the volume of nonperforming loans has increased in we recorded a net recovery of million as compared to net chargeoffs of million in the previous year taxi medallionrelated net chargeoffs accounted for million of this years amount compared to million of last years amount partially reflecting the net recoveries noted above and the provision of million for the allowance for loan losses the allowance for losses on loans increased million equaling million at december from million at december reflecting the decrease in nonperforming loans cited earlier in this discussion the allowance for credit losses represented of nonperforming loans at december as compared to at the prior yearend based upon all relevant and available information at the

commercial building in woodhaven new york troubled debt restructurings in an effort to proactively manage delinquent loans we have selectively extended such concessions as rate reductions and extensions of maturity dates as well as forbearance agreements to certain borrowers who have experienced financial difficulty in accordance with gaap we are required to account for such loan modifications or restructurings as tdrs the eligibility of a borrower for workout concessions of any nature depends upon the facts and circumstances of each transaction which may change from period to period and involve managements judgment regarding the likelihood that the concession will result in the maximum recovery for the company loans modified as tdrs are placed on nonaccrual status until we determine that future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured this generally requires that the borrower demonstrate performance according to the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months at december loans modified as tdrs totaled million including accruing loans of million and nonaccrual loans of million at the prior yearend loans modified as tdrs totaled million

with which forbearance agreements were reached amounted to million and million at the respective dates based on the number of loans performing in accordance with their revised terms our success rate for restructured cre loans was for onetofour loans it was at the end of this december our success rate for other loans was at that date on a limited basis we may provide additional credit to a borrower after the loan has been placed on nonaccrual status or modified as a tdr if in managements judgment the value of the property after the additional loan funding is greater than the initial value of the property plus the additional loan funding amount in no such additional credit was provided furthermore the terms of our restructured loans typically would not restrict us from cancelling outstanding commitments for other credit facilities to a borrower in the event of nonpayment of a restructured loan for additional information about our tdrs at december and see the discussion of asset quality in note loans and leases in item financial statements and supplementary data except for the nonaccrual loans and tdrs disclosed in this filing we did not have any potential problem loans at december that would have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of a borrower to comply with present loan repayment terms and that would have resulted in such disclosure if that were the case loan deferrals under us gaap banks are required to assess modifications to a loans terms for potential classification as a tdr a loan to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty is classified as a tdr when a lender grants a concession that it would otherwise not consider such as a payment deferral or interest concession in order to encourage banks to work with impacted borrowers the cares act and bank regulators have provided relief from tdr accounting the main benefits of tdr relief include a capital benefit in the form of reduced riskweighted assets as tdrs are more heavily riskweighted for capital purposes aging of the loans is frozen ie they will continue to be reported in the same delinquency bucket they were in at the time of modification and the loans are generally not reported as nonaccrual during the modification period under the cares act the company made the election to deem that loan modifications do not result in tdrs if they are related to the novel coronavirus disease covid19 executed on a loan that was not more than days past due as of december and executed between march and the earlier of a days after the date of termination of the covid19 national emergency declaration or b december in december congress amended the cares act through the consolidated appropriations act of which provided additional covid19 relief to american families and businesses including extending tdr relief under the cares act the cares act expired on december during the second quarter of the company implemented various loan modification programs with some of its borrowers in accordance with the cares act and interagency regulatory guidance these modifications were primarily full payment deferrals for an initial six month period with the ability to extend again at the end of the deferral period at the banks discretion most of these deferrals were entered into during april and may and were therefore they were eligible to come off of their deferral period beginning in the fourth quarter of and the remaining were eligible to come off their deferral during the first quarter of accordingly at december of the companys fullpayment deferrals had returned to payment status in addition to the fullpayment deferrals the company entered into certain modifications whereby the borrowers are paying interest and escrow only at december principal

that the portion of the allowance for losses on loans allocated to each loan category does not represent the total amount available to absorb losses that may occur within that category since the total

other corporate uses dividends paid to the parent company by the bank capital raised through the issuance of securities funding raised through the issuance of debt instruments and repayments of and income from investment securities on a consolidated basis our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources retail institutional and brokered deposits borrowed funds primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans and cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities in loan repayments and sales generated cash flows of billion as compared to billion in cash flows from repayments accounted for billion and billion of the respective totals and cash flows from sales accounted for million and million in and respectively in cash flows from the repayment securities totaled billion while the purchase of securities amounted to billion for the year by comparison cash flows from the repayment

into the production of multifamily loans held for investment as well as heldforinvestment cre loans and specialty finance loans and leases deposits total deposits increased billion or on a yearoveryear basis to billion deposit growth was driven by growth in savings accounts and noninterest bearing accounts and offset by a decline in cds compared to the fourth quarter of last year cds declined billion or to billion while savings accounts increased billion or to billion and interest bearing checking and money market accounts increased over the same timeframe by million or to billion noninterestbearing accounts rose billion or to billion at december while the vast majority of our deposits are retail in nature ie they are deposits we have gathered through our branches or through

billion at yearend municipal deposits represented million of total deposits at the end of this december a million decrease from the balance at december included in total deposits at yearend were billion in loanrelated deposits compared to billion at yearend total deposits at december also included billion of deposits related to our banking as a service initiative which was launched earlier in depending on their availability and pricing relative to other funding sources we also include brokered deposits in our deposit mix brokered deposits accounted for billion of our deposits at the end of this december compared to billion at december brokered money market accounts represented billion of total brokered deposits at december and billion at december brokered interestbearing checking accounts represented billion and billion respectively at the corresponding dates at december we had billion of brokered cds compared to billion at december the following table indicates the amount of

end our uninsured deposits on an unconsolidated basis are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the fdic insurance limit currently were approximately billion and billion at december and respectively these amounts were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting purposes borrowed funds the majority of our borrowed funds are wholesale borrowings and consist of fhlbny advances repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased and to a lesser extent junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes at december total borrowed funds increased million or to billion compared to the balance at december the bulk of the yearoveryear increase was driven by an increase in the balance of wholesale borrowings wholesale borrowings wholesale borrowings totaled billion and billion respectively at december and representing of total assets at both dates fhlbny advances accounted for billion of the yearend balance as compared to billion at the prior yearend pursuant to blanket collateral agreements with the bank our fhlbny advances and overnight advances are secured by pledges of certain eligible collateral in the form of loans and securities for more information regarding our fhlbny advances see the discussion that appears earlier in this report regarding our membership and our ownership of stock in the fhlbny at december and billion of our wholesale borrowings had callable features also included in wholesale borrowings were repurchase agreements of million at december and repurchase agreements are contracts for the sale of securities owned or borrowed by the bank with an agreement to repurchase those securities at agreedupon prices and dates our repurchase agreements are primarily collateralized by gse obligations and may be entered into with the fhlbny or certain brokerage firms the brokerage firms we utilize are subject to an ongoing internal financial review to ensure that we borrow funds only from those dealers whose financial strength will minimize the risk of loss due to default in addition a master repurchase agreement must be executed and on file for each of the brokerage firms we use we had no federal funds purchased at both december and junior subordinated debentures junior subordinated debentures totaled million at december slightly higher than the balance at the prior yearend reflecting discount accretion subordinated notes at december the balance of subordinated notes was million relatively unchanged from december see note borrowed funds in item financial statements and supplementary data for a further discussion of our wholesale borrowings our junior subordinated debentures and subordinated debt liquidity contractual obligations and offbalance sheet commitments and capital position liquidity we manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand we monitor our liquidity daily to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet our financial obligations our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents which totaled billion and billion respectively at december and as in the past our loan and securities portfolios provided meaningful liquidity in with cash flows from the repayment and sale of loans totaling billion and cash flows from the repayment and sale of securities totaling billion additional liquidity stems from deposits and from our use of wholesale funding sources including brokered deposits and wholesale borrowings in addition we have access to the banks approved lines of credit with various counterparties including the fhlbny the availability of these wholesale funding sources is generally based on the amount of mortgage loan collateral available under a blanket lien we have pledged to the respective institutions and to a lesser extent the amount of available securities that may be pledged to collateralize our borrowings at december our available borrowing capacity with the fhlbny was billion in addition the bank had availableforsale securities of billion of which billion is unpledged furthermore the bank has agreements with the frbny that enable it to access the discount window as a further means of enhancing their liquidity in connection with these agreements the bank has pledged certain loans and securities to collateralize any funds they may borrow at december the maximum amount the bank could borrow from the frbny was billion there were no borrowings against these lines of credit at december our primary investing activity is loan production and the volume of loans we originated for investment totaled billion in during this time the net cash used in investing activities totaled billion the net cash provided by our operating activities totaled million our financing activities provided net cash of billion cds due to mature or reprice in one year or less from december totaled billion representing of total cds at that date our ability to attract and retain retail deposits including cds depends on numerous factors including among others the convenience of our branches and our other banking channels our customers satisfaction with the service they receive the rates of interest we offer the types of products we feature and the attractiveness of their terms our decision to compete for deposits also depends on numerous factors including among others our access to deposits through acquisitions the availability of lowercost funding sources the impact of competition on pricing and the need to fund our loan demand the parent company is a separate legal entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity in addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases the parent company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to our stockholders as a delaware corporation the parent company is able to pay dividends either from surplus or in case there is no surplus from net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year the parent companys ability to pay dividends may also depend in part upon dividends it receives from the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends and other capital distributions to the parent company is generally limited by new york state banking law and regulations and by certain regulations of the fdic in addition the superintendent of the new york state department of financial services the superintendent the fdic and the frb for reasons of safety and soundness may prohibit the payment of dividends that are otherwise permissible by regulations under new york state banking law a new york statechartered stockform savings bank or commercial bank may declare and pay dividends out of its net profits unless there is an impairment of capital however the approval of the superintendent is required if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of a banks net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years in the bank paid dividends totaling million to the parent company leaving million that it could dividend to the parent company without regulatory approval at yearend additional sources of liquidity available to the parent company at december included million in cash and cash equivalents if the bank was to apply to the superintendent for approval to make a dividend or capital distribution in excess of the dividend amounts permitted under the regulations there can be no assurance that such application would be approved contractual obligations and offbalance sheet commitments in the normal course of business we enter into a variety of contractual obligations in order to manage our assets and liabilities fund loan growth operate our branch network and address our capital needs for example we offer cds with contractual terms to our customers and borrow funds under contract from the fhlbny and various brokerage firms these contractual obligations are reflected in the consolidated statements of condition under deposits and borrowed funds respectively at december we had cds of billion and longterm debt defined as borrowed funds with an original maturity one year or more of billion we also are obligated under certain noncancelable operating leases on the buildings and land we use in operating our branch network and in performing our backoffice responsibilities these obligations are included in the consolidated statements of condition and totaled million at december at december we also had commitments to extend credit in the form of mortgage and other loan originations as well as commercial performance standby and financial standby letters of credit totaling billion these offbalance sheet commitments consist of agreements to extend credit as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract under which the loan is made commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee the letters of credit we issue consist of performance standby financial standby and commercial letters of credit financial standby letters of credit primarily are issued for the benefit of other financial institutions municipalities or landlords on behalf of certain of our current borrowers and obligate us to guarantee payment of a specified financial obligation performance standby letters of credit are primarily issued for the benefit of local municipalities on behalf of certain of our borrowers performance letters of credit obligate us to make payments in the event that a specified third party fails to perform under nonfinancial contractual obligations commercial letters of credit act as a means of ensuring payment to a seller upon shipment of goods to a buyer although commercial letters of credit are used to effect payment for domestic transactions the majority are used to settle payments in international trade typically such letters of credit require the presentation of documents that describe the commercial transaction and provide evidence of shipment and the transfer of title the fees we collect in connection with the issuance of letters of credit are included in fee income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income based upon our current liquidity position we expect that our funding will be sufficient to fulfill these cash obligations and commitments when they are due both in the short term and long term for the year ended december we did not engage in any offbalance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows at december we had no commitments to purchase securities capital position as reflected in the following table our capital measures continued to exceed the

leverage capital table end at december the capital ratios for the company and the bank continued to exceed the levels required for classification as well capitalized institutions as defined under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of and as further discussed in note capital in item financial statements and supplementary data results of operations as compared to net interest income net interest income is our primary source of income its level is a function of the average balance of our interestearning assets the average balance of our interestbearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities these factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interestearning assets and our interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by various external factors including the local economy competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the fomc and market interest rates the cost of our deposits and borrowed funds is largely based on shortterm rates of interest the level of which is partially impacted by the actions of the fomc the fomc reduces maintains or increases the target federal funds rate the rate at which banks borrow funds overnight from one another as it deems necessary while the target federal funds rate generally impacts the cost of our shortterm borrowings and deposits the yields on our heldforinvestment loans and other interestearning assets are typically impacted by intermediateterm market interest rates another factor that impacts the yields on our interestearning assetsand our net interest incomeis the income generated by our multifamily and cre loans and securities when they prepay since prepayment income is recorded as interest income an increase or decrease in its level will also be reflected in the average yields as applicable on our loans securities and interestearning assets and therefore in our net interest income our net interest rate spread and our net interest margin it should be noted that the level of prepayment income on loans recorded in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay during that time such activity is largely dependent on such external factors as current market conditions including real estate values and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates in addition while a decline in market interest rates may trigger an increase in refinancing and therefore prepayment income so too may an increase in market interest rates it is not unusual for borrowers to lock in lower interest rates when they expect or see that market interest rates are rising rather than risk refinancing later at a still higher interest rate for the twelve months ended december net interest income totaled billion up million or compared to the twelve months ended december the yearoveryear improvement was driven by a significant decline in interest expense due to lower funding costs modestly offset by a yielddriven decline of million in interest income yearoveryear comparison the following factors contributed to the yearoveryear increase in net interest income interest income on mortgage and other loans net totaled billion down million compared to fullyear while interest income on securities declined million to million compared to last year this was partially offset by a million increase on interest income related to cash and cash equivalents interest income on mortgages and other loans net was driven by a billion or increase in average loan balances to billion offset by a bps decrease in the average loan yield to from in interest income on securities was negatively impacted by a bps decline in the average yield to from offset by a million or increase in the average securities balance to billion average interestearning cash and cash equivalent balances more than doubled during fullyear to billion compared to billion during fullyear while the average yield rose four bps to interest expense on average interestbearing deposits declined million or to million during fullyear driven by a bps decrease in the average cost of interestbearing deposits while the average balance of interestbearing deposits rose million or to billion interest expense on borrowed funds declined million or to million despite an million or increase in the average balance to billion the average cost of borrowed funds declined bps to during fullyear net interest margin the direction of the companys net interest margin was consistent with that of its net interest income and generally was

measure should be disclosed in this report and other investor communications for the following reasons adjusted net interest margin gives investors a better understanding of the effect of prepayment income on our net interest margin prepayment income in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay or securities that prepay during that period such activity is largely dependent on external factors such as current market conditions including real estate values and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates adjusted net interest margin is among the measures considered by current and prospective investors both independent of and in comparison with our peers adjusted net interest margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net interest margin which is calculated in accordance with gaap moreover the manner in which we calculate this nongaap measure may differ from that of other companies reporting a nongaap measure with a similar name the following table sets forth certain information regarding our average balance sheet for the years indicated including the average yields on our interestearning assets and the average costs of our interestbearing liabilities average yields are calculated by dividing the interest income produced by the average balance of interestearning assets average costs are calculated by
