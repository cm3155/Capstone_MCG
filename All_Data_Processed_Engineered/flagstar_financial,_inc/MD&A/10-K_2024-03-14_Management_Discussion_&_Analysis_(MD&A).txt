item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations table end executive summary at december total assets were billion up billion compared to december total deposits were billion at december up billion from december these yeartodate increases were primarily due to our march assumption of a substantial amount of the deposits and certain identified

totaled for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december the net loss for primarily reflects a goodwill impairment of billion recorded in the fourth quarter partially offset by a billion bargain gain on the signature transaction during the fourth quarter of management also took decisive actions to build capital reinforce our balance sheet strengthen our risk management processes and better align ourselves with the relevant bank peers we significantly built our reserve levels by recording a million provision for loan losses bringing our allowance for credit losses to million at december reflecting our actions to build reserves during the quarter to address weakness in the office sector potential repricing risk in the multifamily portfolio and conditions leading to increases in classified assets which better aligns the company with its relevant bank peers including category iv banks in addition we added onbalance sheet liquidity as we prepare for the enhanced prudential standards that apply to banks with billion or more in total assets loan portfolio at december total ci loans were billion compared to billion at december the majority of the increase is attributable to the billion of ci loans acquired in the signature transaction along with continued growth through new originations the multifamily loan portfolio was billion at december down slightly

signature transaction and due to organic loan growth along with the impact of higher interest rates asset quality at december npa to total assets equaled percent compared to percent at december while npl to total loans equaled percent compared to percent at december the increase in npls was primarily driven by a million increase in multifamily loans and a million in commercial real estate loans repossessed assets of million were slightly higher compared to million in the prior year recent events declaration of dividend on common shares on january the companys board of directors declared a

company appointed alessandro sandro dinello as executive chairman effective as of february in this capacity mr dinello serves as the most senior executive officer of the company results of operations net interest income net interest income is our primary source of income its level is a function of the average balance of our interestearning assets the average balance of our interestbearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities these factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interestearning assets and our interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by various external factors including the local economy competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the fomc and market interest rates the cost of our deposits and borrowed funds is largely based on shortterm rates of interest the level of which is partially impacted by the actions of the fomc while the target federal funds rate generally impacts the cost of our shortterm borrowings and deposits the yields on our heldforinvestment loans and other interestearning assets are not as sensitive to intermediateterm market interest rates another factor that impacts the yields on our interestearning assetsand our net interest incomeis the income generated by our multifamily and cre loans and securities when they prepay since prepayment income is recorded as interest income an increase or decrease in its level will also be reflected in the average yields as applicable on our loans securities and interestearning assets and therefore in our net interest income our net interest rate spread and our net interest margin it should be noted that the level of prepayment income on loans recorded in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay during that time such activity is largely dependent on such external factors as current market conditions including real estate values and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates this impact is most prevalent in our multifamily and cre portfolios and to a lesser extent in our ci and adc portfolios in addition while a decline in market interest rates may trigger an increase in refinancing and therefore prepayment income so too may an increase in market interest rates it is not unusual for borrowers to lock in lower interest rates when they expect or see that market interest rates are rising rather than risk refinancing later at a still higher interest rate the impact of prepayments on the current quarter and year was minimal yearoveryear comparison for the year ended december net interest income totaled billion up billion or percent compared to billion for the year ended december the yearoveryear increase was primarily the result of the flagstar acquisition which closed late last year and the signature transaction which closed in late march of this year interest income on mortgages and other loans increased billion driven by a billion or percent increase in average loan balances to billion this is primarily driven by the december acquisition of flagstar and the march signature transaction

prepayments in were million interest income on securities increased million driven by a basis point increase in the average yield to percent from percent along with a billion or percent increase in the average securities balance to billion the increase was driven by higher rates on new purchase and higher yields on acquired flagstar securities interestearning cash and cash equivalents increased million reflecting a basis point increase in the average yield to percent driven by higher shortterm market rates and an increase in the average balance driven by the signature transaction and bolstering our onbalance sheet liquidity interest expense on average interestbearing deposits increased billion to billion during the year ended december driven by a basis point increase in the average cost of interestbearing deposits due to rising interest rates average interest earning deposits grew billion or percent to billion the balance growth primarily reflects the december

residential apartment buildings in new york city that feature rentregulated units and belowmarket rents the multifamily loan portfolio was billion at december down slightly compared to billion at december due to a combination of higher interest rates and our loan diversification strategy the majority of our multifamily loans were secured by rental apartment buildings at december billion or

regulation approximately percent are currently in an interest only period the weighted average ltv of the new york state rent regulated multifamily portfol io was percent as of december as compared to percent at december in addition to underwriting multifamily loans on the basis of the buildings income and condition we consider the borrowers credit history profitability and building management expertise borrowers are required to present evidence of their ability to repay the loan from the buildings current rent rolls their financial statements and related documents while a percentage of our multifamily loans are tenyear fixed rate credits the vast majority of our multifamily loans feature a term of ten or twelve years with a fixed rate of interest for the first five or seven years of the loan and an alternative rate of interest in years six through ten or eight through twelve the rate charged in the first five or seven years is generally based on intermediateterm interest rates plus a spread during the remaining years the loan resets to an annually adjustable rate that is indexed to cme term sofr or prime plus a spread alternately the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that is tied to the fiveyear fixed advance rate of the fhlbny plus a spread the fixedrate option also requires the payment of one percentage point of the thenoutstanding loan balance in either case the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial fiveor sevenyear term as the rent roll increases the typical property owner seeks to refinance the mortgage and generally does so before the loan reprices in year six or eight multifamily loans that refinance within the first five or seven years are typically subject to an established prepayment penalty schedule depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the thencurrent loan balance if a loan extends past the fifth or seventh year and the borrower selects the fixedrate option the prepayment penalties typically reset to a range of five points to one point over years six through ten or eight through twelve for example a tenyear multifamily loan that prepays in year three would generally be expected to pay a prepayment penalty equal to three percentage points of the remaining principal balance a twelveyear multifamily loan that prepays in year one or two would generally be expected to pay a penalty equal to five percentage points because prepayment penalties assessed to the borrower are recorded as interest income they are reflected in the average yields on our loans and interestearning assets our net interest rate spread and net interest margin and the level of net interest income we record no assumptions are involved in the recognition of prepayment income as such income is recorded when the cash is received our success as a multifamily lender partly reflects the solid relationships we have developed with the markets leading mortgage brokers and generational direct relationships who are familiar with our lending practices our underwriting standards and our longstanding practice of basing our loans on the cash flows produced by the properties the process of producing such loans is generally four to six weeks in duration we primarily underwrite our multifamily loans based on the current cash flows produced by the collateral property with a reliance on the income approach to appraising the properties rather than the sales approach we also consider a variety of other factors including the physical condition of the underlying property the net operating income of the mortgaged premises prior to debt service the dscr which is the ratio of the propertys net operating income to its debt service and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value ie the ltv of the property in addition to requiring a minimum dscr of percent on multifamily buildings at origination we obtain a security interest in the personal property located on the premises and an assignment of rents and leases our multifamily loans generally represent no more than percent of the lower of the appraised value or the sales price of the underlying property and typically feature an amortization period of years in addition our multifamily loans may contain an initial interestonly period which typically does not exceed two years however these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis exceptions to these levels are made to borrowers on a case by case basis and approved by the joint authority of credit and lending officers and when necessary the board credit committee of the board we continue to monitor our loans held for investment portfolio and the related allowance for credit losses particularly given the economic pressures facing the commercial real estate and multifamily markets in general buildings that are subject to rent regulation have historically tended to be stable with occupancy levels remaining more or less constant over time because the rents are typically below market and the buildings securing our loans are generally maintained in good condition they have been more likely to retain their tenants in adverse economic times in addition we generally exclude any shortterm property tax exemptions and abatement benefits the property owners receive when we underwrite our multifamily loans the following table presents a geographical analysis of the multifamily loans in our heldforinvestment loan portfolio table start at december multifamily loans in

the terms of more than half of our cre loans primarily feature a fixed rate of interest for the first five years of the loan that is generally based on intermediateterm interest rates plus a spread in addition to customary fixed rate terms we now also offer floating rates advances indexed to cme term sofr these products are generally offered in combination with interest rate cap or swaps that provide borrowers with additional optionality to manage their interest rate risk following the initial fixed rate period the loan resets to an adjustable interest rate that is indexed to cme term sofr or prime plus a spread alternately the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that is tied to the fiveyear fixed advance rate of the fhlbny plus a spread the fixedrate option also requires the payment of an amount equal to one percentage point of the thenoutstanding loan balance in either case the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial five or sevenyear term prepayment penalties apply to certain of our cre loans depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the thencurrent loan balance if a loan extends past the fifth or seventh year and the borrower selects the fixed rate option the prepayment penalties typically reset to a range of five points to one point over years six through ten or eight through twelve we originate cre loans in adherence with underwriting standards and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the propertys current income stream and dscr the approval of a loan primarily depends on the borrowers credit history profitability and expertise in property management and generally requires a minimum dscr of percent and a maximum ltv of percent in addition the origination of cre loans typically requires a security interest in the fixtures equipment and other personal property of the borrower andor an assignment of the rents andor leases in addition certain of our cre loans may contain an interestonly period which typically does not exceed three years however these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing

percent of total loans held for investment reflecting an increase of million compared to december because adc loans are generally considered to have a higher degree of credit risk especially during a downturn in the credit cycle borrowers are required to provide a guarantee of repayment and completion the risk of loss on an adc loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial appraisal of the propertys value upon completion of construction the developers experience the estimated cost of construction including interest and the estimated time to complete andor sell or lease such property when applicable as a condition to closing an adc loan it is our practice to require that properties meet presale or prelease requirements prior to funding ci loans at december ci loans totaled billion or percent of total loans heldforinvestment included in this portfolio is billion in warehouse loans that allow mortgage lenders to fund the closing of residential mortgage loans the nonwarehouse ci loans we produce are primarily made to small and midsize businesses and finance companies such loans are tailored to meet the specific needs of our borrowers and include term loans demand loans revolving lines of credit and to a much lesser extent loans that are partly guaranteed by the small business administration a broad range of ci loans both collateralized and unsecured are made available to businesses for working capital including inventory and accounts receivable business expansion the purchase of machinery and equipment and other general corporate needs in determining the term and structure of ci loans several factors are considered including the purpose the collateral and the anticipated sources of repayment ci loans are typically secured by business assets and personal guarantees of the borrower and include financial covenants to monitor the borrowers financial stability also included in our ci portfolio is our national warehouse lending platform with relationship managers across the country we offer warehouse lines of credit to other mortgage lenders which allow the lender to fund the closing of residential mortgage loans each extension advance or drawdown on the line is fully collateralized by residential mortgage loans and is paid off when the lender sells the loan to an outside investor or in some instances to the bank underlying mortgage loans are predominantly originated using the agencies underwriting standards the guideline for debt to tangible net worth is to at december we had billion outstanding warehouse loans to other mortgage lenders and have relationships in place to lend up to billion at our discretion the interest rates on our ci loans can be fixed or floating with floatingrate loans being tied to sofr prime or some other market index plus an applicable spread our floatingrate loans may or may not feature a floor rate of interest the decision to require a floor on ci loans depends on the level of competition we face for such loans from other institutions the direction of market interest rates and the profitability of our relationship with the borrower specialty finance at december specialty finance loans and

administration sba loans to this increase we classify loans as held for sale when we originate or purchase loans that we intend to sell we have elected the fair value option for nearly all of this portfolio except the sba loans we estimate the fair value of mortgage loans based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans where available or by discounting estimated cash flows using observable inputs inclusive of interest rates prepayment speeds and loss assumptions for similar collateral credit quality a loan generally is classified as a nonaccrual loan when it is days or more past due or when it is deemed to be impaired because we no longer expect to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status we cease the accrual of interest owed and previously accrued interest is reversed and charged against interest income at december and december all of our nonperforming loans were nonaccrual loans a loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is current and we have reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible we monitor nonaccrual loans both within and beyond our primary lending area in the same manner monitoring loans generally involves inspecting and reappraising the collateral properties holding discussions with the principals and managing agents of the borrowing entities and retain legal counsel as applicable requesting financial operating and rent roll information confirming that hazard insurance is in place or forceplacing such insurance monitoring tax payment status advancing funds as needed and seeking approval from the courts to appoint a receiver when necessary to protect the banks interests including to collect rents manage property operations and ensure maintenance of the collateral properties it is our policy to order updated appraisals for all nonperforming loans days or more past due that are collateralized by multifamily buildings cre properties or land if the most recent appraisal on file for the property is more than one year old appraisals are ordered annually until such time as the loan becomes performing and is returned to accrual status it is not our policy to obtain updated appraisals for performing loans however appraisals may be ordered for performing loans when a borrower requests an increase in the loan amount a modification in loan terms or an extension of a maturing loan nonperforming loans are reviewed regularly by management and discussed on a monthly basis with the board credit committee and the board of directors of the bank as applicable in accordance with our chargeoff policy collateraldependent nonperforming loans are written down to their current appraised values less certain transaction costs workout specialists from our loan workout unit actively pursue borrowers who are delinquent in repaying their loans in an effort to collect payment in addition outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to institute such action with regard to such borrowers properties and other assets that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as repossessed assets and are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition less the estimated cost of selling the property subsequent declines in the fair value of the assets are charged to earnings and are included in noninterest expense it is our policy to require an appraisal and an environmental assessment of properties classified as oreo before foreclosure and to reappraise the properties on an asneeded basis and not less than annually until they are sold we dispose of such properties as quickly and prudently as possible given current market conditions and the propertys condition to mitigate the potential for credit losses we underwrite our loans in accordance with credit standards that we consider to be prudent in the case of multifamily and cre loans we look first at the consistency of the cash flows being generated by the property to determine its economic value using the income approach and then at the market value of the property that collateralizes the loan the amount of the loan is then based on the lower of the two values with the economic value more typically used the condition of the collateral property is another critical factor multifamily buildings and cre properties are inspected from rooftop to basement as a prerequisite to approval furthermore independent appraisers whose appraisals are carefully reviewed by our experienced inhouse appraisal officers and staff perform appraisals on collateral properties in addition we work with a select group of mortgage brokers who are familiar with our credit standards and whose track record with our lending officers is typically greater than ten years furthermore in new york city where the majority of the buildings securing our multifamily loans are located the rents that tenants may be charged on certain apartments are typically restricted under certain rentcontrol or rentstabilization laws as a result the rents that tenants pay for such apartments are generally lower than current market rents buildings with a preponderance of such rentregulated apartments are less likely to experience vacancies in times of economic adversity to further manage our credit risk our lending policies limit the amount of credit granted to any one borrower and typically require minimum dscrs of percent for multifamily loans and percent for cre loans at origination we typically lend up to percent of the appraised value on multifamily buildings and up to percent on commercial properties exceptions to these dscr and ltv limitations are minimal and approved by the joint authority of credit and lending officers and when necessary the board credit committee of the board with regard to adc loans we typically lend up to percent of the estimated ascompleted market value of multifamily and residential tract projects however in the case of home construction loans to individuals the limit is percent with respect to commercial construction loans we typically lend up to percent of the estimated ascompleted market value of the property credit risk is also managed through the loan disbursement process loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and as warranted by inspection reports provided to us by our own lending officers andor consulting engineers to minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing each of our credits is secured with a perfected first security interest or outright ownership in the underlying collateral and structured as senior debt or as a noncancellable lease to further minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing we reunderwrite each transaction in addition we retain outside counsel to conduct a further review of the underlying documentation other ci loans generally represent loans to commercial businesses which meet certain desired client characteristics and credit standards the credit standards for commercial borrowers are based on numerous criteria including historical and projected financial information strength of management acceptable collateral and market conditions and trends in the borrowers industry these loans are generally variable rate loans in which the interest rate fluctuates with a specified index rate the procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are generally consistent across all categories with late charges assessed and notices mailed to the borrower at specified dates we attempt to reach the borrower by telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment when contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure or recovery against collateral property we attempt to obtain full payment and will consider a repayment schedule to avoid taking such action delinquencies are addressed by our loan workout unit and every effort is made to collect rather than initiate foreclosure proceedings fair values for all multifamily buildings cre properties and land are determined based on the appraised value if an appraisal is more than one year old and the loan is classified as either nonperforming or as an accruing tdm then an updated appraisal is required to determine fair value estimated disposition costs are deducted from the fair value of the property to determine estimated net realizable value in the instance of an outdated appraisal on an impaired loan we adjust the original appraisal by using a thirdparty index value to determine the extent of impairment until an updated appraisal is received asset quality measures the

we enter into a variety of contractual obligations in order to manage our assets and liabilities fund loan growth operate our branch network and address our capital needs these obligations include commitments to extend credit in the form of mortgage and other loan originations as well as commercial performance standby and financial standby letters of credit these commitments consist of agreements to extend credit as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract under which the loan is made commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee the letters of credit we issue consist of performance standby financial standby and commercial letters of credit financial standby letters of

december we did not engage in any offbalance sheet transactions that we expect to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows at december we had no commitments to purchase securities regulatory capital the bank is subject to regulation examination and supervision by the occ and the federal reserve the regulators the bank is also governed by numerous federal and state laws and regulations including the fdic improvement act of which established five categories of capital adequacy ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized such classifications are used by the fdic to determine various matters including prompt corrective action and each institutions fdic deposit insurance premium assessments capital amounts and classifications are also subject to the regulators qualitative judgments about the components of capital and risk weightings among other factors the quantitative measures established to ensure capital adequacy require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of leverage capital to average assets and of common equity tier capital tier capital and total capital to riskweighted assets as such measures are defined in the regulations at december our capital measures continued to exceed the minimum federal requirements for a bank holding company and for a bank the following table sets forth

tier riskbased capital ratio of percent a minimum total riskbased capital ratio of percent and a minimum leverage capital ratio of percent on july the federal banking agencies the fdic the federal reserve and the occ released a notice of proposed rulemaking that would make significant amendments to the basel iii capital rules applicable to both the company and the bank in general the proposed rule would align the regulatory capital calculation methodology for category iii and iv banking organizations with the methodology applicable to category i and ii banking organizations in addition to calculating riskweighted assets under the current us standardized approach the proposal introduces a new expanded riskbased approach including standardized approaches for credit risk operational risk and credit valuation adjustment risk as well as a new approach for market risk that would be based upon internal models and standardized supervisory models if adopted as proposed the company would be required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the current us standardized approach and the expanded riskbased approach and would be subject to the lower of the two resulting ratios for each riskbased capital ratio in addition the proposal would require banking organizations to recognize most elements of aoci in regulatory capital including unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale securities and lower thresholds for deductions from cet1 capital for mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets among other things the proposal if enacted would have an effective date of july with certain elements such as the recognition of aoci in regulatory capital and changes in riskweighted assets calculated under the expanded riskbased approach having a threeyear phasein period we are in the process of evaluating this proposed rulemaking and assessing its potential impact on the company and the bank if adopted as proposed reportable segment and reporting unit in our chief operating decision maker assessed performance and allocated resources at the consolidated company level following the acquisition of flagstar bank na and closing the signature transaction we are currently in the process of operationalizing the financial reporting both historical and prospective for our reportable segments and reporting units which may result in a change to either or both in future reporting periods critical accounting estimates various elements of our accounting policies by their nature are subject to estimation techniques valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments certain accounting policies that due to the judgment estimates and assumptions are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements and the notes are described in item these policies relate to a the determination of our acl b fair value measurements and c the acquisition method of accounting we believe the judgment estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the notes are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time however given the sensitivity of our consolidated financial statements and the notes to these critical accounting policies the use of other judgments estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in our results of operations andor financial condition allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases represents our current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded lending commitments management estimates the allowance by projecting and multiplying together the probabilityofdefault lossgivendefault and exposureatdefault depending on economic parameters for each month of the remaining contractual term as well as credit ratings for certain loans within the commercial and industrial portfolio the loss drivers for certain loans in the commercial and industrial portfolio are derived using credit ratings the economic forecast and the related economic parameters are developed using multiple economic forecast scenarios including related weightings over the reasonable and supportable forecast period the economic forecast scenarios and related economic parameters are sourced from independent third parties economic parameters are developed using available information relating to past events current conditions and economic forecasts historical credit loss experience over the historical loss observation period provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses with qualitative adjustments made for differences in current loanspecific risk characteristics such as levels of and trends in delinquencies and performance of loans levels of and trends in writeoffs and recoveries collected trends in volume and terms of loans effects of any changes in reasonable and supportable economic forecasts effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards and other changes in lending policies procedures and practices experience ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff available relevant information sources that support or contradict the registrants own forecast effects of changes in prepayment expectations or other factors affecting assessments of loan contractual term industry conditions and effects of changes in credit concentrations expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans adjusted for forecasted prepayments when appropriate the methodology used in the estimation of the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases which is performed at least quarterly is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and forecasted economic conditions each quarter the company reassesses the appropriateness of the economic forecasting period the reversion period and historical mean the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist the portfolio segment represents the level at which a systematic methodology is applied to estimate credit losses management believes the products within each of the entitys portfolio segments exhibit similar risk characteristics smaller pools of homogenous financing receivables with homogeneous risk characteristics were modeled using the methodology selected for the portfolio segment the company leverages economic projections including property market and prepayment forecasts from established independent third parties to inform its loss drivers in the forecast as well as credit ratings for certain loans within the commercial and industrial portfolio loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis including nonaccrual loans if a loan is determined to be collateral dependent or meets the criteria to apply the collateral dependent practical expedient expected credit losses are determined based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date less costs to sell as appropriate the company maintains an allowance for credit losses on offbalance sheet credit exposures the company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the company the allowance for credit losses on offbalance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit losses expense the estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over their estimated life the company examined historical credit conversion factor ccf trends to estimate utilization rates and chose an appropriate mean ccf based on both management judgment and quantitative analysis quantitative analysis involved examination of ccfs over a range of fundup windows between and months and comparison of the mean ccf for each fundup window with management judgment determining whether the highest mean ccf across fundup windows made business sense the company applies the same standards and estimated loss rates to the credit exposures as to the related class of loans when applying this critical accounting estimate we incorporate several inputs and judgments that may be influenced by changes period to period these include but are not limited to changes in the economic environment and forecasts changes in the credit profile and characteristics of the loan portfolio property valuations and changes in prepayment assumptions while changes to the economic environment forecasts and portfolio characteristics will change from period to period portfolio prepayments are an integral assumption in estimating the allowance for credit losses on our commercial real estate portfolio multi family cre and adc which comprises percent of the loan portfolio at december portfolio prepayments are subject to estimation uncertainty and changes in this assumption could have a material impact to our estimation process prepayment assumptions are sensitive to interest rates and existing loan terms and determine the weighted average life of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio excluding other factors as the weighted average life of the portfolio increases or decreases so will the required amount of the allowance for credit losses on commercial real estate valuation of mortgage servicing rights we purchase and originate mortgage loans for sale to the secondary market and often retain the right to service the loan at the time of sale upon which a mortgage servicing right msr is created we have elected to report our msr assets at fair value which is determined using an internal valuation model that utilizes an optionadjusted spread constant prepayment rates costs to service and other assumptions the assumptions used in the msr valuation are unobservable in nature involve a higher degree of judgment and are estimated based on our judgment regarding the value that market participants would assign to the asset to corroborate this estimate we obtain thirdparty valuations of the msr portfolio on a quarterly basis from independent valuation services to assess the reasonableness of the fair value calculated by the internal valuation model for further information and sensitivity analysis regarding the valuation of the msr asset see note mortgage servicing rights in item financial statements and supplementary data acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method of accounting requires that acquired assets and liabilities in a business combination be recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date this method often involves estimates all of which are inherently subjective we have elected to hold the measurement period open to allow for potential adjustments for up to one year after the acquisition date for new information that existed at the acquisition date but may not have been known or available at that time for further information refer to note business combinations in item financial statements and supplementary data goodwill the company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually or when triggering events are identified we utilize a market approach to calculate the fair value of our single reporting unit which considers how a market participant would view a control premium complemented by an income approach if deemed necessary the resulting value is then compared to our book value and any shortfalls would be recorded as an impairment as of december the company identified a triggering event and applied a market approach using the end of day stock price control premium for completed bank acquisitions and an adjustment for companyspecific risk considerations based on subsequent confirming market evidence this adjusted market capitalization was then compared to the carrying value to determine the extent of any shortfall which was calculated to be in excess of the goodwill balance the companys assessment concluded that goodwill from historical transactions and prior was fully impaired as of december as confirmed by the companys current market
