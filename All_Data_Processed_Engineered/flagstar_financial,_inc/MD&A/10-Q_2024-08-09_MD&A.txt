item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background new york community bancorp inc is a bank holding company collectively with its subsidiaries the company whose principal operation is its subsidiary flagstar bank na the bank the company has experienced a number of events in the last months that have significantly impacted its balance sheet results of operations credit losses liquidity and funding and regulatory capital at the end of the company acquired and merged with flagstar bancorp inc which increased assets by billion and liabilities by billion in march the company acquired billion of assets and assumed billion of liabilities from the fdic related to the former signature bridge bank these transactions resulted in the company exceeding billion in total assets which results in being categorized as a category iv institution for regulatory purposes increasing requirements and expectations related to liquidity risk management and governance beginning in late the companys loan portfolio began to experience stress related principally to vacancydriven declines in the office sector and inflation and high interest rates in the multifamily sector particularly for the subset of the companys loan portfolio comprised of majority rentregulated collateral a portion of which is impacted by a new york law change concerns about the impact of these portfolio stresses led to significant declines in the companys stock price and large customer deposit withdrawals in the first quarter of in response to these declines the company raised billion in equity capital in march through the issuance of shares of the companys common stock and preferred stock convertible to common stock and raised liquidity through brokered deposits and wholesale funding the result of these events and conditions has led to a significantly lower net interest margin and higher loan loss provisions in subsequent to the march capital raise the companys customer deposit base stabilized grew substantially in the second quarter and has continued to increase subsequently to further simplify the companys operations reduce operational risk and begin transitioning to a more diversified regional bank as well as enhance its regulatory capital ratios and liquidity subsequent to the second quarter of the i company completed the sale of its warehouse lending portfolio approximately billion in assets and ii entered into a definitive agreement to sell its mortgage servicing subservicing and thirdparty origination activities these transactions will increase the companys common equity tier capital ratio by approximately basis points in aggregate upon consummation but will decrease interest income and fee income until the resulting capital has been redeployed by the company in lending and investing activities these decreases will be partially offset by decreases in expenses associated with the activities being sold results of operations the company reported a second quarter net loss of million compared to a net loss of million in the prior quarter net loss attributable to common stockholders for the second quarter was million or per diluted share compared to a net loss of million or per diluted share in the prior quarter as adjusted for mergerrelated expenses the net loss for the second quarter was

included a bargain purchase gain of billion arising from the signature transaction as adjusted for this item and for mergerrelated expenses net income for the first six months of was million and net income available to common stockholders was million or per diluted share net interest income net interest income is our primary source of income the amount of our net interest income is a function of the amount of interestearning assets we hold the manner in which we fund these assets including interestbearing liabilities and the spread between the interest rates we earn on assets and the interest rates we pay on liabilities these factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interestearning assets and our interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by various external factors including the local economy competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the federal open market committee and market interest rates our interestbearing liabilities are comprised of customer deposits and funds we borrow the average term of our fixed rate deposits is less than twelve months therefore the cost of our deposits and most of our borrowed funds is largely based on shortterm rates of interest the level of which is partially impacted by the actions of the federal open market committee the yields on our heldforinvestment loans and investment securities are generally more sensitive to intermediateterm market interest rates the following table sets forth certain information regarding our net interest income and average balance sheet for the periods indicated average yields are calculated by dividing the interest income produced by the average balance of interestearning assets average costs are calculated by dividing the interest expense produced

in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each includes the impact of nonaccrual loans comparison to prior quarter the companys net interest margin for the second quarter was percent down basis points compared to the first quarter the basis point reduction was mainly driven by an increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities as well as an increase in borrowings to support a higher level of onbalance sheet liquidity associated with regulatory requirements the increase in the cost of interestbearing liabilities was driven by a full quarter of the change in funding mix following the deposit mix shift and increase in wholesale borrowings that occurred during the first quarter the first quarter decline in lower rate deposits and increase in certificates of deposits along with the increase in borrowed funds was primarily driven by customer withdrawals of uninsured deposits following the credit rating agency downgrades of our companys debt and deposit ratings by thirdparty credit rating agencies in february and march these elevated withdrawals resulted in the company raising liquidity through brokered deposits and borrowings subsequent to the billion capital investment in march our customer deposits stabilized and in the second quarter customer deposits grew approximately billion we expect to utilize liquidity from the second quarter deposit growth continued deposit growth in the third quarter and asset sale transactions closing in the third quarter of to reduce short term and other borrowings a substantial portion of our loan portfolio have fixed rates through repricing dates which extend several years because most of these loans were originated when market rates were lower than present rates they have a negative impact to our net interest margin however upon reaching repricing option dates the resulting rate resets will increase our interest income if higher interest rates persist see table under loan maturity and repricing other factors affecting the amount of our net interest income for the second quarter include a billion increase in nonaccrual loans and the associated reversal of previously accrued interest income on those loans comparison to prior year to date for the first six months of net interest margin was percent down basis points compared to the first six months of the decrease was primarily the result of the impact of the customer deposit withdrawals in the first quarter and the resulting shift in deposit mix to higher cost certificates of deposit and wholesale borrowings other factors affecting net interest income for the first six months compared to the first six months include a billion increase in nonaccrual loans and the associated reversal of previously accrued interest income on those loans a billion increase in average loan balances driven by the assets acquired in the signature transaction that closed on march an increase in the average loan yield primarily due to the impact of multifamily loans repricing to higher rates upon reaching the end of their initial fixed rate periods a basis point increase in the average yield on investment securities driven by lower rate securities maturing and being replaced with higher rate securities consistent with the increase in market interest rates provision for credit losses comparison to prior quarter for the second quarter the provision for credit losses totaled million compared to a million provision for the first quarter the provision reflects an increase in chargeoffs principally relating to largerbalance office loans and the continuing impact of market conditions on the multifamily portfolio as higher rates and inflationary impacts persist net chargeoffs totaled million for the second quarter compared with million for the first quarter primarily driven primarily by an increase in classified office loans and receipt of appraisals on those loans comparison to prior year to date for the first six months of the provision for credit losses totaled million compared to a million provision for the first six months of the provision reflects substantial increases in the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases and chargeoffs during the current period principally related to risk rating downgrades on commercial real estate and multifamily loans with upcoming maturities or repricing for which the estimated property net operating income would not be sufficient to fully cover proforma debt service when applying current market rates and terms as well as underlying collateral value declines principally in the office portfolio net chargeoffs totaled million for the first six months of compared with a net recovery of million

quarter the bargain purchase gain reduction recorded in the first quarter represented the final measurement period adjustment related to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the signature transaction loss on loan administration activities was million for the second quarter compared to income of million for the first quarter driven by a million increase in interest paid on subservicing custodial deposits and a million decrease in servicing income that was driven by the conclusion of our servicing agreement with the fdic related to the signature transaction in march as a result of the companys third quarter agreement to sell its mortgage servicing subservicing and thirdparty origination activities substantially all income associate with servicing rights gain on loan sales and loan administration income will cease upon consummation of the transaction which is expected in early fourth quarter comparison to prior year to date the decrease in loan administration fee income was a result of an million increase in interest paid on subservicing custodial deposits and the conclusion of the fdic servicing agreement lower net gain on loan sales and securitizations

expense increased during the period due to an increase in the amount of criticized and classified loans and other factors affecting the assessment rate comparison to prior year to date total operating expenses for the first six months of were up million compared to the first six months of this increase was largely due to the signature transaction including an increase in the number of employees higher occupancy costs related to an increase in number of company locations and the higher regulatory costs described previously we expect our expenses will decrease approximately million per quarter related to the sale of the mortgage servicing subservicing and thirdparty origination activities upon consummation of those transactions income tax expense comparison to prior quarter for the second quarter the company reported an income tax benefit of million compared to a benefit of million for the first quarter the benefit for the second quarter was driven by the higher book loss for the

june compared to billion at december principally related to increasing onbalance sheet liquidity in cash and cash equivalents total loans and leases held for investment decreased billion to billion at

continuing efforts to diversify our portfolio as borrowers without a deposit relationship seek more favorable loan terms with other lenders our multifamily loans may contain an initial interestonly period which typically does not exceed two years however these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis including calculation of the debt service coverage ratio whether a borrower qualifies for an interestonly period is based on the individual credit profile of the borrower particularly the loantovalue of the property the majority of our multifamily loans are secured by rental apartment buildings at june billion or percent of the companys total multifamily loan portfolio was secured by properties in new york state many of which are subject to rent regulation laws to varying degrees the new york housing stability and tenant protection act of the act significantly limits the ability to increase rents on regulated apartments upon vacancy these limitations may reduce a borrowers ability to generate additional revenues on those units to offset higher operating expenses due to inflation and the current interest rate environment which could result in lower net operating income and could impact a borrowers ability to satisfy repayment obligations during the term of the loan in addition the level of income generated by the property may be insufficient to qualify for refinancing at maturity the impact on current and future cash flows has adversely impacted the value of properties with a high concentration of rent regulated units which has increased chargeoffs in to mitigate our exposure to rent regulated properties we are curtailing future originations of loans secured by rentregulated properties and focusing originations and renewal retention on borrowers with whom we will have broader customer relationships beyond lending property values in this loan sector have decreased substantially since origination due to unfavorable market conditions the appraised value used in our loantovalue ratio is determined using an income approach to estimate the stabilized value of the collateral by applying a market driven capitalization rate to the stabilized cash flow of the property our multifamily loan portfolio had billion outstanding with an interestonly payment at june the weighted average interestonly period remaining was months as of june with approximately percent of these loans entering their amortization period by the end of we continue to monitor our loans held for investment portfolio and the related allowance for credit losses particularly given the economic pressures facing the commercial real estate and multifamily markets although occupancy levels have historically tended to be stable due to below market rents rentregulated loans that are repricing are incurring debt service levels that when combined with inflationary pressure on operating costs and limits on the ability to increase rental rates approach or exceed some properties net operating income and may require the borrower to support the loan from sources unrelated to the collateral until elevated interest rates subside the following table presents

with credit standards that we consider to be prudent as described more fully in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december credit quality it is our practice to continually review the risk in our loan portfolio the company receives financial information from borrowers annually and most of the financial information is received in the second calendar quarter at june the company had received updated financial information on approximately percent of the multifamily loan portfolio upon receipt of updated borrower financial information we perform an analysis to determine whether the cash flow from the underlying collateral is sufficient to meet the contractual loan payments commonly referred to as the debt service coverage ratio we consider the ability to cover debt service based upon the current contractual rate or where a borrowers initial fixed rate period expires within months the lowest contractual rate reset option available under the loan terms using the current level for referenced indices loans for which the collateral does not have a debt service coverage ratio of or higher under this analysis are rated substandard we order appraisals for all substandard loans where an appraisal does not support recovery of the loan carrying amount for collateraldependent loans we classify the loan as nonaccrual regardless of payment status and charge the loan down to its recoverable amount once an appraisal is ordered it takes approximately two to three months to receive and appropriately review the results nonaccrual loans are evaluated at least quarterly to determine if an adjustment to the amount of impairment is required loans that are on nonaccrual and separately the largest individual nonaccrual borrowers are reported and reviewed with the credit committee of the board of directors at least quarterly the company conducted a thorough review of its largest real estate loans at the end of the first quarter of this review continued in the second quarter of to cover approximately pe rcent of the unpaid principal balance of the commercial real estate and multifamily portfolio classified loans increased billion in the second quarter of and billion in the first quarter of these downgrades were principally related to loans with upcoming maturities or repricing where the estimated net operating income of the property would not be sufficient to fully cover proforma debt service when applying current market rates and terms or the underlying collateral values are estimated to have declined to at or below the loan carrying amount classified loans reflect the potential that a loss may occur if deficiencies in the primary source of repayment are unable to be corrected and borrowers are unwilling or unable to otherwise support the loans refer to note in item financial statements and supplementary data for additional details the procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are generally consistent across all categories with late charges assessed and notices mailed to the borrower at specified dates we attempt to reach the borrower by telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment when contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure or recovery against collateral property we attempt to obtain full payment and will consider a repayment schedule to avoid taking such action delinquencies are addressed by our loan workout unit and every effort is made to collect rather than initiate foreclosure proceedings a loan generally is classified as a nonaccrual loan when it is days or more past due or when it is deemed to be impaired because we no longer expect to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement when a loan is in nonaccrual we cease recording interest income on the loan previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against interest income and any subsequent interest collected is recorded as a reduction in the loan carrying amount a loan is returned to accrual status only when the loan is current and we have reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible at june billion of nonaccrual loans were current based on their existing payment terms in accordance with our chargeoff policy collateraldependent loans are written down to their current appraised values less certain transaction costs workout specialists from our loan workout unit actively pursue borrowers who are delinquent in repaying their loans in an effort to collect payment in addition outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to support these efforts chargeoffs of million were recorded on commercial real estate and multifamily loans during the six months ended june primarily driven by appraisals received on those loans it is our policy to order updated appraisals for nonaccrual loans that are collateralized by multifamily buildings commercial real estate properties or land if the most recent appraisal on file for the property is more than one year old appraisals are ordered at least annually until such time as the loan becomes performing and is returned to accrual status it is not our policy to obtain updated appraisals for performing loans that are not showing signs of credit weakness however appraisals may be ordered for performing loans when a borrower requests an increase in the loan amount a modification in loan terms or an extension of a maturing loan or when we determine an updated appraisal is needed as a result of our ongoing credit analysis we evaluate loans that were previously placed on nonaccrual at least quarterly to determine if additional chargeoffs may be needed properties and other assets that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as repossessed assets and are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition less the estimated cost of selling the property subsequent declines in the fair value of the assets are charged to earnings and are included in noninterest expense it is our policy to require an appraisal and an environmental assessment of properties classified as other real estate owned before foreclosure and to reappraise the properties on an asneeded basis and not less than annually until they are sold we dispose of such properties as quickly and prudently as possible given current market conditions and the propertys condition asset quality measures all asset quality information excludes loans with government guarantees that are insured by us government agencies the following

of our nonaccrual loans are current on their contractual payment terms in determining whether to place a loan on nonaccrual we have considered whether a borrower will be able to service its debt under terms expected within the next months based on current collateral and net operating income where net operating income is below the projected debt service and the collateral value is below the loan amount we place loans on nonaccrual updated financial information from borrowers and appraisals received have led to an increase in nonaccruals loans in the following table sets forth the changes in

persistently high which will put pressure on the ability for certain borrowers with interest rates resetting at current levels to cover debt service when combined with inflationary pressure on operating costs and limits on the ability to increase rental rates debt service levels may approach or exceed some properties net operating income which increases the risk of loss we believe that higher interest rates for a longer period of time will have a more significant impact on our loans that will reprice during the next months therefore we have incorporated a higher probability of default related to those loans as they approach their scheduled repricing date in the measurement of our allowance for credit losses our allowance for credit losses is determined based on quantitative modeling that incorporates and weighs various economic forecast scenarios the key inputs to our quantitative allowance for credit losses models include borrowers projected debt service based on the most recent financial information available and underlying collateral property values property values are particularly meaningful for our multifamily and commercial real estate portfolios our models consider the entire life of the loan including both the interest only period of the loan if applicable and the amortization period to assess the probability of default and the loss given default for our multifamily portfolio we obtain and utilize current and projected geographyspecific market information in our forecasts in estimating the qualitative component of our allowance for credit losses we have adjusted key inputs used by the model on an average basis for certain loans most notably net operating income and property values to reflect weaknesses in the underlying data including the recency of appraisal values and the lack of significant loss history in available data particularly for multifamily loans the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases to total loans held for

temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand on a consolidated basis our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources retail institutional and brokered deposits borrowed funds primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans and cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities bank liquidity and sources of funding we monitor our liquidity daily and more frequently during times of stress our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents additional liquidity stems from deposits wholesale funding sources including wholesale borrowings and brokered deposits and approved lines of credit with various counterparties including the fhlb these funding sources depend on the amount of mortgage loan collateral and available securities pledged the bank also has agreements with the federal reserve bank to access the discount window pledging certain loans and securities as collateral the following table summarizes our total liquidity from onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet funding sources in billions june december cash at federal reserve highquality liquid assets total onbalance sheet liquidity fhlb available capacity discount window available capacity total liquidity at june our total liquidity cash and cash equivalents highquality liquid assets and borrowing capacity was billion the billion increase in cash and cash equivalents was driven by actions to further bolster our liquidity position subsequent to june the company completed the sale of its warehouse loan portfolio further increasing available liquidity by approximately billion deposits our ability to retain and attract deposits depends on numerous factors including customer satisfaction the rates of interest we pay the types of products we offer and the attractiveness of their terms the majority of our deposits are retail in nature ie they are deposits we have gathered through our branches or through business combinations however we also utilize brokered deposits depending on their availability and pricing relative to other funding sources from december to march we experienced billion in core deposit attrition following the credit rating agency downgrades of our companys credit and deposit ratings in february and march on march we announced a billion capital raise after which deposits stabilized we replaced the decline in deposits and increased our onbalance sheet liquidity primarily through brokered certificates of deposit and wholesale borrowings the following table presents the composition of the companys brokered deposits june december brokered money market accounts brokered interestbearing checking accounts represented brokered certificates of deposit total brokered deposits excludes reciprocal deposits the following table indicates the amount of time deposits by account that are in excess of the fdic insurance limit currently by time remaining until maturity in millions june december portion of us time deposits in excess of insurance limit time deposits otherwise uninsured with a maturity of months or less over months through months over months through months over months total time deposits otherwise uninsured the following table indicates the amount of custodial deposits by source in billions june december custodial deposits from owned servicing custodial deposits from subservicing relationships nonservicing custodial deposits uninsured deposits we manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand as a result we have total liquidity of billion which exceeds the balance of our uninsured deposits by billion our uninsured deposits are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the fdic insurance limit currently these amounts were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting purposes and exclude internal accounts at june our deposit base includes billion of uninsured deposits uninsured deposits decreased following our earnings announcement in january and subsequent credit rating agency downgrades of our credit ratings in february and march our customer deposits stabilized following the announcement of the billion capital raise in march and subsequently increased billion in the second quarter credit ratings we maintain credit ratings from three rating agencies moodys fitch and morningstar dbrs as of each of the dates indicated our credit ratings were as follows june december june longterm issuer rating moodys b2 baa3 baa3 fitch bb bbb bbb morningstar dbrs bbb low bbb high bbb high shortterm deposits rating moodys np p2 p2 the primary mortgage loan agencies maintain standards that define the criteria that must be met for an institution to qualify as an eligible custodial depository for the deposits related to loans owned by those entities including have an investment grade shortterm issuerdeposit rating from moodys or sp we are currently not in compliance with that criteria we have received a waiver of these criteria for all of our custodial deposits which could be revoked at any of the agencies discretion we have no other direct contractual relationships tied to further downgrades in our credit ratings but may suffer reputational risk that could have an adverse effect on our business should that occur contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business we enter into a variety of contractual obligations in order to manage our assets and liabilities fund loan growth operate our branch network and address our capital needs for example we offer certificates of deposit with contractual terms to our customers and borrow funds under contract from the fhlb these contractual obligations are reflected in the consolidated statements of condition under deposits and borrowed funds respectively at june we had certificates of deposit of billion and longterm debt defined as borrowed funds with an original maturity one year or more of billion we also are obligated under certain noncancelable operating leases on the buildings and land we use in operating our branch network and in performing our backoffice responsibilities these obligations are included in the consolidated statements of condition in other liabilities and totaled million at june a decrease of million compared to million at december at june we also had commitments to extend credit in the form of mortgage and other loan originations as well as commercial performance standby and financial standby letters of credit these commitments consist of agreements to extend credit as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract under which the loan is made commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee the fees we collect in connection with the issuance of letters of credit are included in fee income in the consolidated statements of loss income and comprehensive loss income based upon our current cash and cash equivalent balance of billion and our total liquidity position of billion we expect that our funding will be sufficient to fulfill these cash obligations and commitments when they are due both in the short term and long term for the second quarter we did not engage in any offbalance sheet transactions that we expect to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows at june and december we had no commitments to purchase securities parent company liquidity the parent company is a separate legal entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity at june the parent company held cash and cash equivalents of million in addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases the parent company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to our common and preferred stockholders various legal restrictions limit the extent to which the companys subsidiary bank can supply funds to the parent company and its nonbank subsidiaries the bank would require the approval of the office of the comptroller of the currency if the dividends it declares in any calendar year were to exceed the total of its respective net profits for that year combined with its respective retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years less any required transfer to paidin capital the term net profits is defined as net income for a given period less any dividends paid during that period as a result of our acquisition of flagstar we are also required to seek regulatory approval from the office of the comptroller of the currency for the payment of any dividend to the parent company through at least the period ending november in connection with receiving regulatory approval from the office of the comptroller of the currency for the signature transaction the bank has committed that i for a period of two years from the date of the signature transaction it will not declare or pay any dividend without receiving a prior written determination of no supervisory objection from the office of the comptroller of the currency and ii it will not declare or pay dividends on the amount of retained earnings that represents any net bargain purchase gain that is subject to a conditional period that may be imposed by the office of the comptroller of the currency in the first six months of dividends of million were paid by the bank to the parent company we have reduced our quarterly cash dividends to common stockholders to per common share and we do not anticipate material dividends from the bank to the parent company in the near future until the company is able to achieve a return to repeatable operating income at june we believe the company has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations through interest rate risk as a financial institution we are focused on reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility which represents our primary market risk changes in market interest rates represent the greatest challenge to our financial performance as such changes can have a significant impact on the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and on the market value of all interestearning assets other than those possessing a short term to maturity to reduce our exposure to changing rates the board of directors and management monitor interest rate sensitivity on a regular or as needed basis so that adjustments to the asset and liability mix can be made when deemed appropriate the actual duration of heldforinvestment mortgage loans and mortgagerelated securities can be significantly impacted by changes in prepayment levels and market interest rates the level of prepayments may in turn be impacted by a variety of factors including the economy in the region where the underlying mortgages were originated seasonal factors demographic variables and the assumability of the underlying mortgages however the factors with the most significant impact on prepayments are market interest rates and the availability of refinancing opportunities interest rate sensitivity analysis interest rate sensitivity is monitored through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in our economic value of equity eve over a range of interest rate scenarios eve is defined as the net present value of expected cash flows from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet contracts the eve ratio under any interest rate scenario is defined as the eve in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario the model assumes estimated loan and mortgagebacked securities prepayment rates current market value spreads and deposit decay rates and betas based on the information and assumptions in effect at june the following table sets forth our eve assuming the changes in interest rates noted change in interest rates in basis points estimated percentage change in economic value of equity shock shock shock shock the net changes in eve presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the boards of directors of the company and the bank during the second quarter of we terminated all of our derivatives that were designated in a cash flow or fair value hedge relationship this action reduced our asset sensitivity resulting in a relatively neutral position while the eve analysis provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and may very well differ from actual results interest rate risk is also monitored through the use of a model that generates net interest income nii simulations over a range of interest rate scenarios modeling changes in nii requires that certain assumptions be made which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates in this regard the nii analysis presented below assumes that the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities furthermore the model does not take into account the benefit of any strategic actions we may take to further reduce our exposure to interest rate risk the assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the following table due to the frequency timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories and prepayments among other factors coupled with any actions taken to counter the effects of any such changes based on the information and assumptions in effect at june the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in future net interest income for the next twelve months assuming the changes in interest rates noted change in interest rates in basis points estimated percentage change in future net interest income shock shock shock shock in general short and longterm rates are assumed to increase in parallel instantaneously and then remain unchanged the net changes in nii presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the boards of directors of the company and the bank future changes in our mix of assets and liabilities may result in greater changes to our eve andor nii simulations in the event that our eve and net interest income sensitivities were to breach our internal policy limits we would inform the board of directors and undertake actions to remediate generally through capital market transactions where temporary changes in market conditions or volume levels result in significant increases in risk strategies may involve reducing open positions or employing other balance sheet management activities including the potential use of derivatives to reduce the risk exposure where variance from policy tolerances is triggered by more fundamental imbalances in the risk profiles of core loan and deposit products a remedial strategy may involve restoring balance through natural hedges to the extent possible before employing synthetic hedging techniques other strategies might include asset restructuring involving sales of assets having higher risk profiles or a gradual restructuring of the asset mix over time to affect the maturity or repricing schedule of assets liability restructuring whereby product offerings and pricing are altered or wholesale borrowings are employed to affect the maturity structure or repricing of liabilities expansion or shrinkage of the balance sheet to correct imbalances in the repricing or maturity periods between assets and liabilities andor use or alteration of offbalance sheet positions including interest rate swaps caps floors options and forward purchase or sales commitments in connection with our net interest income simulation modeling we also evaluate the impact of changes in the slope of the yield curve at june our analysis indicated that a further inversion of the yield curve would be expected to result in a percent increase in net interest income conversely an immediate steepening of the yield curve would be expected to result in a percent decrease in net interest income regulatory capital the company is a bank holding company subject to regulation examination and supervision by the federal reserve the bank is national bank subject to regulation examination and supervision by the office of the comptroller of the currency the bank is subject to the prompt corrective action regulatory capital framework that establishes five categories of capital adequacy ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized an institutions

insurance premium assessments capital amounts and classifications are also subject to the regulators qualitative judgments about the components of capital and risk weighting assets among other factors and the regulators have discretion to require that institutions maintain capital in excess of minimum levels the quantitative measures established to ensure capital adequacy require that banks and bank holding companies maintain minimum amounts and ratios of leverage capital to average assets and of common equity tier capital tier capital and total capital to riskweighted assets as such measures are defined in the regulations at june our capital measures continued to exceed the minimum federal requirements for a bank holding company and for a bank the following tables set forth the

it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its residential mortgage servicing business including mortgage servicing rights and thirdparty origination platform to mr cooper a leading mortgage originator and servicer for approximately billion the transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of upon closing the company expects that the transaction will increase the common equity tier ratios approximately basis points other recent developments on november the fdic published in the federal register its final rule that imposes special assessments to recover the loss to the deposit insurance fund the fdic continues to provide an updated estimate of each institutions quarterly and total special assessment expense and while we expect this may result in an increase we do not expect the increase to be material the final rule calls for the fdic to collect special assessments over eight quarterly assessment periods beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of which was paid in june on july the federal banking agencies the fdic the federal reserve and the office of the comptroller of the currency released a notice of proposed rulemaking that would make significant amendments to the basel iii capital rules applicable to both the company and the bank in general the proposed rule would align the regulatory capital calculation methodology for category iii and iv banking organizations with the methodology applicable to category i and ii banking organizations in addition to calculating riskweighted assets under the current us standardized approach the proposal introduces a new expanded riskbased approach including standardized approaches for credit risk operational risk and credit valuation adjustment risk as well as a new approach for market risk that would be based upon internal models and standardized supervisory models if adopted as proposed the company and the bank would be required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the current us standardized approach and the expanded riskbased approach and would be subject to the lower of the two resulting ratios for each riskbased capital ratio in addition the proposal would require banking organizations to recognize most elements of aoci in regulatory capital including unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale securities and lower thresholds for deductions from cet1 capital for mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets among other things the proposal if enacted would have an effective date of july with certain elements such as the recognition of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital and changes in riskweighted assets calculated under the expanded riskbased approach having a threeyear phasein period we are in the process of evaluating this proposed rulemaking and assessing its potential impact on the company and the bank if adopted as proposed on august the federal banking agencies issued for public comment a proposal that would require large banks or those with more than billion in total consolidated assets to maintain a minimum amount of longterm debt ltd that can be used in the instance of a banks failure to absorb losses and increase options to resolve the failed bank under the proposal the required minimum amount of ltd would be the greater of percent of an entitys total riskweighted assets percent of an entitys average total consolidated assets or percent of an entitys total leverage exposure if it is subject to the supplementary leverage ratio debt instruments issued to satisfy the minimum ltd requirement would need to be unsecured have maturities greater than one year and have plain vanilla features eg no structured notes or credit sensitive instruments the proposal would further subject banks to certain clean holdingcompany requirements such as a prohibition on entering into derivatives with external counterparties the proposal would provide a threeyear transition period with the incremental phasein of the requirements during this period we identified certain material weaknesses in managements report on internal control over financial reporting included within item of our

market interest rates remain persistently high which will put pressure on the ability for certain borrowers with interest rates resetting at current levels to cover debt service when combined with inflationary pressure on operating costs and limits on the ability to increase rental rates debt service levels may approach or exceed some properties net operating income which increases the risk of loss we believe that higher interest rates for a longer period of time will have a more significant impact on our loans that will reprice during the next months therefore we have incorporated a higher probability of default related to those loans as they approach their scheduled repricing date in the measurement of our allowance for credit losses our allowance for credit losses is determined based on quantitative modeling that incorporates and weighs economic forecast scenarios the key inputs to our quantitative allowance for credit losses models include borrowers projected debt service based on the most recent financial information available and underlying collateral property values property values are particularly meaningful for our multifamily and commercial real estate portfolios our models consider the entire life of the loan including both the interest only period of the loan if applicable and the amortization period to assess the probability of default and the loss given default for our multifamily portfolio we obtain and utilize current and projected geographyspecific market information in our forecasts in estimating the qualitative component of our allowance for credit losses we have adjusted key inputs used by the model on an average basis for certain loans most notably net operating income and property values to reflect weaknesses in the underlying data including the recency of appraisal values and the lack of significant loss history in available data particularly for multifamily loans as of june and december the allowance for unfunded commitments totaled million and million respectively the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases to total loans held for investment ratio increased to percent at june compared to percent at december

lessor in the equipment finance business where it has executed direct financing leases lease finance receivables the company produces lease finance receivables through a specialty finance subsidiary that participates in syndicated loans that are brought to them and equipment loans and leases that are assigned to them by a select group of nationally recognized sources and are generally made to large corporate obligors many of which are publicly traded carry investment grade or nearinvestment grade ratings and participate in stable industries nationwide lease finance receivables are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the leased assets and any initial direct costs incurred to originate these leases less unearned income which is accreted to interest income over the lease term using the interest method the standard leases are typically repayable on a level monthly basis with terms ranging from to months at the end of the lease term the lessee usually has the option to return the equipment to renew the lease or purchase the equipment at the then fair market value fmv price for leases with a fmv renewalpurchase option the relevant residual value assumptions are based on the estimated value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term including evaluation of key factors such as the estimated remaining useful life of the leased asset its historical secondary market value including history of the lessee executing the fmv option overall credit evaluation and return provisions the company acquires the leased asset at fair market value and provides funding to the respective lessee at acquisition cost less any volume or trade discounts as applicable therefore there is generally no selling profit or loss to recognize or defer at inception of a lease the residual value component of a lease financing receivable represents the estimated fair value of the leased equipment at the end of the lease term in establishing residual value estimates the company may rely on industry data historical experience and independent appraisals and where appropriate information regarding product life cycle product upgrades and competing products upon expiration of a lease residual assets are remarketed resulting in either an extension of the lease by the lessee a lease to a new customer or purchase of the residual asset by the lessee or another party impairment of residual values arises if the expected fair value is less than the carrying amount the company assesses its net investment in lease financing receivables including residual values for impairment on an annual basis with any impairment losses recognized in accordance with the impairment guidance for financial instruments as such net investment in lease financing receivables may be reduced by an allowance for credit losses with changes recognized as provision expense on certain lease financings the company obtains residual value insurance from third parties to manage and reduce the risk associated with the residual value of the leased assets at june and december the carrying value of residual assets with thirdparty residual value insurance for at

the company has investments in mortgage servicing rights that result from the sale of loans to the secondary market for which we retain the servicing the company accounts for mortgage servicing rights at fair value a primary risk associated with mortgage servicing rights is the potential reduction in fair value as a result of higher than anticipated prepayments due to loan refinancing prompted in part by declining interest rates or government intervention conversely these assets generally increase in value in a rising interest rate environment to the extent that prepayments are slower than anticipated the company utilizes derivatives as economic hedges to offset changes in the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights resulting from the actual or anticipated changes in prepayments stemming from changing interest rate environments there is also a risk of valuation decline due to higher than expected default rates which we do not believe can be effectively managed using derivatives for further information regarding the derivative instruments utilized to manage our mortgage servicing rights risk see note derivative and hedging activities subsequent to june the company entered into an agreement to sell all of its mortgage servicing rights for an amount equal to their carrying amount at the date of the agreement see note subsequent events changes in the fair value of

prepayment rate weighted average cost to service per loan the sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear to isolate the effect of the specified change the fair value shock analysis is consistent with the identified adverse change while holding all other assumptions constant in practice a change in one assumption generally impacts other assumptions which may either magnify or counteract the effect of the change for further information on the fair value of mortgage servicing rights see note fair value measures contractual

from both its business operations and economic conditions the company principally manages its exposure to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities the company manages economic risks including interest rate and liquidity risks primarily by managing the amount sources and duration of its assets and liabilities and the use of derivative financial instruments specifically the company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts the value of which are determined by interest rates derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value in other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated statements of condition the companys policy is to present our derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the consolidated statements of condition on a gross basis even when provisions allowing for setoff are in place however for derivative contracts cleared through certain central clearing parties variation margin payments are recognized as settlements we are exposed to nonperformance risk by the counterparties to our various derivative financial instruments a majority of our derivatives are centrally cleared through a central counterparty clearing house or consist of residential mortgage interest rate lock commitments further limiting our exposure to nonperformance risk we believe that the nonperformance risk inherent in our remaining derivative contracts is minimal based on credit standards and the collateral provisions of the derivative agreements derivatives not designated as hedging instruments the company maintains a derivative portfolio of interest rate swaps foreign currency swaps futures swaptions and forward commitments used to manage exposure to changes in interest rates and mortgage servicing right asset values and to meet the needs of customers the company also enters into interest rate lock commitments which are commitments to originate mortgage loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding and the customers have locked into that interest rate market risk on interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held for sale is managed using corresponding forward sale commitments and us treasury futures changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recognized on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income during the three months ended june we dedesignated

analysis at inception and qualitatively thereafter unless regression analysis is deemed necessary fair value of hedges of interest rate risk the company is exposed to changes in the fair value of certain of its fixedrate assets due to changes in interest rates the company previously used interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value on these instruments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involved the payment of fixedrate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the company receiving variablerate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount such derivatives were used to hedge the changes in fair value of certain of its pools of prepayable fixed rate assets for derivatives previously designated and that qualified as fair value hedges the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk were recognized in interest income the fair value basis adjustments remaining from discontinued hedges are recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the hedged items for the six months ended june interest income from loans and leases in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income was increased by million due to the floating rate payments received on the swaps being greater than the fixed rate payments as well as the accretion of the fair value basis adjustment subsequent to discontinuance of the hedges the fair

generally accepted accounting principles sets forth a definition of fair value establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis us generally accepted accounting principles also clarifies that fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received when selling an asset or paid when transferring a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants fair value is thus a marketbased measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability as a basis for considering such assumptions us generally accepted accounting principles establishes a threetier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instrument level inputs to the valuation methodology are significant unobservable inputs that reflect a companys own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants use in pricing an asset or liability a financial instruments categorization within this valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the following tables present assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of june and

its assets on a quarterly basis changes from one quarter to the next that are related to the observability of inputs for a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification from one hierarchy level to another a description of the methods and significant assumptions utilized in estimating the fair values of securities follows where quoted prices are available in an active market securities are classified within level of the valuation hierarchy level securities include highly liquid government securities and exchangetraded securities if quoted market prices are not available for a specific security then fair values are estimated by using pricing models these pricing models primarily use marketbased or independently sourced market parameters as inputs including but not limited to yield curves interest rates equity or debt prices and credit spreads in addition to observable market information models incorporate transaction details such as maturity and cash flow assumptions securities valued in this manner would generally be classified within level of the valuation hierarchy and primarily include such instruments as mortgagerelated and corporate debt securities periodically the company uses fair values supplied by independent pricing services to corroborate the fair values derived from the pricing models in addition the company reviews the fair values supplied by independent pricing services as well as their underlying pricing methodologies for reasonableness the company challenges pricing service valuations that appear to be unusual or unexpected while the company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair values of certain financial instruments could result in different estimates of fair values at a reporting date fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs the following tables include a

available quoted market prices are used as the measure of fair value in cases where quoted market prices are not available fair values are based on presentvalue estimates or other valuation techniques such fair values are significantly affected by the assumptions used the timing of future cash flows and the discount rate because assumptions are inherently subjective in nature estimated fair values cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent market quotes furthermore in many cases the estimated fair values provided would not necessarily be realized in an immediate sale or settlement of

estimated fair values of cash and cash equivalents are assumed to equal their carrying values as these financial instruments are either due on demand or have shortterm maturities securities if quoted market prices are not available for a specific security then fair values are estimated by using pricing models quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows these pricing models primarily use marketbased or independently sourced market parameters as inputs including but not limited to yield curves interest rates equity or debt prices and credit spreads in addition to observable market information pricing models also incorporate transaction details such as maturities and cash flow assumptions federal home loan bank stock ownership in equity securities of the fhlb is generally restricted and there is no established liquid market for their resale the carrying amount approximates the fair value loans and leases the company discloses the fair value of loans measured at amortized cost using an exit price notion the company determined the fair value on substantially all of its loans for disclosure purposes on an individual loan basis the discount rates reflect current market rates for loans with similar terms to borrowers having similar credit quality on an exit price basis for those loans where a discounted cash flow technique was not considered reliable the company used a quoted market price for each individual loan mortgage servicing rights the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the mortgage servicing rights are option adjusted spreads prepayment rates and cost to service significant increases decreases in all three assumptions in isolation result in a significantly lower higher fair value measurement weighted average life in years is used to determine the change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights for june the weighted average life in years for the entire portfolio was rate lock commitments the significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the rate lock commitments is the pull through rate the pull through rate is a statistical analysis of our actual rate lock fallout history to determine the sensitivity of the residential mortgage loan pipeline compared to interest rate changes and other deterministic values new market prices are applied based on updated loan characteristics and new fallout ratios ie the inverse of the pull through rate are applied accordingly significant increases decreases in the pull through rate in isolation result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement deposits the fair values of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity ie interestbearing checking and money market accounts savings accounts and noninterestbearing accounts are equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand the fair values of certificates of deposit represent contractual cash flows discounted using interest rates currently offered on deposits with similar characteristics and remaining maturities these estimated fair values do not include the intangible value of core deposit relationships which comprise a portion of the companys deposit base borrowed funds the estimated fair value of borrowed funds is based either on bid quotations received from securities dealers or the discounted value of contractual cash flows with interest rates currently in effect for borrowed funds with similar maturities and structures offbalance sheet financial instruments the fair values of commitments to extend credit and unadvanced lines of credit are estimated based on an analysis of the interest rates and fees currently charged to enter into similar transactions considering the remaining terms of the commitments and the creditworthiness of the potential borrowers the estimated fair values of such offbalance sheet financial instruments were insignificant at june and december fair value option we elected the fair
