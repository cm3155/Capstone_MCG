item 2managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the purpose of this quarterly report on we did not have any potential problem loans at the end of the current quarter that would have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of a borrower to comply with present loan repayment terms and that would have resulted in such disclosure if that were the case loan deferrals under us gaap banks are required to assess modifications to a loans terms for potential classification as a tdr a loan to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty is classified as a tdr when a lender grants a concession that it would otherwise not consider such as a payment deferral or interest concession in order to encourage banks to work with impacted borrowers the cares act and bank regulators have provided relief from tdr accounting the main benefits of tdr relief include a capital benefit in the form of reduced riskweighted assets as tdrs are more heavily riskweighted for capital purposes aging of the loans is frozen ie they will continue to be reported in the same delinquency bucket they were in at the time of modification and the loans are generally not reported as nonaccrual during the modification period under the cares act the company made the election to deem that loan modifications do not result in tdrs if they are related to the novel coronavirus disease covid19 executed on a loan that was not more than days past due as of december and executed between march and the earlier of a days after the date of termination of the covid19 national emergency declaration or b december in december congress amended the cares act through the consolidated appropriation act of which provided additional covid19 relief to american families and businesses including extending tdr relief under the cares act until the earlier of december or days following the termination of the national emergency during the second quarter of the company implemented various loan modification programs with some of its borrowers in accordance with the cares act and interagency regulatory guidance these modifications were primarily full payment deferrals for an initial six month period with the ability to extend again at the end of the deferral period at the banks discretion most of these deferrals were entered into during april and may and were therefore they were eligible to come off of their deferral period beginning in the fourth quarter of and the remaining were eligible to come off their deferral during the first quarter of accordingly at march of the billion of loans on deferral had returned to payment status in addition approximately billion or of total loans have been modified and are currently paying interestonly and escrow principal deferrals the majority of these principal deferrals billion or are scheduled to resume principal payments during the second quarter of the remaining million are scheduled to resume

total nonperforming loans securities at march total securities increased million or annualized on a linkedquarter basis to billion compared to billion at december the purchase of securities has increased due to higher longterm interest rates and a steeper yield curve during the quarter at the end of the current first quarter total securities represented of total assets compared to at the fourth quarter of federal home loan bank stock as a member of the fhlbny the bank is required to acquire and hold shares of its capital stock and to the extent fhlb borrowings are utilized may further invest in fhlb stock at march and december the bank held fhlbny stock in the amount of million and million respectively fhlbny stock continued to be valued at par with no impairment required at that date dividends from the fhlbny to the bank totaled million and million respectively in the three months ended march and bankowned life insurance boli is recorded at the total cash surrender value of the policies in the consolidated statements of condition and the income generated by the increase in the cash surrender value of the policies is recorded in noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income reflecting an increase in the cash surrender value of the underlying policies our investment in boli increased million to billion at march from december goodwill we record goodwill in our consolidated statements of condition in connection with certain of our business combinations goodwill which is tested at least annually for impairment refers to the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of an acquired companys assets net of the liabilities assumed goodwill totaled billion at both march and december for more information about the companys goodwill see the discussion of critical accounting policies earlier in this report sources of funds the parent company ie the company on an unconsolidated basis has three primary funding sources for the payment of dividends share repurchases and other corporate uses dividends paid to the company by the bank capital raised through the issuance of stock and funding raised through the issuance of debt instruments on a consolidated basis our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources deposits borrowed funds primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings the cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans and the cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities loan repayments and sales totaled billion in the three months ended march up million from the billion recorded in the yearearlier three months cash flows from the repayment and sales of securities totaled million and million respectively in the corresponding periods while purchases of securities totaled million and million respectively deposits our ability to retain and attract deposits depends on numerous factors including customer satisfaction the rates of interest we pay the types of products we offer and the attractiveness of their terms from time to time we have chosen not to compete actively for deposits depending on our access to deposits through acquisitions the availability of lowercost funding sources the impact of competition on pricing and the need to fund our loan demand at march total deposits were billion up billion compared to december at the end of the current first quarter total deposits represented of total assets while cds represented of total deposits the majority or billion of this growth occurred in the noninterestbearing checking category as the company is currently working with its technology partners to bring in additional low cost deposits these deposits are shortterm in nature and related to individual spending patterns we expect these deposits to peak during the second quarter of and then run off over the next year included in the march balance of deposits were business institutional deposits of billion and municipal deposits of million as compared to billion and billion respectively at december brokered deposits remained stable at billion including brokered interest bearing checking of billion at march and december brokered money market accounts of billion at march and billion at december and brokered cds of million at march similar to the balance at december the extent to which we accept brokered deposits depends on various factors including the availability and pricing of such wholesale funding sources and the availability and pricing of other sources of funds borrowed funds borrowed funds consist primarily of wholesale borrowings ie fhlbny advances repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased and to a far lesser extent junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes as of march borrowed funds declined million or annualized to billion compared to december and represented of total assets at that date the decrease was mainly due to a decline in wholesale borrowings consisting primarily of fhlbny advances which declined to billion compared to billion at yearend also included in wholesale borrowings are repurchase agreements of million unchanged from the balance at december subordinated notes on november the company issued million aggregate principal amount of its fixedtofloating rate subordinated notes due the company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes which may include opportunistic repurchases of shares of its common stock pursuant to its previously announced share repurchase program the notes were offered to the public at of their face amount at march the balance of subordinated notes was million which excludes certain costs related to their issuance junior subordinated debentures junior subordinated debentures totaled million at march comparable to the balance at december risk definitions the following section outlines the definitions of interest rate risk market risk and liquidity risk and how the company manages market and interest rate risk interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movements in interest rates interest rate risk arises from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows repricing risk from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting company activities basis risk from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities yield curve risk and from interestrelated options embedded in a banks products options risk the evaluation of interest rate risk must consider the impact of complex illiquid hedging strategies or products and also the potential impact on fee income eg prepayment income which is sensitive to changes in interest rates in those situations where trading is separately managed this refers to structural positions and not trading portfolios market risk market risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from changes in the value of portfolios of financial instruments this risk arises from marketmaking dealing and positiontaking activities in interest rate foreign exchange equity and commodities markets many banks use the term price risk interchangeably with market risk this is because market risk focuses on the changes in market factors eg interest rates market liquidity and volatilities that affect the value of traded instruments the primary accounts affected by market risk are those which are revalued for financial presentation eg trading accounts for securities derivatives and foreign exchange products liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from a banks inability to meet its obligations when they become due without incurring unacceptable losses liquidity risk includes the inability to manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources liquidity risk also arises from a banks failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect the ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value management of market and interest rate risk we manage our assets and liabilities to reduce our exposure to changes in market interest rates the asset and liability management process has three primary objectives to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts to determine the appropriate level of risk given our business strategy risk appetite operating environment capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and to manage that risk in a manner consistent with guidelines approved by the boards of directors of the company and the bank market and interest rate risk as a financial institution we are focused on reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility changes in interest rates pose one of the greatest challenges to our financial performance as such changes can have a significant impact on the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and on the market value of all interestearning assets other than those possessing a short term to maturity to reduce our exposure to changing rates the boards of directors and management monitor interest rate sensitivity on a regular or as needed basis so that adjustments to the asset and liability mix can be made when deemed appropriate the actual duration of heldforinvestment mortgage loans and mortgagerelated securities can be significantly impacted by changes in prepayment levels and market interest rates the level of prepayments may be impacted by a variety of factors including the economy in the region where the underlying mortgages were originated seasonal factors demographic variables and the assumability of the underlying mortgages however the largest determinants of prepayments are interest rates and the availability of refinancing opportunities we manage our interest rate risk by taking the following actions continue to emphasize the origination and retention of intermediateterm assets primarily in the form of multifamily and cre loans continue to originate certain floating rate ci loans depending on funding needs replace maturing wholesale borrowings with longer term borrowings and as needed execute interest rate swaps libor transition process on july the uk financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor announced that it will no longer request banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after on november the ice benchmark administration iba announced they will extend the publication of most us dollar libor usd libor through june the frb established the alternative reference rate committee arrc comprised of a group of private market participants and other members representing banks and financial sector regulators to identify a set of alternative reference rates for potential use as benchmarks the arrc has recommended the secured overnight financing rate or sofr as the preferred alternative rate to us dollar libor but financial institutions are permitted to select a different index for their products offered the bank has established a subcommittee of its alco to address issues related to the phaseout and ultimate transition away from libor to an alternate rate this subcommittee is led by our chief financial officer and consists of personnel from various departments throughout the bank including lending loan administration credit risk management financetreasury including interest rate risk and liquidity management information technology and operations the company has liborbased contracts that extend beyond june included in loans and leases securities wholesale borrowings derivative financial instruments and longterm debt the subcommittee has reviewed contract fallback language and noted that certain contracts will need updated provisions for the transition and is coordinating with impacted business lines in complying with industry requirements the bank will not offer new libor based production after december while the arrc has recommended sofr as the replacement for libor there is acknowledgment that the development of a credit sensitive element could be a complement to sofr at this time it is unclear as to the likelihood and timing of this occurring but such a development could have an impact on our transition efforts interest rate sensitivity analysis the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a banks interest rate sensitivity gap an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time frame if it will mature or reprice within that period of time the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interestearning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time frame and the amount of interestbearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same period of time in a rising interest rate environment an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected absent the effects of other factors to experience a greater increase in the cost of its interestbearing liabilities than it would in the yield on its interestearning assets thus producing a decline in its net interest income conversely in a declining rate environment an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected to experience a lesser reduction in the yield on its interestearning assets than it would in the cost of its interestbearing liabilities thus producing an increase in its net interest income in a rising interest rate environment an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to experience a greater increase in the yield on its interestearning assets than it would in the cost of its interestbearing liabilities thus producing an increase in its net interest income conversely in a declining rate environment an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to experience a lesser reduction in the cost of its interestbearing liabilities than it would in the yield on its interestearning assets thus producing a decline in its net interest income at march our oneyear gap was a negative compared to a negative at december the change in our oneyear gap from december primarily reflects a decrease in mortgage and other loans expected to mature or reprice within one year partially offset by an increase in interestearning cash and cash equivalents the table on the following page sets forth the amounts of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities outstanding at march which based on certain assumptions stemming from our historical experience are expected to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown except as stated below the amounts of assets and liabilities shown as repricing or maturing during a particular time period were determined in accordance with the earlier of the term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability the table provides an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at march on the basis of contractual maturities anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments within a threemonth period and subsequent selected time intervals for residential mortgagerelated securities prepayment rates are forecasted at a weighted average cpr of per annum for multifamily and cre loans prepayment rates are forecasted at weighted average cprs of and per annum respectively borrowed funds were not assumed to prepay savings interest bearing checking and money market accounts were assumed to decay based on a comprehensive statistical analysis that incorporated our historical deposit experience based on the results of this analysis savings accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of for the first five years and for years six through ten interestbearing checking accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of for the first five years and for years six through ten the decay assumptions reflect the prolonged low interest rate environment and the uncertainty regarding future depositor behavior including those accounts having specified repricing dates money market accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of for the first five years and for years six through ten at march  in thousands three months or less four to twelve months more than one year to three years more than three years to five years more than five years to years more

stock are shown at their respective carrying amounts 3expected amount based in part on historical experience 4the interest rate sensitivity gap per period represents the difference between interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities prepayment and deposit decay rates can have a significant impact on our estimated gap while we believe our assumptions to be reasonable there can be no assurance that the assumed prepayment and decay rates will approximate actual future loan and securities prepayments and deposit withdrawal activity to validate our prepayment assumptions for our multifamily and cre loan portfolios we perform a quarterly analysis during which we review our historical prepayment rates and compare them to our projected prepayment rates we continually review the actual prepayment rates to ensure that our projections are as accurate as possible since prepayments on these types of loans are not as closely correlated to changes in interest rates as prepayments on onetofour family loans tend to be in addition we review the call provisions if any in our borrowings and investment portfolios and on a monthly basis compare the actual calls to our projected calls to ensure that our projections are reasonable as of march the impact of a bp decline in market interest rates for our loans would have had very little impact on prepayment speeds due to the current low interest rates and current coupons being floored at base rates the impact of a bp increase in market interest rates would have decreased our projected prepayment rates for multifamily and cre loans by a constant prepayment rate of per annum certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding interest rate sensitivity analysis for example although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of the market while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates additionally certain assets such as adjustablerate loans have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a shortterm basis and over the life of the asset furthermore in the event of a change in interest rates prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in calculating the table also the ability of some borrowers to repay their adjustablerate loans may be adversely impacted by an increase in market interest rates interest rate sensitivity is also monitored through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in our economic value of equity eve over a range of interest rate scenarios eve is defined as the net present value of expected cash flows from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet contracts the eve ratio under any interest rate scenario is defined as the eve in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario the model assumes estimated loan prepayment rates reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates similar to those utilized in formulating the preceding interest rate sensitivity analysis based on the information and assumptions in effect at march the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in our eve assuming the changes in interest rates noted change in interest rates in basis points estimated percentage change in economic value of equity 1the impact of a bp and a bp reduction in interest rates is not presented in view of the current level of the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates the net changes in eve presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the boards of directors of the company and the bank as with the interest rate sensitivity analysis certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the preceding interest rate risk measurements modeling changes in eve requires that certain assumptions be made which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates in this regard the eve analysis presented above assumes that the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities furthermore the model does not take into account the benefit of any strategic actions we may take to further reduce our exposure to interest rate risk accordingly while the eve analysis provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and may very well differ from actual results we also utilize an internal net interest income simulation to manage our sensitivity to interest rate risk the simulation incorporates various marketbased assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on future levels of our financial assets and liabilities the assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the following table due to the frequency timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories and prepayments among other factors coupled with any actions taken to counter the effects of any such changes based on the information and assumptions in effect at march the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in future net interest income for the next twelve months assuming the changes in interest rates noted change in interest rates in basis points estimated percentage change in future net interest income 1in general short and longterm rates are assumed to increase in parallel fashion across all four quarters and then remain unchanged 2the impact of a bp and a bp reduction in interest rates is not presented in view of the current level of the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates future changes in our mix of assets and liabilities may result in greater changes to our gap npv andor net interest income simulation in the event that our eve and net interest income sensitivities were to breach our internal policy limits we would undertake the following actions to ensure that appropriate remedial measures were put in place our alco committee would inform the board of directors of the variance and present recommendations to the board regarding proposed courses of action to restore conditions to withinpolicy tolerances in formulating appropriate strategies the alco committee would ascertain the primary causes of the variance from policy tolerances the expected term of such conditions and the projected effect on capital and earnings where temporary changes in market conditions or volume levels result in significant increases in risk strategies may involve reducing open positions or employing synthetic hedging techniques to more immediately reduce risk exposure where variance from policy tolerances is triggered by more fundamental imbalances in the risk profiles of core loan and deposit products a remedial strategy may involve restoring balance through natural hedges to the extent possible before employing synthetic hedging techniques other strategies might include asset restructuring involving sales of assets having higher risk profiles or a gradual restructuring of the asset mix over time to affect the maturity or repricing schedule of assets liability restructuring whereby product offerings and pricing are altered or wholesale borrowings are employed to affect the maturity structure or repricing of liabilities expansion or shrinkage of the balance sheet to correct imbalances in the repricing or maturity periods between assets and liabilities andor use or alteration of offbalance sheet positions including interest rate swaps caps floors options and forward purchase or sales commitments in connection with our net interest income simulation modeling we also evaluate the impact of changes in the slope of the yield curve at march our analysis indicated that an immediate inversion of the yield curve would be expected to result in a decrease in net interest income conversely an immediate steepening of the yield curve would be expected to result in a increase in net interest income it should be noted that the yield curve changes in these scenarios were updated given the changing market rate environment which resulted in an increase in the income sensitivity liquidity we manage our liquidity to ensure that cash flows are sufficient to support our operations and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand we monitor our liquidity daily to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet our financial obligations our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents which totaled billion and billion respectively at march and december as in the past our portfolios of loans and securities provided liquidity in the first three months of the year with cash flows from the repayment and sale of loans totaling billion and cash flows from the repayment and sale of securities totaling million additional liquidity stems from the retail institutional and municipal deposits we gather and from our use of wholesale funding sources including brokered deposits and wholesale borrowings we also have access to the banks approved lines of credit with various counterparties including the fhlbny the availability of these wholesale funding sources is generally based on the available amount of mortgage loan collateral under a blanket lien we have pledged to the respective institutions and to a lesser extent the available amount of securities that may be pledged to collateralize our borrowings at march our available borrowing capacity with the fhlbny was billion in addition the company had billion of availableforsale securities at that date of which billion was unencumbered furthermore the bank has an agreement with the frbny that enables it to access the discount window as a further means of enhancing liquidity if need be in connection with the agreement the bank has pledged certain loans and securities to collateralize any funds that may be borrowed at march the maximum amount the bank could borrow from the frbny was billion there were no borrowings outstanding at that date our primary investing activity is loan production in the first three months of the volume of loans originated for investment was billion during this time the net cash used in investing activities totaled million our operating activities provided net cash of million while the net cash provided by our financing activities totaled billion cds due to mature in one year or less as of march totaled billion representing of total cds at that date our ability to retain these cds and to attract new deposits depends on numerous factors including customer satisfaction the rates of interest we pay on our deposits the types of products we offer and the attractiveness of their terms however there are times when we may choose not to compete for such deposits depending on the availability of lowercost funding the competitiveness of the market and its impact on pricing and our need for such deposits to fund loan demand as previously discussed the parent company is a separate legal entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity in addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases the parent company is responsible for paying dividends declared to our shareholders as a delaware corporation the parent company is able to pay dividends either from surplus or in case there is no surplus from net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year the parent companys ability to pay dividends may also depend in part upon dividends it receives from the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends and other capital distributions to the parent company is generally limited by new york state banking law and regulations and by certain regulations of the fdic in addition the superintendent of the new york state department of financial services the superintendent the fdic and the frb for reasons of safety and soundness may prohibit the payment of dividends that are otherwise permissible by regulations under new york state banking law a new york statechartered stockform savings bank or commercial bank may declare and pay dividends out of its net profits unless there is an impairment of capital however the approval of the superintendent is required if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of a banks net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years in the three months ended march the bank paid dividends totaling million to the parent company leaving million they could dividend to the parent company without regulatory approval at that date additional sources of liquidity available to the parent company at march included million in cash and cash equivalents if the bank was to apply to the superintendent for approval to make a dividend or capital distribution in excess of the dividend amounts permitted under the regulations there can be no assurance that such application would be approved capital position on march we issued  of preferred stock the offering generated capital of million net of underwriting and other issuance costs for general corporate purposes with the bulk of the proceeds being distributed to the bank on october the company announced that it had received regulatory approval to repurchase its common stock accordingly the board of directors approved a million common share repurchase program the repurchase program was funded through the issuance of a like amount of subordinated notes as of march the company has repurchased a total of million shares at an average price of or an aggregate purchase price of million leaving million remaining under the current authorization stockholders equity common stockholders equity and tangible common stockholders equity include aocl which decreased million from the balance at the end of last year and million from the yearago quarter to million at march the yeartodate decrease was primarily the result of a million change in the net unrealized gain loss on availableforsale securities net of tax and a million change in the net unrealized loss on cash flow hedges net of tax to million regulatory capital the bank is subject to regulation examination and supervision by the nysdfs and the fdic the regulators the bank is also governed by numerous federal and state laws and regulations including the fdic improvement act of which established five categories of capital adequacy ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized such classifications are used by the fdic to determine various matters including prompt corrective action and each institutions fdic deposit insurance premium assessments capital amounts and classifications are also subject to the regulators qualitative judgments about the components of capital and risk weightings among other factors the quantitative measures established to ensure capital adequacy require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of leverage capital to average assets and of common equity tier capital tier capital and total capital to riskweighted assets as such measures are defined in the regulations at march our capital measures continued to exceed the minimum federal requirements for a bank holding company and for a bank the following table sets forth our common equity tier tier riskbased total riskbased and leverage capital amounts and ratios on a consolidated basis and for the bank on a standalone basis as well as the respective minimum regulatory

minimum leverage capital ratio of earnings summary for the three months ended march net income for the three months ended march was million up compared to million for the three months ended march net income available to common shareholders for the three months ended march totaled million up compared to million for the three months ended march on a per share basis the company reported diluted earnings per common share of for the first quarter of up compared to the reported for the first quarter of net interest income net interest income is our primary source of income its level is a function of the average balance of our interestearning assets the average balance of our interestbearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities these factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interestearning assets and our interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by various external factors including the local economy competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the fomc and market interest rates net interest income is also influenced by the level of prepayment income primarily generated in connection with the prepayment of our multifamily and cre loans as well as securities since prepayment income is recorded as interest income an increase or decrease in its level will also be reflected in the average yields as applicable on our loans securities and interestearning assets and therefore in our interest rate spread and net interest margin it should be noted that the level of prepayment income on loans recorded in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay during that time such activity is largely dependent on such external factors as current market conditions including real estate values and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates in addition while a decline in market interest rates may trigger an increase in refinancing and therefore prepayment income so too may an increase in market interest rates it is not unusual for borrowers to lock in lower interest rates when they expect or see that market interest rates are rising rather than risk refinancing later at a still higher interest rate yearoveryear comparison net interest income for the three months ended march increased million or to million compared to the three months ended march this improvement was the result of a significant decline in the companys funding costs which resulted in a substantial decrease in interest expense this was offset by a decline in interest income details of the increase in net interest income follow interest income declined to million compared to the yearago quarter interest income on mortgage and other loans was million down compared to the first quarter of interest income on securities declined to million compared to the yearago quarter the decline in interest income on loans was due to lower loan yields offset by an increase in average balances loan yields declined bps to compared to the yearago quarter while average balances increased billion or compared to the yearago quarter in addition interest income from securities was similarly impacted by lower yields the yield on the securities portfolio declined bps to compared to the first quarter of total interest expense was million for the three months ended march down million or compared to the three months ended march this improvement was the result of a significant decline in the companys cost of funds the cost of funds declined bps to compared to the first quarter of last year the majority of the improvement was driven by a lower average cost of cds along with a decline in the average balance of cds the average cost of cds declined bps to while the average balance of cds decreased billion or to billion net interest margin the companys nim improved during the current first quarter inline with the growth in net interest income for the three months ended march the nim increased bps on a yearoveryear basis and one bp on a linkedquarter basis to for the three months ended march adjusted nim improved bps to compared to the prior
