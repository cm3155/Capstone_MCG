item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the purpose of this quarterly report on we did not have any potential problem loans at the end of the current quarter that would have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of a borrower to comply with present loan repayment terms and that would have resulted in such disclosure if

life insurance boli is recorded at the total cash surrender value of the policies in the consolidated statements of condition and the income generated by the increase in the cash surrender value of the policies is recorded in noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income reflecting an increase in the cash surrender value of the underlying policies our investment in boli increased million to billion at june from december goodwill we record goodwill in our consolidated statements of condition in connection with certain of our business combinations goodwill which is tested at least annually for impairment refers to the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of an acquired companys assets net of the liabilities assumed goodwill totaled billion at both june and december sources of funds the parent company ie the company on an unconsolidated basis has three primary funding sources for the payment of dividends share repurchases and other corporate uses dividends paid to the company by the bank capital raised through the issuance of stock and funding raised through the issuance of debt instruments on a consolidated basis our funding primarily stems from a combination of the following sources deposits borrowed funds primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings the cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans and the cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities loan repayments and sales totaled billion in the six months ended june up billion from the billion recorded in the yearearlier six months cash flows from the repayment and sales of securities totaled million and million respectively in the corresponding periods while purchases of securities totaled million and billion respectively deposits our ability to retain and attract deposits depends on numerous factors including customer satisfaction the rates of interest we pay the types of products we offer and the attractiveness of their terms from time to time we have chosen not to compete actively for deposits depending on our access to deposits through acquisitions the availability of lowercost funding sources the impact of competition on pricing and the need to fund our loan demand at june total deposits were billion up billion compared to total deposits at march and up billion since december at june total deposits represented of total assets compared to at march and at december additionally at june cds represented of total deposits versus at march and at december included in the june balance of deposits were business institutional deposits of billion and municipal deposits of million as compared to billion and million respectively at december also included in the june balance of deposits was billion of baasrelated deposits up billion from december brokered deposits remained stable at billion including brokered interestbearing checking accounts of million at june and billion at december brokered money market accounts of billion at june and billion at december and brokered cds of billion at june and billion at december the extent to which we accept brokered deposits depends on various factors including the availability and pricing of such wholesale funding sources and the availability and pricing of other sources of funds the following table indicates the amount of time deposits by account that are in excess of the fdic insurance limit currently by time remaining until maturity as of june june  in millions portion of us time deposits in excess of insurance limit time deposits otherwise uninsured with a maturity of months or less over months through months over months through months over months total time deposits otherwise uninsured borrowed funds borrowed funds consist primarily of wholesale borrowings ie fhlbny advances repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased and to a far lesser extent junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes as of june borrowed funds declined billion or annualized to billion compared to december and represented of total assets at that date the decrease was mainly due to a decline in wholesale borrowings consisting primarily of fhlbny advances which declined to billion compared to billion at yearend also included in wholesale borrowings are repurchase agreements of million unchanged from the balance

from the offering to repurchase shares of its common stock pursuant to its previously announced share repurchase program and may use the balance of the offering towards the repurchase of its common stock or for other general corporate purposes the notes were offered to the public at of their face amount at june the balance of subordinated notes was million which excludes certain costs related to their issuance junior subordinated debentures junior subordinated debentures totaled million at june comparable to the balance at december risk definitions the following section outlines the definitions of interest rate risk market risk and liquidity risk and how the company manages market and interest rate risk interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movements in interest rates interest rate risk arises from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows repricing risk from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting company activities basis risk from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities yield curve risk and from interestrelated options embedded in a banks products options risk the evaluation of interest rate risk must consider the impact of complex illiquid hedging strategies or products and also the potential impact on fee income eg prepayment income which is sensitive to changes in interest rates in those situations where trading is separately managed this refers to structural positions and not trading portfolios market risk market risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from changes in the value of portfolios of financial instruments this risk arises from marketmaking dealing and positiontaking activities in interest rate foreign exchange equity and commodities markets many banks use the term price risk interchangeably with market risk this is because market risk focuses on the changes in market factors eg interest rates market liquidity and volatilities that affect the value of traded instruments the primary accounts affected by market risk are those which are revalued for financial presentation eg trading accounts for securities derivatives and foreign exchange products liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from a banks inability to meet its obligations when they become due without incurring unacceptable losses liquidity risk includes the inability to manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources liquidity risk also arises from a banks failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect the ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value management of market and interest rate risk we manage our assets and liabilities to reduce our exposure to changes in market interest rates the asset and liability management process has three primary objectives to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts to determine the appropriate level of risk given our business strategy risk appetite operating environment capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and to manage that risk in a manner consistent with guidelines approved by the boards of directors of the company and the bank market and interest rate risk as a financial institution we are focused on reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility changes in interest rates pose one of the greatest challenges to our financial performance as such changes can have a significant impact on the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and on the market value of all interestearning assets other than those possessing a short term to maturity to reduce our exposure to changing rates the boards of directors and management monitor interest rate sensitivity on a regular or as needed basis so that adjustments to the asset and liability mix can be made when deemed appropriate the actual duration of heldforinvestment mortgage loans and mortgagerelated securities can be significantly impacted by changes in prepayment levels and market interest rates the level of prepayments may be impacted by a variety of factors including the economy in the region where the underlying mortgages were originated seasonal factors demographic variables and the assumability of the underlying mortgages however the largest determinants of prepayments are interest rates and the availability of refinancing opportunities we manage our interest rate risk by taking the following actions continue to emphasize the origination and retention of intermediateterm assets primarily in the form of multifamily and cre loans continue to originate certain floating rate ci loans depending on funding needs replace maturing wholesale borrowings with longer term borrowings and as needed execute interest rate swaps libor transition process the discontinuation of libor has been developing since when the united kingdoms financial conduct authority fca first called for libor to be phased out by the ice benchmark administration the publisher of libor discontinued publication of the oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor on december and will discontinue publication of overnight onemonth threemonth sixmonth and twelvemonth us dollar libors on june although its use for new business was restricted after december with limited exceptions in october the international swaps and derivatives association announced fallback language for derivative contracts incorporating sofr as well as a process by which counterparties to such contracts could elect to apply the fallback language to existing derivatives on or after january sofr was identified by the alternative reference rates committee arrc a group of privatemarket participants convened to help ensure a successful transition from libor in the united states as the recommended replacement to us dollar libor in the united states the adoption of the fallback protocols does not change the index for subject agreements from libor to sofr but simply creates the legal framework for the appropriate mechanisms to occur in the future the bank established a subcommittee of alco to address issues related to the phase out and transition away from libor the subcommittee is led by our chief financial officer and consists of personnel from various departments throughout the bank the company has identified certain liborbased contracts that extend beyond june which may include loans and leases securities wholesale borrowings derivative financial instruments and longterm debt the subcommittee has reviewed the associated contracts and legal agreements for conformance to the arrc aligned fallback language and noted that certain contracts will require some form of standardization in accordance with libor transition recommended fallback provisions the frb the fdic and the occ issued supervisory guidance encouraging banks to cease entering into new contracts that use usd libor as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by december in accordance with guidance as of after december the bank does not offer libor indexed products interest rate sensitivity analysis the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a banks interest rate sensitivity gap an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time frame if it will mature or reprice within that period of time the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interestearning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time frame and the amount of interestbearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same period of time in a rising interest rate environment an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected absent the effects of other factors to experience a greater increase in the cost of its interestbearing liabilities than it would in the yield on its interestearning assets thus producing a decline in its net interest income conversely in a declining rate environment an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected to experience a lesser reduction in the yield on its interestearning assets than it would in the cost of its interestbearing liabilities thus producing an increase in its net interest income in a rising interest rate environment an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to experience a greater increase in the yield on its interestearning assets than it would in the cost of its interestbearing liabilities thus producing an increase in its net interest income conversely in a declining rate environment an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to experience a lesser reduction in the cost of its interestbearing liabilities than it would in the yield on its interestearning assets thus producing a decline in its net interest income at june our oneyear gap was a negative compared to a negative at december the change in our oneyear gap from december primarily reflects an increase in borrowings that will mature or are projected to get put back to the company and an increase in new deposit balances that are indexed to short term rates the table on the following page sets forth the amounts of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities outstanding at june which based on certain assumptions stemming from our historical experience are expected to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown except as stated below the amounts of assets and liabilities shown as repricing or maturing during a particular time period were determined in accordance with the earlier of the term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability the table provides an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at june on the basis of contractual maturities anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments within a threemonth period and subsequent selected time intervals for residential mortgagerelated securities prepayment rates are forecasted at a weighted average cpr of per annum for multifamily and cre loans prepayment rates are forecasted at weighted average cprs of and per annum respectively borrowed funds were not assumed to prepay savings interest bearing checking and money market accounts were assumed to decay based on a comprehensive statistical analysis that incorporated our historical deposit experience based on the results of this analysis savings accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of for the first five years and for years six through ten interestbearing checking accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of for the first five years and for years six through ten the decay assumptions reflect the prolonged low interest rate environment and the uncertainty regarding future depositor behavior including those accounts having specified repricing dates money market accounts were assumed to decay at a rate of for the first five years and for years six through ten at june  in millions three months or less four to twelve months more than one year to three years more than three years to five years more than five years to years more than years total interestearning assets mortgage and other loans mortgagerelated securities other securities interestearning cash cash equivalents and due from banks total interestearning assets interestbearing liabilities interestbearing checking and money market accounts savings accounts certificates of deposit borrowed funds total interestbearing liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap per period cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets cumulative net interestearning assets as a percentage of net interestbearing liabilities for the purpose of the gap analysis loans held for sale nonperforming loans and the allowances for loan losses have been excluded mortgagerelated and other securities including fhlb stock are shown at their respective carrying amounts expected amount based in part on historical experience the interest rate sensitivity gap per period represents the difference between interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities prepayment and deposit decay rates can have a significant impact on our estimated gap while we believe our assumptions to be reasonable there can be no assurance that the assumed prepayment and decay rates will approximate actual future loan and securities prepayments and deposit withdrawal activity to validate our prepayment assumptions for our multifamily and cre loan portfolios we perform a quarterly analysis during which we review our historical prepayment rates and compare them to our projected prepayment rates we continually review the actual prepayment rates to ensure that our projections are as accurate as possible since prepayments on these types of loans are not as closely correlated to changes in interest rates as prepayments on onetofour family loans tend to be in addition we review the call provisions if any in our borrowings and investment portfolios and on a monthly basis compare the actual calls to our projected calls to ensure that our projections are reasonable as of june the impact of a bp decline in market interest rates would have increased our projected prepayment rates for multifamily and cre loans by a constant prepayment rate of per annum certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding interest rate sensitivity analysis for example although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of the market while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates additionally certain assets such as adjustablerate loans have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a shortterm basis and over the life of the asset furthermore in the event of a change in interest rates prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in calculating the table also the ability of some borrowers to repay their adjustablerate loans may be adversely impacted by an increase in market interest rates interest rate sensitivity is also monitored through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in our economic value of equity eve over a range of interest rate scenarios eve is defined as the net present value of expected cash flows from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet contracts the eve ratio under any interest rate scenario is defined as the eve in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario the model assumes estimated loan prepayment rates reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates similar to those utilized in formulating the preceding interest rate sensitivity analysis based on the information and assumptions in effect at june the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in our eve assuming the changes in interest rates noted change in interest rates in basis points estimated percentage change in economic value of equity over one year over one year over one year the impact of a bp reduction in interest rates is not presented in view of the current level of the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates the net changes in eve presented in the preceding table are within the limits approved by the boards of directors of the company and the bank as with the interest rate sensitivity analysis certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the preceding interest rate risk measurements modeling changes in eve requires that certain assumptions be made which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates in this regard the eve analysis presented above assumes that the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities furthermore the model does not consider the benefit of any strategic actions we may take to further reduce our exposure to interest rate risk accordingly while the eve analysis provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and may very well differ from actual results we also utilize an internal net interest income simulation to manage our sensitivity to interest rate risk the simulation incorporates various marketbased assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on future levels of our financial assets and liabilities the assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the following table due to the frequency timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories and prepayments among other factors coupled with any actions taken to counter the effects of any such changes based on the information and assumptions in effect at june the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in future net interest income for the next twelve months assuming the changes in interest rates noted change in interest rates in basis points estimated percentage change in future net interest income over one year over one year over one year in general short and longterm rates are assumed to increase in parallel fashion across all four quarters and then remain unchanged the impact of a bp reduction in interest rates is not presented in view of the current level of the federal funds rate and other shortterm interest rates future changes in our mix of assets and liabilities may result in greater changes to our gap npv andor net interest income simulation in the event that our eve and net interest income sensitivities were to breach our internal policy limits we would undertake the following actions to ensure that appropriate remedial measures were put in place our alco committee would inform the board of directors of the variance and present recommendations to the board regarding proposed courses of action to restore conditions to withinpolicy tolerances in formulating appropriate strategies the alco committee would ascertain the primary causes of the variance from policy tolerances the expected term of such conditions and the projected effect on capital and earnings where temporary changes in market conditions or volume levels result in significant increases in risk strategies may involve reducing open positions or employing synthetic hedging techniques to more immediately reduce risk exposure where variance from policy tolerances is triggered by more fundamental imbalances in the risk profiles of core loan and deposit products a remedial strategy may involve restoring balance through natural hedges to the extent possible before employing synthetic hedging techniques other strategies might include asset restructuring involving sales of assets having higher risk profiles or a gradual restructuring of the asset mix over time to affect the maturity or repricing schedule of assets liability restructuring whereby product offerings and pricing are altered or wholesale borrowings are employed to affect the maturity structure or repricing of liabilities expansion or shrinkage of the balance sheet to correct imbalances in the repricing or maturity periods between assets and liabilities andor use or alteration of offbalance sheet positions including interest rate swaps caps floors options and forward purchase or sales commitments in connection with our net interest income simulation modeling we also evaluate the impact of changes in the slope of the yield curve at june our analysis indicated that an immediate inversion of the yield curve would be expected to result in a decrease in net interest income conversely an immediate steepening of the yield curve would be expected to result in a increase in net interest income it should be noted that the yield curve changes in these scenarios were updated given the changing market rate environment which resulted in an increase in the income sensitivity in the steepening scenario liquidity contractual obligations and offbalance sheet commitments and capital position liquidity we manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand we monitor our liquidity daily to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet our financial obligations our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents which totaled billion and billion respectively at june and december as in the past our loan and securities portfolios provided meaningful liquidity in with cash flows from the repayment and sale of loans totaling billion and cash flows from the repayment and sale of securities totaling million additional liquidity stems from deposits and from our use of wholesale funding sources including brokered deposits and wholesale borrowings in addition we have access to the banks approved lines of credit with various counterparties including the fhlbny the availability of these wholesale funding sources is generally based on the amount of mortgage loan collateral available under a blanket lien we have pledged to the respective institutions and to a lesser extent the amount of available securities that may be pledged to collateralize our borrowings at june our available borrowing capacity with the fhlbny was billion in addition the bank had availableforsale securities of billion of which billion is unpledged furthermore the bank has agreements with the frbny that enable it to access the discount window as a further means of enhancing their liquidity in connection with these agreements the bank has pledged certain loans and securities to collateralize any funds they may borrow at june the maximum amount the bank could borrow from the frbny was billion there were no borrowings against these lines of credit at june our primary investing activity is loan production and the volume of loans we originated for investment totaled billion in during this time the net cash used in investing activities totaled billion the net cash provided by our operating activities totaled million our financing activities provided net cash of billion cds due to mature or reprice in one year or less from june totaled billion representing of total cds at that date our ability to attract and retain retail deposits including cds depends on numerous factors including among others the convenience of our branches and our other banking channels our customers satisfaction with the service they receive the rates of interest we offer the types of products we feature and the attractiveness of their terms our decision to compete for deposits also depends on numerous factors including among others our access to deposits through acquisitions the availability of lowercost funding sources the impact of competition on pricing and the need to fund our loan demand the parent company is a separate legal entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity in addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases the parent company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to our stockholders as a delaware corporation the parent company is able to pay dividends either from surplus or in case there is no surplus from net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year the parent companys ability to pay dividends may also depend in part upon dividends it receives from the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends and other capital distributions to the parent company is generally limited by new york state banking law and regulations and by certain regulations of the fdic in addition the superintendent of the new york state department of financial services the superintendent the fdic and the frb for reasons of safety and soundness may prohibit the payment of dividends that are otherwise permissible by regulations under new york state banking law a new york statechartered stockform savings bank or commercial bank may declare and pay dividends out of its net profits unless there is an impairment of capital however the approval of the superintendent is required if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of a banks net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years in the bank paid dividends totaling million to the parent company leaving million that it could dividend to the parent company without regulatory approval at yearend additional sources of liquidity available to the parent company at june included million in cash and cash equivalents if the bank was to apply to the superintendent for approval to make a dividend or capital distribution in excess of the dividend amounts permitted under the regulations there can be no assurance that such application would be approved contractual obligations and offbalance sheet commitments in the normal course of business we enter into a variety of contractual obligations in order to manage our assets and liabilities fund loan growth operate our branch network and address our capital needs for example we offer cds with contractual terms to our customers and borrow funds under contract from the fhlbny and various brokerage firms these contractual obligations are reflected in the consolidated statements of condition under deposits and borrowed funds respectively at june we had cds of billion and longterm debt defined as borrowed funds with an original maturity one year or more of billion at june we also had commitments to extend credit in the form of mortgage and other loan originations as well as commercial performance standby and financial standby letters of credit totaling billion these offbalance sheet commitments consist of agreements to extend credit as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract under which the loan is made commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require the payment of a fee the letters of credit we issue consist of performance standby financial standby and commercial letters of credit financial standby letters of credit primarily are issued for the benefit of other financial institutions municipalities or landlords on behalf of certain of our current borrowers and obligate us to guarantee payment of a specified financial obligation performance standby letters of credit are primarily issued for the benefit of local municipalities on behalf of certain of our borrowers performance letters of credit obligate us to make payments in the event that a specified third party fails to perform under nonfinancial contractual obligations commercial letters of credit act as a means of ensuring payment to a seller upon shipment of goods to a buyer although commercial letters of credit are used to effect payment for domestic transactions the majority are used to settle payments in international trade typically such letters of credit require the presentation of documents that describe the commercial transaction and provide evidence of shipment and the transfer of title the fees we collect in connection with the issuance of letters of credit are included in fee income in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income based upon our current liquidity position we expect that our funding will be sufficient to fulfill these cash obligations and commitments when they are due both in the short term and long term for the three months ended june we did not engage in any offbalance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows at june we had no commitments to purchase securities capital position on march we issued  of preferred stock the offering generated capital of million net of underwriting and other issuance costs for general corporate purposes with the bulk of the proceeds being distributed to the bank on october the company announced that it had received regulatory approval to repurchase its common stock accordingly the board of directors approved a million common share repurchase program the repurchase program was funded through the issuance of a like amount of subordinated notes as of june the company has repurchased a total of million shares at an average price of or an aggregate purchase price of million leaving million remaining under the current authorization stockholders equity common stockholders equity and tangible common stockholders equity includes aocl which decreased million from the balance at the end of last year and million from the yearago quarter to million at june the yeartodate decrease was primarily the result of a million change in the net unrealized gain loss on availableforsale securities net of tax and a million change in the net unrealized loss on cash flow hedges net of tax to million regulatory capital the bank is subject to regulation examination and supervision by the nysdfs and the fdic the regulators the bank is also governed by numerous federal and state laws and regulations including the fdic improvement act of which established five categories of capital adequacy ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized such classifications are used by the fdic to determine various matters including prompt corrective action and each institutions fdic deposit insurance premium assessments capital amounts and classifications are also subject to the regulators qualitative judgments about the components of capital and risk weightings among other factors the quantitative measures established to ensure capital adequacy require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of leverage capital to average assets and of common equity tier capital tier capital and total capital to riskweighted assets as such measures are defined in the regulations at june our capital measures continued to exceed the minimum federal requirements for a bank holding company and for a bank the following table sets forth our common equity tier tier riskbased total riskbased and leverage capital amounts and ratios on a consolidated basis and for the bank on a standalone basis as well

million net of income tax and a million revaluation of the companys deferred taxes due to a change in the new york state tax rate net interest income net interest income is our primary source of income its level is a function of the average balance of our interestearning assets the average balance of our interestbearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities these factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interestearning assets and our interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by various external factors including the local economy competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the fomc and market interest rates net interest income is also influenced by the level of prepayment income primarily generated in connection with the prepayment of our multifamily and cre loans as well as securities since prepayment income is recorded as interest income an increase or decrease in its level will also be reflected in the average yields as applicable on our loans securities and interestearning assets and therefore in our interest rate spread and net interest margin it should be noted that the level of prepayment income on loans recorded in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay during that time such activity is largely dependent on such external factors as current market conditions including real estate values and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates in addition while a decline in market interest rates may trigger an increase in refinancing and therefore prepayment income so too may an increase in market interest rates it is not unusual for borrowers to lock in lower interest rates when they expect or see that market interest rates are rising rather than risk refinancing later at a still higher interest rate yearoveryear comparison net interest income for the three months ended june totaled million up million or on a yearoveryear basis this was driven by a million or increase in interest income offset by a million or increase in interest expense details of the change in net interest income are as follows interest income on loans and leases rose million or to million on a yearoveryear basis and interest income on interestearning cash and cash equivalents rose million to million while interest income on securities declined million to million the yearoveryear improvement in interest income was due to a billion or increase in average assets to billion mainly due to a significant increase in average loan balances along with a seven basispoint improvement in the average yield to average loans increased billion to billion on a yearoveryear basis while the average loan yield increased one basis point to average securities balances of billion were relatively unchanged however the average securities yield declined basis points yearoveryear to interest expense on average interestbearing
