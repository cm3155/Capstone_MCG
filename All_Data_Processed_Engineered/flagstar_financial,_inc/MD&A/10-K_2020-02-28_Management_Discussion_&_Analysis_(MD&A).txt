item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations table end for the purpose of this discussion and analysis the words we us our and the company are used to refer to new york community bancorp inc and our consolidated subsidiaries including new york community bank the bank executive summary new york community bancorp inc is the holding company for new york community bank with branches in metro new york new jersey ohio florida and arizona at december we had total assets of billion including total loans of billion total deposits of billion and total stockholders equity of billion chartered in the state of new york the bank is subject to regulation by the fdic the cfpb and the nysdfs in addition the holding company is subject to regulation by the frb the sec and to the requirements of the nyse where shares of our common stock are traded under the symbol nycb and shares of our preferred stock trade under the symbol nycb pa as a publicly traded company our mission is to provide our shareholders with a solid return on their investment by producing a strong financial performance maintaining a solid capital position and engaging in corporate strategies that enhance the value of their shares for the twelve months ended december the company reported net income of million compared to the million reported for the twelve months ended december net income available to common shareholders in the comparable period was million versus million for the twelve months ended december diluted earnings per common share were for the twelve months ended december as compared to per diluted common share for the twelve months ended december the key trends during were continued growth in our loan portfolio at december the companys loan portfolio totaled billion up billion or a increase compared to the balance at december the yearoveryear growth in our loan portfolio was due to growth in the multifamily portfolio the specialty finance portfolio which is part of our ci loan portfolio and the cre portfolio fueled by billion in originations and million of repurchases the multifamily portfolio increased billion or to billion at december compared to billion at december and it accounted for most of the loan growth during the current year the specialty finance portfolio had another strong year growing million or on a yearoveryear basis to billion at december while the cre portfolio increased million or to billion at december compared to december inflection point for the nim and net interest income both net interest income and the nim declined on a yearoveryear basis but they increased during the fourth quarter of marking the first time since the end of that both of these metrics increased the primary driver of the increase was lower funding costs which led to lower interest expense which in turn drove the growth in net interest income the nim rose five basis points to on a linkedquarter basis as net interest income improved million to million or annualized compared to the third quarter of operating expenses decline further our costcutting efforts continued to pay off in after declining nearly million during the course of total noninterest expense declined a further million or over the course of in noninterest expense included million of certain items related to severance costs and branch rationalization costs asset quality remained exceptional during the current year the companys asset quality metrics remained strong during fullyear total npas were million or of total assets while nonperforming loans were million or of total loans included in these amounts was million of nonaccrual taxi medallionrelated loans repossessed assets were million at yearend and included million of repossessed taxi medallions at that time period for the twelve months ended december we recorded million of net chargeoffs or of average loans this figure included million of chargeoffs related to the taxi medallion portfolio importantly on a combined basis we only recorded of chargeoffs in the mfcre loan portfolios or of average loans external factors the following is a discussion of certain external factors that tend to influence our financial performance and the strategic actions we take interest rates among the external factors that tend to influence our performance the interest rate environment is key just as shortterm interest rates affect the cost of our deposits and that of the funds we borrow market interest rates affect the yields on the loans we produce for investment and the securities in which we invest as further discussed under loans held for investment later on in this discussion the interest rates on our multifamily loans and cre credits generally are based on the fiveyear and sevenyear cmt the following table summarizes the high low and average five and sevenyear cmt rates in and table start constant maturity treasury rates fiveyear sevenyear high low average table end because the multifamily and cre loans we produce generate income when they prepay which is recorded as interest income the impact of repayment activity can be especially meaningful in prepayment income from loans contributed million to interest income in the prior year the contribution was million economic indicators while we attribute our asset quality to the nature of the loans we produce and our conservative underwriting standards the quality of our assets can also be impacted by economic conditions in our local markets and throughout the united states the information that follows consists of recent economic data that we consider to be germane to our performance and the markets we serve the following table presents the generally downward trend in unemployment rates as reported by the us

quarterly cash dividend on the companys common stock of per share payable on february to common shareholders of record at the close of business on february critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies to be critically important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations since they require management to make complex or subjective judgments some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain the inherent sensitivity of our consolidated financial statements to these critical accounting policies and the judgments estimates and assumptions used therein could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations we have identified the following to be critical accounting policies the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the determination of the amount if any of goodwill impairment the judgments used by management in applying these critical accounting policies may be influenced by adverse changes in the economic environment which may result in changes to future financial results allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable and estimable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the date of the balance sheet losses on loans are charged against and recoveries of losses on loans are credited back to the allowance for loan losses the methodology used for the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at december and december was generally comparable whereby the bank segregated their loss factors used for both criticized and noncriticized loans into a component that was primarily based on historical loss rates and a component that was primarily based on other qualitative factors that are probable to affect loan collectability in determining the allowance for loan losses management considers the banks current business strategies and credit processes including compliance with applicable regulatory guidelines and with guidelines approved by the boards of directors with regard to credit limitations loan approvals underwriting criteria and loan workout procedures the allowance for loan losses is established based on managements evaluation of incurred losses in the portfolio in accordance with gaap and is comprised of both specific valuation allowances and a general valuation allowance specific valuation allowances are established based on managements analyses of individual loans that are considered impaired if a loan is deemed to be impaired management measures the extent of the impairment and establishes a specific valuation allowance for that amount a loan is classified as impaired when based on current information andor events it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement we apply this classification as necessary to loans individually evaluated for impairment in our portfolios smallerbalance homogenous loans and loans carried at the lower of cost or fair value are evaluated for impairment on a collective rather than individual basis loans to certain borrowers who have experienced financial difficulty and for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession are considered tdrs and are classified as impaired we primarily measure impairment on an individual loan and determine the extent to which a specific valuation allowance is necessary by comparing the loans outstanding balance to either the fair value of the collateral less the estimated cost to sell or the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate generally when the fair value of the collateral net of the estimated cost to sell or the present value of the expected cash flows is less than the recorded investment in the loan any shortfall is promptly charged off we also follow a process to assign the general valuation allowance to loan categories the general valuation allowance is established by applying our loan loss provisioning methodology and reflect the inherent risk in outstanding heldforinvestment loans this loan loss provisioning methodology considers various factors in determining the appropriate quantified risk factors to use to determine the general valuation allowance the factors assessed begin with the historical loan loss experience for each major loan category we also take into account an estimated historical loss emergence period which is the period of time between the event that triggers a loss and the confirmation andor chargeoff of that loss for each loan portfolio segment the allocation methodology consists of the following components first we determine an allowance for loan losses based on a quantitative loss factor for loans evaluated collectively for impairment this quantitative loss factor is based primarily on historical loss rates after considering loan type historical loss and delinquency experience and loss emergence periods the quantitative loss factors applied in the methodology are periodically reevaluated and adjusted to reflect changes in historical loss levels loss emergence periods or other risks lastly we allocate an allowance for loan losses based on qualitative loss factors these qualitative loss factors are designed to account for losses that may not be provided for by the quantitative loss component due to other factors evaluated by management which include but are not limited to table start changes in lending policies and procedures including changes in underwriting standards and collection and chargeoff and recovery practices table end table start changes in international national regional and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the

external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the existing portfolio table end by considering the factors discussed above we determine an allowance for loan losses that is applied to each significant loan portfolio segment to determine the total allowance for loan losses the historical loss period we use to determine the allowance for loan losses on loans is a rolling 36quarter lookback period as we believe this produces an appropriate reflection of our historical loss experience the process of establishing the allowance for losses on loans also involves table start periodic inspections of the loan collateral by qualified inhouse and external property appraisersinspectors table end table start regular meetings of executive management with the pertinent board committees during which observable trends in the local economy andor the real estate market are discussed table end table start assessment of the aforementioned factors by the pertinent members of the board of directors and management when making a business judgment regarding the impact of anticipated changes on the future level of loan losses and table end table start analysis of the portfolio in the aggregate as well as on an individual loan basis taking into consideration payment history underwriting analyses and internal risk ratings table end in order to determine their overall adequacy the loan loss allowance is reviewed quarterly by management board committees and the board of directors of the bank as applicable we charge off loans or portions of loans in the period that such loans or portions thereof are deemed uncollectible the collectability of individual loans is determined through an assessment of the financial condition and repayment capacity of the borrower andor through an estimate of the fair value of any underlying collateral for nonreal estaterelated consumer credits the following pastdue time periods determine when chargeoffs are typically recorded closedend credits are charged off in the quarter that the loan becomes days past due openend credits are charged off in the quarter that the loan becomes days past due and both closedend and openend credits are typically charged off in the quarter that the credit is days past the date we received notification that the borrower has filed for bankruptcy the level of future additions to the respective loan loss allowance is based on many factors including certain factors that are beyond managements control such as changes in economic and local market conditions including declines in real estate values and increases in vacancy rates and unemployment management uses the best available information to recognize losses on loans or to make additions to the loan loss allowance however the bank may be required to take certain chargeoffs andor recognize further additions to the loan loss allowance based on the judgment of regulatory agencies with regard to information provided during their examinations of the bank an allowance for unfunded commitments is maintained separate from the allowance for loan losses and is included in other liabilities in the consolidated statements of condition see note allowance for loan losses for a further discussion of our allowance for loan losses goodwill impairment we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill as of december we had goodwill of billion in connection with our acquisitions assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired including other identified intangible assets our goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually as of yearend or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired we test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level these impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we have identified one reporting unit which is the same as our operating segment and reportable segment if we change our strategy or if market conditions shift our judgments may change which may result in adjustments to the recorded goodwill balance for annual goodwill impairment testing we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill and other intangible assets if we conclude that this is the case we must perform the twostep test described below if we conclude based on the qualitative assessment that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we have completed our goodwill impairment test and do not need to perform the twostep test step one requires the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value in order to identify potential impairment if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of its net assets goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required if the carrying value of the net assets exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit potential impairment is indicated at the reporting unit level and step two of the impairment test is performed step two requires that when potential impairment is indicated in step one we compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires a valuation of the reporting units tangible and nongoodwill intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of the purchase price in a business combination any excess in the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is referred to as the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess during the year ended december no triggering events were identified that indicated that the value of goodwill may be impaired for the year ended december the companys annual goodwill impairment assessment using step one of the quantitative test found no indication of goodwill impairment income taxes in estimating income taxes management assesses the relative merits and risks of the tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position in this process management also relies on tax opinions recent audits and historical experience although we use the best available information to record income taxes underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances such as changes in tax laws and judicial guidance influencing our overall or transactionspecific tax position we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the carryforward of certain tax attributes such as net operating losses a valuation allowance is maintained for deferred tax assets that we estimate are more likely than not to be unrealizable based on available evidence at the time the estimate is made in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we estimate future taxable income considering the prudence and feasibility of tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets in the future we would reduce such amounts through a charge to income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made conversely if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease in income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made subsequently recognized tax benefits associated with valuation allowances recorded in a business combination would be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill financial condition balance sheet summary at december total assets were billion up billion or on a yearoveryear basis our asset growth was largely the result of loan growth and to a much lesser extent growth in the securities portfolio this was funded through a combination of growth in deposits and in wholesale borrowings and by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents total loans held for investment rose billion or on a yearoveryear basis to billion as the multifamily loan portfolio increased billion or to billion and the ci loan portfolio rose million or to billion total securities consisting mainly of availableforsale securities increased million or on a yearoveryear basis to billion on the liability side total deposits rose million or to billion compared to the balance at yearend while total borrowed funds increased million or to billion most of the growth in borrowings occurred in the fourth quarter of the year total stockholders equity at december was billion relatively unchanged compared to the balance at december common stockholders equity to total assets was compared to at december book value per common share was at december compared to at december excluding goodwill of billion at both december and tangible common stockholders equity totaled billion at yearend up million or compared to yearend tangible common stockholders equity to tangible assets was at december compared to at december tangible book value per common share at december was compared to at december loans loans held for investment the majority of the loans we produce are multifamily loans our production of multifamily loans began several decades ago in the five boroughs of new york city where the majority of the rental units currently consist of rentregulated apartments featuring belowmarket rents in addition to multifamily loans our loan portfolio contains a large number of cre credits most of which are secured by incomeproducing properties located in new york city and on long island in addition to multifamily loans and cre loans our portfolio includes substantially smaller balances of onetofour family loans adc loans and other loans held for investment with ci loans comprising the bulk of the other loan portfolio specialty finance loans and leases account for most of our ci credits with the remainder consisting primarily of loans to small and midsize businesses referred to as other ci loans in we originated billion of loans a million or a increase from the prior year the higher level of originations was largely driven by an increase in specialty finance originations and cre originations offset by a decline in multifamily originations during fullyear the bank originated billion of multifamily loans down compared to fullyear while specialty finance loans grew million or to billion and cre originations increased million or in addition to the strong origination volumes over the course of during the fourth quarter of the year the company also opportunistically repurchased million of primarily multifamily loans it previously originated and sold to other financial institutions these loans were originally sold by the company in order to manage the balance sheet below the billion in asset sifi threshold in place at the time multifamily loans multifamily loans are our principal asset the loans we produce are primarily secured by nonluxury residential apartment buildings in new york city that feature rentregulated units and belowmarket rentsa market we refer to as our primary lending niche consistent with our emphasis on multifamily lending multifamily loan originations represented billion or of the loans we produced for investment in at december multifamily loans represented billion or of total loans held for investment reflecting a yearoveryear increase of billion or and the average multifamily loan had a principal balance of million and million the expected weighted average life of the portfolio was years at december compared to years at december the majority of our multifamily loans were secured by rental apartment buildings in addition of our multifamily loans were secured by buildings in the metro new york city area and were secured by buildings elsewhere in new york state the remaining multifamily loans were secured by buildings outside these markets including in the four other states served by our retail branch offices at december billion or of the companys total multifamily loan portfolio is secured by properties in new york state and therefore are subject to the new rent regulation laws the weighted average ltv of the nys rent regulated multifamily portfolio was as of december compared to a weighted average ltv of for the entire multifamily loan portfolio at that date in addition to underwriting multifamily loans on the basis of the buildings income and condition we consider the borrowers credit history profitability and building management expertise borrowers are required to present evidence of their ability to repay the loan from the buildings current rent rolls their financial statements and related documents while a percentage of our multifamily loans are tenyear fixed rate credits the vast majority of our multifamily loans feature a term of ten or twelve years with a fixed rate of interest for the first five or seven years of the loan and an alternative rate of interest in years six through ten or eight through twelve the rate charged in the first five or seven years is generally based on intermediateterm interest rates plus a spread during the remaining years the loan resets to an annually adjustable rate that is tied to the prime rate of interest plus a spread alternately the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that is tied to the fiveyear fixed advance rate of the fhlbny plus a spread the fixedrate option also requires the payment of one percentage point of the thenoutstanding loan balance in either case the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial fiveor sevenyear term as the rent roll increases the typical property owner seeks to refinance the mortgage and generally does so before the loan reprices in year six or eight multifamily loans that refinance within the first five or seven years are typically subject to an established prepayment penalty schedule depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the thencurrent loan balance if a loan extends past the fifth or seventh year and the borrower selects the fixedrate option the prepayment penalties typically reset to a range of five points to one point over years six through ten or eight through twelve for example a tenyear multifamily loan that prepays in year three would generally be expected to pay a prepayment penalty equal to three percentage points of the remaining principal balance a twelveyear multifamily loan that prepays in year one or two would generally be expected to pay a penalty equal to five percentage points because prepayment penalties are recorded as interest income they are reflected in the average yields on our loans and interestearning assets our net interest rate spread and net interest margin and the level of net interest income we record no assumptions are involved in the recognition of prepayment income as such income is only recorded when cash is received our success as a multifamily lender partly reflects the solid relationships we have developed with the markets leading mortgage brokers who are familiar with our lending practices our underwriting standards and our longstanding practice of basing our loans on the cash flows produced by the properties the process of producing such loans is generally four to six weeks in duration and because the multifamily market is largely brokerdriven the expense incurred in sourcing such loans is substantially reduced our emphasis on multifamily loans is driven by several factors including their structure which reduces our exposure to interest rate volatility to some degree another factor driving our focus on multifamily lending has been the comparative quality of the loans we produce reflecting the nature of the buildings securing our loans our underwriting standards and the generally conservative ltv ratios our multifamily loans feature at origination a relatively small percentage of the multifamily loans that have transitioned to nonperforming status have actually resulted in losses even when the credit cycle has taken a downward turn we primarily underwrite our multifamily loans based on the current cash flows produced by the collateral property with a reliance on the income approach to appraising the properties rather than the sales approach the sales approach is subject to fluctuations in the real estate market as well as general economic conditions and is therefore likely to be more risky in the event of a downward credit cycle turn we also consider a variety of other factors including the physical condition of the underlying property the net operating income of the mortgaged premises prior to debt service the dscr which is the ratio of the propertys net operating income to its debt service and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value ie the ltv of the property in addition to requiring a minimum dscr of on multifamily buildings we obtain a security interest in the personal property located on the premises and an assignment of rents and leases our multifamily loans generally represent no more than of the lower of the appraised value or the sales price of the underlying property and typically feature an amortization period of years in addition our multifamily loans may contain an initial interestonly period which typically does not exceed two years however these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis accordingly while our multifamily lending niche has not been immune to downturns in the credit cycle the limited number of losses we have recorded even in adverse credit cycles suggests that the multifamily loans we produce involve less credit risk than certain other types of loans in general buildings that are subject to rent regulation have tended to be stable with occupancy levels remaining more or less constant over time because the rents are typically below market and the buildings securing our loans are generally maintained in good condition they have been more likely to retain their tenants in adverse economic times in addition we exclude any shortterm property tax exemptions and abatement benefits the property owners receive when we underwrite our multifamily loans commercial real estate loans at december cre loans represented billion or of total loans held for investment reflecting a yearoveryear increase of million or compared to december the average cre loan had a principal balance of million at the end of this december as compared to million at the prior yearend in addition the portfolio had an expected weighted average life of years and years at the corresponding dates cre loans represented billion or of the loans we originated in as compared to million or in the prior year the cre loans we produce are secured by incomeproducing properties such as office buildings retail centers mixeduse buildings and multitenanted light industrial properties at december of our cre loans were secured by properties in the metro new york city area while properties in other parts of new york state accounted for of the properties securing our cre credits while all other states accounted for combined the terms of our cre loans are similar to the terms of our multifamily credits while a small percentage of our cre loans feature tenyear fixedrate terms they primarily feature a fixed rate of interest for the first five or seven years of the loan that is generally based on intermediateterm interest rates plus a spread during years six through ten or eight through twelve the loan resets to an annually adjustable rate that is tied to the prime rate of interest plus a spread alternately the borrower may opt for a fixed rate that is tied to the fiveyear fixed advance rate of the fhlbny plus a spread the fixedrate option also requires the payment of an amount equal to one percentage point of the thenoutstanding loan balance in either case the minimum rate at repricing is equivalent to the rate in the initial five or sevenyear term prepayment penalties apply to our cre loans as they do our multifamily credits depending on the remaining term of the loan at the time of prepayment the penalties normally range from five percentage points to one percentage point of the thencurrent loan balance if a loan extends past the fifth or seventh year and the borrower selects the fixed rate option the prepayment penalties typically reset to a range of five points to one point over years six through ten or eight through twelve our cre loans tend to refinance within two to three years of origination as reflected in the expected weighted average life of the cre portfolio noted above the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties to minimize our credit risk we originate cre loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the propertys current income stream and dscr the approval of a loan also depends on the borrowers credit history profitability and expertise in property management and generally requires a minimum dscr of and a maximum ltv of in addition the origination of cre loans typically requires a security interest in the fixtures equipment and other personal property of the borrower andor an assignment of the rents andor leases in addition our cre loans may contain an interestonly period which typically does not exceed three years however these loans are underwritten on a fully amortizing basis ci loans our ci loans are divided into two categories specialty finance loans and leases and other ci loans as further described below specialty finance loans and leases at december and specialty finance loans and leases represented billion and billion respectively of total loans held for investment we produce our specialty finance loans and leases through a subsidiary that is staffed by a group of industry veterans with expertise in originating and underwriting senior securitized debt and equipment loans and leases the subsidiary participates in syndicated loans that are brought to them and equipment loans and leases that are assigned to them by a select group of nationally recognized sources and are generally made to large corporate obligors many of which are publicly traded carry investment grade or nearinvestment grade ratings and participate in stable industries nationwide the specialty finance loans and leases we fund fall into three categories assetbased lending dealer floorplan lending and equipment loan and lease financing each of these credits is secured with a perfected first security interest in or outright ownership of the underlying collateral and structured as senior debt or as a noncancelable lease assetbased and dealer floorplan loans are priced at floating rates predominately tied to libor while our equipment financing credits are priced at fixed rates at a spread over treasuries since launching our specialty finance business in the third quarter of no losses have been recorded on any of the loans or leases in this portfolio other ci loans in the twelve months ended december other ci loans declined million to million and represented million of the heldforinvestment loans we produced included in the balance at yearend were taxi medallionrelated loans of million in contrast to the loans produced by our specialty finance subsidiary the other ci loans we produce are primarily made to small and midsize businesses in the five boroughs of new york city and on long island such loans are tailored to meet the specific needs of our borrowers and include term loans demand loans revolving lines of credit and to a much lesser extent loans that are partly guaranteed by the small business administration a broad range of other ci loans both collateralized and unsecured are made available to businesses for working capital including inventory and accounts receivable business expansion the purchase of machinery and equipment and other general corporate needs in determining the term and structure of other ci loans several factors are considered including the purpose the collateral and the anticipated sources of repayment other ci loans are typically secured by business assets and personal guarantees of the borrower and include financial covenants to monitor the borrowers financial stability the interest rates on our other ci loans can be fixed or floating with floatingrate loans being tied to prime or some other market index plus an applicable spread our floatingrate loans may or may not feature a floor rate of interest the decision to require a floor on other ci loans depends on the level of competition we face for such loans from other institutions the direction of market interest rates and the profitability of our relationship with the borrower acquisition development and construction loans at december adc loans represented million or of total loans held for investment as compared to million or at the prior yearend originations of adc loans totaled million in up million from the yearearlier amount at december of the loans in our adc portfolio were for land acquisition and development the remaining consisted of loans that were provided for the construction of commercial properties and owneroccupied homes loan terms vary based upon the scope of the construction and generally range from months to two years they also feature a floating rate of interest tied to prime with a floor at december of our adc loans were for properties in new york city because adc loans are generally considered to have a higher degree of credit risk especially during a downturn in the credit cycle borrowers are required to provide a guarantee of repayment and completion in the twelve months ended december and we did not recover any losses against guarantees the risk of loss on an adc loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial appraisal of the propertys value upon completion of construction the developers experience the estimated cost of construction including interest and the estimated time to complete andor sell or lease such property when applicable as a condition to closing an adc loan it is our practice to require that properties meet presale or prelease requirements prior to funding onetofour family loans at december onetofour family loans represented million or of total loans held for investment as compared to million or at the prior yearend these loan balances include certain mixeduse cre loans with less than five residential units being classified as onetofour family loans other than these types of loans we do not currently expect to originate traditional onetofour family loans other loans at december other loans totaled million and consisted primarily of consumer loans most of which were overdraft loans and loans to nonprofit organizations we currently do not offer home equity loans or lines of credit

management credit committee the commercial credit committee and the mortgage and real estate and credit committees of the board and the board of directors of the bank all multifamily cre adc and specialty finance loans regardless of amount and ci loans in excess of million are required to be presented to the management credit committee for approval multifamily cre and ci loans in excess of

continue to be reported to the board of directors the various committee have authority to direct changes in lending practices as they deem necessary or appropriate in order to address individual or aggregate risks and credit exposures in accordance with the banks strategic objectives and risk appetites in loans greater than million were originated by the bank with an aggregate loan balance of

table sets forth the changes in nonperforming loans over the twelve months ended december table start in thousands balance at december new nonaccrual chargeoffs transferred to repossessed assets loan payoffs including dispositions and principal paydowns restored to performing status balance at december table end a loan generally is classified as a nonaccrual loan when it is days or more past due or when it is deemed to be impaired because we no longer expect to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status we cease the accrual of interest owed and previously accrued interest is reversed and charged against interest income at december and all of our nonperforming loans were nonaccrual loans a loan is generally returned to accrual status when the loan is current and we have reasonable assurance that the loan will be fully collectible we monitor nonaccrual loans both within and beyond our primary lending area in the same manner monitoring loans generally involves inspecting and reappraising the collateral properties holding discussions with the principals and managing agents of the borrowing entities andor retained legal counsel as applicable requesting financial operating and rent roll information confirming that hazard insurance is in place or forceplacing such insurance monitoring tax payment status and advancing funds as needed and appointing a receiver whenever possible to collect rents manage the operations provide information and maintain the collateral properties it is our policy to order updated appraisals for all nonperforming loans irrespective of loan type that are collateralized by multifamily buildings cre properties or land in the event that such a loan is days or more past due and if the most recent appraisal on file for the property is more than one year old appraisals are ordered annually until such time as the loan becomes performing and is returned to accrual status it is not our policy to obtain updated appraisals for performing loans however appraisals may be ordered for performing loans when a borrower requests an increase in the loan amount a modification in loan terms or an extension of a maturing loan we do not analyze current ltvs on a portfoliowide basis nonperforming loans are reviewed regularly by management and discussed on a monthly basis with the mortgage committee the credit committee and the board of directors of the bank as applicable in accordance with our chargeoff policy collateraldependent nonperforming loans are written down to their current appraised values less certain transaction costs workout specialists from our loan workout unit actively pursue borrowers who are delinquent in repaying their loans in an effort to collect payment in addition outside counsel with experience in foreclosure proceedings are retained to institute such action with regard to such borrowers properties and other assets that are acquired through foreclosure are classified as repossessed assets and are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition less the estimated cost of selling the property subsequent declines in the fair value of the assets are charged to earnings and are included in noninterest expense it is our policy to require an appraisal and an environmental assessment of properties classified as oreo before foreclosure and to reappraise the properties on an asneeded basis and not less than annually until they are sold we dispose of such properties as quickly and prudently as possible given current market conditions and the propertys condition to mitigate the potential for credit losses we underwrite our loans in accordance with credit standards that we consider to be prudent in the case of multifamily and cre loans we look first at the consistency of the cash flows being generated by the property to determine its economic value using the income approach and then at the market value of the property that collateralizes the loan the amount of the loan is then based on the lower of the two values with the economic value more typically used the condition of the collateral property is another critical factor multifamily buildings and cre properties are inspected from rooftop to basement as a prerequisite to approval with a member of the mortgage or credit committee participating in inspections on multifamily loans to be originated in excess of million and a member of the mortgage or credit committee participating in inspections on cre loans to be originated in excess of million furthermore independent appraisers whose appraisals are carefully reviewed by our experienced inhouse appraisal officers and staff perform appraisals on collateral properties in many cases a second independent appraisal review is performed in addition we work with a select group of mortgage brokers who are familiar with our credit standards and whose track record with our lending officers is typically greater than ten years furthermore in new york city where the majority of the buildings securing our multifamily loans are located the rents that tenants may be charged on certain apartments are typically restricted under certain rentcontrol or rentstabilization laws as a result the rents that tenants pay for such apartments are generally lower than current market rents buildings with a preponderance of such rentregulated apartments are less likely to experience vacancies in times of economic adversity reflecting the strength of the underlying collateral for these loans and the collateral structure a relatively small percentage of our nonperforming multifamily loans have resulted in losses over time to further manage our credit risk our lending policies limit the amount of credit granted to any one borrower and typically require minimum dscrs of for multifamily loans and for cre loans although we typically lend up to of the appraised value on multifamily buildings and up to on commercial properties the average ltvs of such credits at origination were below those amounts at december exceptions to these ltv limitations are minimal and are reviewed on a casebycase basis the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate is often dependent on the successful operation and management of the underlying properties to minimize our credit risk we originate cre loans in adherence with conservative underwriting standards and require that such loans qualify on the basis of the propertys current income stream and dscr the approval of a cre loan also depends on the borrowers credit history profitability and expertise in property management given that our cre loans are underwritten in accordance with underwriting standards that are similar to those applicable to our multifamily credits the percentage of our nonperforming cre loans that have resulted in losses has been comparatively small over time multifamily and cre loans are generally originated at conservative ltvs and dscrs as previously stated low ltvs provide a greater likelihood of full recovery and reduce the possibility of incurring a severe loss on a credit in many cases they reduce the likelihood of the borrower walking away from the property although borrowers may default on loan payments they have a greater incentive to protect their equity in the collateral property and to return their loans to performing status furthermore in the case of multifamily loans the cash flows generated by the properties are generally belowmarket and have significant value with regard to adc loans we typically lend up to of the estimated ascompleted market value of multifamily and residential tract projects however in the case of home construction loans to individuals the limit is with respect to commercial construction loans we typically lend up to of the estimated ascompleted market value of the property credit risk is also managed through the loan disbursement process loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and as warranted by inspection reports provided to us by our own lending officers andor consulting engineers to minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing each of our credits is secured with a perfected first security interest or outright ownership in the underlying collateral and structured as senior debt or as a noncancellable lease to further minimize the risk involved in specialty finance lending and leasing we reunderwrite each transaction in addition we retain outside counsel to conduct a further review of the underlying documentation other ci loans are typically underwritten on the basis of the cash flows produced by the borrowers business and are generally collateralized by various business assets including but not limited to inventory equipment and accounts receivable as a result the capacity of the borrower to repay is substantially dependent on the degree to which the business is successful furthermore the collateral underlying the loan may depreciate over time may not be conducive to appraisal and may fluctuate in value based upon the operating results of the business accordingly personal guarantees are also a normal requirement for other ci loans in addition at december onetofour family loans adc loans and other loans represented and of total loans held for investment as compared to and respectively at december furthermore while of our other loans were nonperforming at december of our onetofour family loans were nonperforming at that date there were no nonperforming adc loans at december the procedures we follow with respect to delinquent loans are generally consistent across all categories with late charges assessed and notices mailed to the borrower at specified dates we attempt to reach the borrower by telephone to ascertain the reasons for delinquency and the prospects for repayment when contact is made with a borrower at any time prior to foreclosure or recovery against collateral property we attempt to obtain full payment and will consider a repayment schedule to avoid taking such action delinquencies are addressed by our loan workout unit and every effort is made to collect rather than initiate foreclosure proceedings the following table presents our noncovered loans to days past due by loan type and the changes in the respective balances from december to december table start change from december to december  in thousands december december amount percent loans days past due multifamily nm commercial real estate nm onetofour family nm acquisition development and construction other loans total loans days past due table end table start includes and of nonaccrual taxi medallionrelated loans at december and respectively table end fair values for all multifamily buildings cre properties and land are determined based on the appraised value if an appraisal is more than one year old and the loan is classified as either nonperforming or as an accruing tdr then an updated appraisal is required to determine fair value estimated disposition costs are deducted from the fair value of the property to determine estimated net realizable value in the instance of an outdated appraisal on an impaired loan we adjust the original appraisal by using a thirdparty index value to determine the extent of impairment until an updated appraisal is received while we strive to originate loans that will perform fully adverse economic and market conditions among other factors can negatively impact a borrowers ability to repay historically our level of chargeoffs has been relatively low in downward credit cycles even when the volume of nonperforming loans has increased in we recorded net chargeoffs of million as compared to net chargeoffs of million in the prior year taxi medallionrelated net chargeoffs accounted for million of this years amount and million of last years amount partially reflecting the net chargeoffs noted above and the provision of million for the allowance for loan losses the allowance for losses on loans decreased million equaling million at the end of this december from million at december reflecting the decrease in nonperforming loans cited earlier in this discussion the allowance for losses on loans represented of nonperforming loans at december as compared to at the prior yearend based upon all relevant and available information at the end of this december management believes that the allowance for losses on loans was appropriate at that

end troubled debt restructurings in an effort to proactively manage delinquent loans we have selectively extended such concessions as rate reductions and extensions of maturity dates as well as forbearance agreements to certain borrowers who have experienced financial difficulty in accordance with gaap we are required to account for such loan modifications or restructurings as tdrs the eligibility of a borrower for workout concessions of any nature depends upon the facts and circumstances of each transaction which may change from period to period and involve managements judgment regarding the likelihood that the concession will result in the maximum recovery for the company loans modified as tdrs are placed on nonaccrual status until we determine that future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured this generally requires that the borrower demonstrate performance according to the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months at december loans modified as tdrs totaled million including accruing loans of million and nonaccrual loans of million at the prior yearend loans modified as tdrs totaled million including accruing loans of million and

were reached amounted to million and at the respective dates multifamily and cre loans accounted for million and zero dollars of tdrs at the end of this december as compared to million and zero respectively at the prior yearend based on the number of loans performing in accordance with their revised terms our success rate for restructured multifamily loans was for adc loans it was and for onetofour loans it was at the end of this december our success rate for other loans was at that date on a limited basis we may provide additional credit to a borrower after the loan has been placed on nonaccrual status or modified as a tdr if in managements judgment the value of the property after the additional loan funding is greater than the initial value of the property plus the additional loan funding amount in no such additional credit was provided furthermore the terms of our restructured loans typically would not restrict us from cancelling outstanding commitments for other credit facilities to a borrower in the event of nonpayment of a restructured loan for additional information about our tdrs at december and see the discussion of asset quality in note loans and leases in item financial statements and supplementary data except for the nonaccrual loans and tdrs disclosed in this filing we did not have any potential problem loans at december that would have caused

methodology may be deemed to be more appropriate in the future in addition it should be noted that the portion of the allowance for losses on noncovered loans allocated to each noncovered loan category does not represent the total amount available to absorb losses that may occur within that category since the total loan loss allowance is available for the entire noncovered loan portfolio

repurchases and other corporate uses dividends paid to the parent company by the bank capital raised through the issuance of securities funding raised through the issuance of debt instruments and

accounts represented billion and million respectively at the corresponding dates at december we had billion of brokered cds compared to billion at december borrowed funds the majority of our borrowed funds are wholesale borrowings and consist of fhlbny advances repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased and to a lesser extent junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes at december

our ownership of stock in the fhlbny at december billion of our wholesale borrowings had callable features compared to billion at december also included in wholesale borrowings were repurchase agreements of million at december compared to million at december repurchase agreements are contracts for the sale of securities owned or borrowed by the bank with an agreement to repurchase those securities at agreedupon prices and dates our repurchase agreements are primarily collateralized by gse obligations and may be entered into with the fhlbny or certain brokerage firms the brokerage firms we utilize are subject to an ongoing internal financial review to ensure that we borrow funds only from those dealers whose financial strength will minimize the risk of loss due to default in addition a master repurchase agreement must be executed and on file for each of the brokerage firms we use we had no federal funds purchased at both december and junior subordinated debentures junior subordinated debentures totaled million at december slightly higher than the balance at the prior yearend reflecting discount accretion subordinated notes at december the balance of subordinated notes was million relatively unchanged from december see note borrowed funds in item financial statements and supplementary data for a further discussion of our wholesale borrowings and our junior subordinated debentures liquidity contractual obligations and offbalance sheet commitments and capital position liquidity we manage our liquidity to ensure that our cash flows are sufficient to support our operations and to compensate for any temporary mismatches between sources and uses of funds caused by variable loan and deposit demand we monitor our liquidity daily to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet our financial obligations our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents which totaled million and billion respectively at december and as in the past our loan and securities portfolios provided meaningful liquidity in with cash flows from the repayment and sale of loans totaling billion and cash flows from the repayment and sale of securities totaling billion additional liquidity stems from deposits and from our use of wholesale funding sources including brokered deposits and wholesale borrowings in addition we have access to the banks approved lines of credit with various counterparties including the fhlbny the availability of these wholesale funding sources is generally based on the amount of mortgage loan collateral available under a blanket lien we have pledged to the respective institutions and to a lesser extent the amount of available securities that may be pledged to collateralize our borrowings at december our available borrowing capacity with the fhlbny was billion in addition the bank had availableforsale securities of billion of which billion is unpledged furthermore the bank has agreements with the frbny that enable it to access the discount window as a further means of enhancing their liquidity in connection with these agreements the bank has pledged certain loans and securities to collateralize any funds they may borrow at december the maximum amount the bank could borrow from the frbny was billion there were no borrowings against either line of credit at december our primary investing activity is loan production and the volume of loans we originated for investment totaled billion in during this time the net cash used in investing activities totaled billion the net cash provided by our operating activities totaled million our financing activities provided net cash of million cds due to mature or reprice in one year or less from december totaled billion representing of total cds at that date our ability to attract and retain retail deposits including cds depends on numerous factors including among others the convenience of our branches and our other banking channels our customers satisfaction with the service they receive the rates of interest we offer the types of products we feature and the attractiveness of their terms our decision to compete for deposits also depends on numerous factors including among others our access to deposits through acquisitions the availability of lowercost funding sources the impact of competition on pricing and the need to fund our loan demand the parent company is a separate legal entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity in addition to operating expenses and any share repurchases the parent company is responsible for paying any dividends declared to our shareholders as a delaware corporation the parent company is able to pay dividends either from surplus or in case there is no surplus from net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared andor the preceding fiscal year the parent companys ability to pay dividends may also depend in part upon dividends it receives from the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends and other capital distributions to the parent company is generally limited by new york state banking law and regulations and by certain regulations of the fdic in addition the superintendent of the new york state department of financial services the superintendent the fdic and the frb for reasons of safety and soundness may prohibit the payment of dividends that are otherwise permissible by regulations under new york state banking law a new york statechartered stockform savings bank or commercial bank may declare and pay dividends out of its net profits unless there is an impairment of capital however the approval of the superintendent is required if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of a banks net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years in the bank paid dividends totaling million to the parent company leaving million that it could dividend to the parent company without regulatory approval at yearend additional sources of liquidity available to the parent company at december included million in cash and cash equivalents if the bank was to apply to the superintendent for approval to make a dividend or capital distribution in excess of the dividend amounts permitted under the regulations there can be no assurance that such application would be approved contractual obligations and offbalance sheet commitments in the normal course of business we enter into a variety of contractual obligations in order to manage our assets and liabilities fund loan growth operate our branch network and address our capital needs for example we offer cds with contractual terms to our customers and borrow funds under contract from the fhlbny and various brokerage firms these contractual obligations are reflected in the consolidated statements of condition under deposits and borrowed funds respectively at december we had cds of billion and longterm debt defined as borrowed funds with an original maturity in excess of one year of billion we also are obligated under certain noncancelable operating leases on the buildings and land we use in operating our branch network and in performing our backoffice responsibilities these obligations are included in the consolidated statements of condition and totaled million at december contractual

amount ratio required ratio common equity tier capital tier riskbased capital total riskbased capital leverage capital table end at december the capital ratios for the company and the bank continued to exceed the levels required for classification as well capitalized institutions as defined under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of and as further discussed in note capital in item financial statements and supplementary data results of operations as compared to net interest income net interest income is our primary source of income its level is a function of the average balance of our interestearning assets the average balance of our interestbearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities these factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of our interestearning assets and our interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by various external factors including the local economy competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the fomc and market interest rates the cost of our deposits and borrowed funds is largely based on shortterm rates of interest the level of which is partially impacted by the actions of the fomc the fomc reduces maintains or increases the target federal funds rate the rate at which banks borrow funds overnight from one another as it deems necessary in the fomc increased the target federal funds rate four times for a total of basis points to a target range of to while the target federal funds rate generally impacts the cost of our shortterm borrowings and deposits the yields on our heldforinvestment loans and other interestearning assets are typically impacted by intermediateterm market interest rates in the fiveyear cmt ranged from a low of to a high of with an average rate of for the year in the fiveyear cmt ranged from a low of to a high of with an average rate of for the year another factor that impacts the yields on our interestearning assetsand our net interest incomeis the income generated by our multifamily and cre loans and securities when they prepay since prepayment income is recorded as interest income an increase or decrease in its level will also be reflected in the average yields as applicable on our loans securities and interestearning assets and therefore in our net interest income our net interest rate spread and our net interest margin it should be noted that the level of prepayment income on loans recorded in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay during that time such activity is largely dependent on such external factors as current market conditions including real estate values and the perceived or actual direction of market interest rates in addition while a decline in market interest rates may trigger an increase in refinancing and therefore prepayment income so too may an increase in market interest rates it is not unusual for borrowers to lock in lower interest rates when they expect or see that market interest rates are rising rather than risk refinancing later at a still higher interest rate for the twelve months ended december net interest income declined million or to million total interest income rose million or for the twelve months ended december while total interest expense rose million or for the same time period yearoveryear comparison the following factors contributed to the yearoveryear decline in net interest income table start interest income increased million or to billion on a yearoveryear basis due to an million or increase in interest income from loans and a million or increase in interest income from securities table end table start the increase in interest income from loans was the result of a higher level of average loan balances in compared to as well as a higher yield on the loans average loans increased billion to billion up compared to at the same time the average yield on the loan portfolio rose ten basis points to yearoveryear in addition prepayment income contributed million and basis points to interest income and the average yield from loans respectively compared to million and ten basis points in the prior year table end table start the yearoveryear improvement in interest income from securities was driven by a billion increase in the average balance of securities partially offset by a ten basis point decline in the average yield to prepayment income added million and one basis point to the interest income and average yield from securities respectively relatively unchanged from table end table start the average balance of interestearning assets increased billion or to billion and the average yield rose basis points to table end table start interest expense increased million to million on a yearoveryear basis as interest expense on deposits rose million and interest expense on borrowed funds rose million table end table start the yearoveryear increase in interest expenses on deposits was due to a billion increase in the average balance of deposits mostly cd balances and a basis point increase in the average cost of deposits to table end table start the yearoveryear increase in interest expense from borrowed funds was driven primarily by a basis point increase in the average cost of borrowings while the average balance of borrowed funds was relatively unchanged table end table start as a result the average balance of interestbearing liabilities increased billion or to billion and our average cost increased basis points to table end net interest margin the direction of the companys net interest margin was consistent with that of its net interest income and generally was driven by the same factors as those described above at

subordinated notes offering is recorded in accordance with gaap adjusted net interest margin which excludes the contribution of prepayment income is not nevertheless management uses this nongaap measure in its analysis of our performance and believes that this nongaap measure should be disclosed in this report and other investor communications for the following reasons table start adjusted net interest margin gives investors a better understanding of the effect of prepayment income on our net interest margin prepayment income in any given period depends on the volume of loans that refinance or prepay or securities that prepay during that period such activity is largely dependent on external factors such as current market conditions including real estate values and the perceived

comparison with our peers table end adjusted net interest margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net interest margin which is calculated in accordance with gaap moreover the manner in which we calculate this nongaap measure may differ from that of other companies reporting a nongaap measure with a similar name the following table sets forth certain information regarding our average balance sheet for the years indicated including the average yields on our interestearning assets and the average costs of our interestbearing liabilities average yields are calculated by dividing the interest income produced by the average balance of interestearning assets average costs are calculated by dividing the interest expense produced by the average balance of interestbearing liabilities the average balances for the year are derived from average balances that are calculated daily the average yields and costs include fees as well as premiums and discounts

consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with gaap which requires that we measure our financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations unlike industrial companies nearly all of a banks assets and liabilities are monetary in nature as a result the impact of interest rates on our performance is greater than the impact of general levels of inflation interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services impact of recent accounting pronouncements recently issued accounting standards in august the fasb issued asu no fair value measurement topic disclosure framework changes to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurement the purpose of asu no is to improve the effectiveness of disclosures in the notes to financial statements by facilitating clear communication of the information required by gaap that is most important to users of each entitys financial statements the amendments in asu no are effective for the company as of january the amendments remove the disclosure requirements for transfers between levels and of the fair value hierarchy the disclosure of the policy for timing of transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy and the disclosure of the valuation processes for level fair value measurements additionally the amendments modify the disclosure requirements for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value and measurement uncertainty finally the amendments added disclosure requirements for the changes in unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income for recurring level fair value measurements and the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop level measurements the amendments on changes in unrealized gains and losses the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop level fair value measurements and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption all other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date the adoption of asu no is not expected to have a material effect on the companys consolidated statements of condition results of operations or cash flows in january the fasb issued asu no intangiblesgoodwill and other topic simplifying the test for goodwill impairment asu no eliminates the second step of the goodwill impairment test which requires an entity to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill instead an entity will recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit with the impairment loss not to exceed the amount of goodwill recorded asu no does not amend the optional qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment the company plans to adopt asu no prospectively beginning january and the impact of its adoption on the companys consolidated statements of condition results of operations or cash flows will be dependent upon goodwill impairment determinations made after that date in june the fasb issued asu no financial instrumentscredit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments asu no amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held on an amortized cost basis and availableforsale debt securities for assets held at amortized cost asu no eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in current gaap and instead requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses current gaap requires an incurred loss methodology for recognizing credit losses that delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred the amendments in asu no replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current gaap with a methodology that reflects the measurement of expected credit losses based on relevant information about past events including historical loss experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts the allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected for availableforsale debt securities credit losses should be measured in a manner similar to current gaap but will be presented as an allowance rather than as a writedown the amendments affect loans debt securities trade receivables offbalance sheet credit exposures reinsurance receivables and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash the company has developed a cecl allowance model which calculates reserves over the life of the asset or offbalance sheet credit exposure and is largely driven by portfolio characteristics riskgrading economic outlook and other key methodology assumptions the company has leveraged analyses derived from its stress testing processes in the development of cecl models the company will utilize a single economic forecast over a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period and will use straightline reversion to historical losses the company expects not more than a increase in the allowance for credit losses which will decrease the opening stockholders equity balance as of january the company is in the process of finalizing the review of the most recent model run and finalizing assumptions including quantative adjustments and probable troubled debt restructurings and implementation of operational processes and internal controls reconciliations of stockholders equity common stockholders equity and tangible common stockholders equity total assets and tangible assets
