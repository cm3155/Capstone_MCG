item quantitative and qualitati ve disclosures about market risk we manage our assets and liabilities to reduce our exposure to changes in market interest rates the asset and liability management process has three primary objectives to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain balance sheet accounts to determine the appropriate level of risk given our business strategy operating environment capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and to manage that risk in a manner consistent with guidelines approved by the boards of directors of the company and the bank market risk as a financial institution we are focused on reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility which represents our primary market risk changes in market interest rates represent the greatest challenge to our financial performance as such changes can have a significant impact on the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and on the market value of all interestearning assets other than those possessing a short term to maturity to reduce our exposure to changing rates the board of directors and management monitor interest rate sensitivity on a regular or as needed basis so that adjustments to the asset and liability mix can be made when deemed appropriate the actual duration of heldforinvestment mortgage loans and mortgagerelated securities can be significantly impacted by changes in prepayment levels and market interest rates the level of prepayments may in turn be impacted by a variety of factors including the economy in the region where the underlying mortgages were originated seasonal factors demographic variables and the assumability of the underlying mortgages however the factors with the most significant impact on prepayments are market interest rates and the availability of refinancing opportunities we managed our interest rate risk by taking the following actions we have continued to emphasize the origination and retention of intermediateterm assets primarily in the form of multifamily and cre loans we have continued the origination of certain ci loans that feature floating interest rates increased the focus on retaining low costs deposits and obtained new low cost deposits as part of the bankingasaservice initiative the use of derivatives to manage our interest rate position libor transition process and phase out the company has certain loans interest rate swap agreements investment securities and debt obligations whose interest rate is indexed to libor in the fca which is responsible for regulating libor announced that the publication of libor is not guaranteed beyond in december the administrator of libor announced its intention to i cease the publication of the oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor after december and ii cease the publication of all other tenors of us dollar libor one three six and 12month libor after june and on march announced that it will permanently cease to publish most libor settings beginning on january and cease to publish the overnight onemonth threemonth sixmonth and 12month us dollar libor settings on july accordingly the fca has stated that it does not intend to persuade or compel banks to submit to libor after such respective dates until such time however fca panel banks have agreed to continue to support libor in october the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a joint statement on managing the libor transition that offered their regulatory expectations and outlined potential supervisory and enforcement consequences for banks that fail to adequately plan for and implement the transition away from libor the failure to properly transition away from libor may result in increased supervisory scrutiny the implementation of a substitute index for the calculation of interest rates under the companys loan agreements may result in disputes or litigation with counterparties over the appropriateness or comparability to libor of the substitute index which would have an adverse effect on the companys results of operations even when robust fallback language is included there can be no assurances that the replacement rate plus any spread adjustment will be economically equivalent to libor which could result in a lower interest rate being paid to the company on such assets the alternative reference rates committee a group of privatemarket participants convened by the frb and the frbny has identified sofr as the recommended alternative to libor the use of sofr as a substitute for libor is voluntary and may not be suitable for all market participants sofr is calculated and observed differently than libor given the manner in which sofr is calculated it is likely to be lower than libor and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions market practices related to sofr calculation conventions continue to develop and may vary inconsistent calculation conventions among financial products may expose is to increased basic rate and resultant costs other alternatives to libor also exist but because of the difference in how those alternatives are constructed they may diverge significantly from libor in a range of situations and market conditions the bank established a subcommittee of alco to address issues related to the phase out and transition from libor this subcommittee consists of personnel from various departments through the bank including lending loan administration credit risk management financetreasury including interest rate risk and liquidity management information technology and operations the company has liborbased contracts that extend beyond june the subcommittee has monitored the banks libor transition progress and substantially all contracts have been updated in complying with industry requirements the bank has not offered new liborbased products since december interest rate sensitivity analysis interest rate sensitivity is monitored through the use of a model that generates estimates of the change in our economic value of equity over a range of interest rate scenarios eve is defined as the net present value of expected cash flows from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet contracts the eve ratio under any interest rate scenario is defined as the eve in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario the model assumes estimated loan prepayment rates reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates based on the information and assumptions in effect at december the following table sets forth our eve assuming the changes in interest rates noted table start dollars in millions change in interest rates in basis points market value of assets market value of liabilities economic value of equity net change estimated percentage change in economic value of equity table end the net changes in eve presented in the preceding table are within the parameters approved by the boards of directors of the company and the bank modeling changes in eve requires that certain assumptions be made which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates in this regard the eve analysis presented above assumes that the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities furthermore the model does not take into account the benefit of any strategic actions we may take to further reduce our exposure to interest rate risk accordingly while the eve analysis provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and may very well differ from actual results we also utilize an internal net interest income simulation to manage our sensitivity to interest rate risk the simulation incorporates various marketbased assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on future levels of our financial assets and liabilities the assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the following table due to the frequency timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories and prepayments among other factors coupled with any actions taken to counter the effects of any such changes based on the information and assumptions in effect at december the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in future net interest income for the next twelve months assuming the changes in interest rates noted table start change in interest rates in basis points estimated percentage change in future net interest income over one year over one year over one year over one year table end in general short and longterm rates are assumed to increase in parallel instantaneously and then remain unchanged future changes in our mix of assets and liabilities may result in greater changes to our gap npv andor net interest income simulation in the event that our eve and net interest income sensitivities were to breach our internal policy limits we would undertake the following actions to ensure that appropriate remedial measures were put in place in formulating appropriate strategies the alco committee would ascertain the primary causes of the variance from policy tolerances the expected term of such conditions and the projected effect on capital and earnings our alco committee would inform the board of directors of the variance and present recommendations to the board regarding proposed courses of action to restore conditions to withinpolicy tolerances where temporary changes in market conditions or volume levels result in significant increases in risk strategies may involve reducing open positions or employing other balance sheet management activities including the potential use of derivatives to reduce the risk exposure where variance from policy tolerances is triggered by more fundamental imbalances in the risk profiles of core loan and deposit products a remedial strategy may involve restoring balance through natural hedges to the extent possible before employing synthetic hedging techniques other strategies might include asset restructuring involving sales of assets having higher risk profiles or a gradual restructuring of the asset mix over time to affect the maturity or repricing schedule of assets liability restructuring whereby product offerings and pricing are altered or wholesale borrowings are employed to affect the maturity structure or repricing of liabilities expansion or shrinkage of the balance sheet to correct imbalances in the repricing or maturity periods between assets and liabilities andor use or alteration of offbalance sheet positions including interest rate swaps caps floors options and forward purchase or sales commitments in connection with our net interest income simulation modeling we also evaluate the impact of changes in the slope of the yield curve at december our analysis indicated that a further inversion of the yield curve would be expected to result in a decrease in net interest income conversely an immediate steepening of the yield curve would be expected to result in a increase in net interest income critical accounting estimates the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods actual results may differ from these estimates under varying conditions on a quarterly basis management evaluate its estimates particularly those that involve the most difficult subjective or complex judgments and are often about matters that are inherently uncertain the judgments used by management in applying these critical accounting estimates may be influenced by adverse changes in the economic environment which may result in changes to future financial results allowance for credit losses the companys january adoption of asu no measurement of credit losses on financial instruments resulted in a significant change to our methodology for estimating the allowance since december asu no replaced the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the cecl methodology the measurement of expected credit losses under cecl is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost including loan receivables it also applies to offbalance sheet exposures not accounted for as insurance and net investments in leases accounted for under asc topic at december the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases totaled million on january the company adopted the cecl methodology under asu topic and recognized an increase in the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases of million as a day transition adjustment from changes in methodology with a corresponding decrease in retained earnings separately at december the company had an allowance for unfunded commitments of million upon adoption the company recognized an increase in the allowance for unfunded commitments of million as a day transition adjustment with a corresponding decrease in retained earnings the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases is deducted from the amortized cost basis of a financial asset or a group of financial assets so that the balance sheet reflects the net amount the company expects to collect amortized cost is the unpaid loan balance net of deferred fees and expenses and includes negative escrow subsequent changes favorable and unfavorable in expected credit losses are recognized immediately in net income as a credit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense management estimates the allowance by projecting and multiplying together the probabilityofdefault lossgivendefault and exposureatdefault depending on economic parameters for each month of the remaining contractual term economic parameters are developed using available information relating to past events current conditions and economic forecasts the companys economic forecast period is months and afterwards reverts to a historical average loss rate on a straight line basis over a month period historical credit experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses with qualitative adjustments made for differences in current loanspecific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards portfolio mix delinquency levels and terms as well as for changes in environmental conditions such as changes in legislation regulation policies administrative practices or other relevant factors expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans adjusted for forecasted prepayments when appropriate the contractual term excludes potential extensions or renewals the methodology used in the estimation of the allowance for loan and lease losses which is performed at least quarterly is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and forecasted economic conditions each quarter the company reassesses the appropriateness of the economic forecasting period the reversion period and historical mean at the portfolio segment level considering any required adjustments for differences in underwriting standards portfolio mix and other relevant data shifts over time the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist the portfolio segment represents the level at which a systematic methodology is applied to estimate credit losses management believes the products within each of the entitys portfolio segments exhibit similar risk characteristics smaller pools of homogenous financing receivables with homogeneous risk characteristics were modeled using the methodology selected for the portfolio segment the macroeconomic data used in the quantitative models are based on a reasonable and supportable forecast period of months the company leverages economic projections including property market and prepayment forecasts from established independent third parties to inform its loss drivers in the forecast beyond this forecast period the company reverts to a historical average loss rate this reversion to the historical average loss rate is performed on a straightline basis over months loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis these include loans that are in nonaccrual status with balances above management determined materiality thresholds depending on loan class and also loans that are designated as tdr or reasonably expected tdr criticized classified or maturing loans that will have a modification processed within the next three months if a loan is determined to be collateral dependent or meets the criteria to apply the collateral dependent practical expedient expected credit losses are determined based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date less costs to sell as appropriate the company maintains an allowance for credit losses on offbalance sheet credit exposures the company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the company the allowance for credit losses on offbalance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit losses expense the estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over their estimated life the company examined historical credit conversion factor ccf trends to estimate utilization rates and chose an appropriate mean ccf based on both management judgment and quantitative analysis quantitative analysis involved examination of ccfs over a range of fundup windows between and months and comparison of the mean ccf for each fundup window with management judgment determining whether the highest mean ccf across fundup windows made business sense the company applies the same standards and estimated loss rates to the credit exposures as to the related class of loans when applying this critical accounting estimate we incorporate several inputs and judgments that may be influenced by changes period to period these include but are not limited to changes in the economic environment and forecasts changes in the credit profile and characteristics of the loan portfolio and changes in prepayment assumptions which will result in provisions to or recoveries from the balance of the allowance for credit losses while changes to the economic environment forecasts and portfolio characteristics will change from period to period portfolio prepayments are an integral assumption in estimating the allowance for credit losses on our commercial real estate portfolio multi family cre and adc which comprises of the loan portfolio at december portfolio prepayments are subject to estimation uncertainty and changes in this assumption could have a material impact to our estimation process prepayment assumptions are sensitive to interest rates and existing loan terms and determine the weighted average life of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio excluding other factors as the weighted average life of the portfolio increases or decreases so will the required amount of the allowance for credit losses on commercial real estate valuation of mortgage servicing rights we purchase and originate mortgage loans for sale to the secondary market and often retain the right to service the loan at the time of sale upon which a mortgage servicing right msr is created we have elected to report our msr assets at fair value which is determined using an internal valuation model that utilizes an optionadjusted spread constant prepayment rates costs to service and other assumptions the assumptions used in the msr valuation are unobservable in nature involve a higher degree of judgment and are estimated based on our judgment regarding the value that market participants would assign to the asset to corroborate this estimate we obtain thirdparty valuations of the msr portfolio on a quarterly basis from independent valuation services to assess the reasonableness of the fair value calculated by the internal valuation model for further information and sensitivity analysis regarding the valuation of the msr asset see note fair value measurements in item financial statements and supplementary data acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method of accounting requires that acquired assets and liabilities in a business combination be recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date this method often involves estimates all of which are inherently subjective we have elected to hold the measurement period open to allow for potential adjustments for up to one year after the acquisition date for new information that existed at the acquisition date but may not have been known or available at that time for further information refer to note business combination in item financial statements and supplementary data
