the investment agreements the registration rights agreement the issued warrant and the transactions contemplated thereby are not complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the investment agreements which are filed as exhibits to this annual report on for a detailed description of the federal state and local regulations to which the company and the bank are subject as a category iv banking organization with over billion in assets we are subject to stringent regulations including reporting capital stress testing and liquidity risk management noncompliance could result in regulatory risks and restrictions on our activities as a result of the signature transaction our total assets exceeded billion and therefore we became classified as a category iv banking organization under the rules issued by the federal banking agencies that tailor the application of enhanced prudential standards to large bank holding companies and the capital and liquidity rules to large bank holding companies and depository institutions under the doddfrank act and the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act as a category iv banking organization we are subject to enhanced liquidity risk management requirements which include reporting liquidity stress testing a liquidity buffer and resolution planning subject to the applicable transition periods if we were to meet or exceed certain other thresholds for asset size we would become subject to additional requirements failure to meet these requirements could expose us to compliance risks higher penalties increased expectations and limitations on our activities as a category iv banking organization we are required to implement and maintain an adequate liquidity risk management and monitoring process to ensure compliance with these requirements and our failure to ensure compliance may have adverse consequences on our operations reputation and future profitability we anticipate incurring significant expenses to develop policies programs and systems that comply with the enhanced standards applicable to us noncompliance with the bank secrecy act and other antimoney laundering statutes and regulations could result in material financial loss the bsa and the usa patriot act contain antimoney laundering and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the us financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities the bsa as amended by the usa patriot act requires depository institutions to undertake activities including maintaining an antimoney laundering program verifying the identity of clients monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions reporting on cash transactions above a certain threshold and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies fincen a unit of the us treasury department that administers the bsa is authorized to impose significant civil monetary penalties for violations of these requirements if our bsa policies procedures and systems are deemed to be deficient or the bsa policies procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we acquire in the future are deficient we would be subject to reputational risk and potential liability including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan including our acquisition plans which would negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations failure to comply with ofac regulations could result in legal and reputational risks the united states has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries foreign nationals and other potentially exposed persons these are typically referred to as the ofac rules given their administration by the united states treasury department office of foreign assets control failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences our enterprise risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating the risks to which we are subject based upon the size scope and complexity of the company as a financial institution we are subject to a number of risks including interest rate credit liquidity legalcompliance market strategic operational and reputational our erm framework is designed to minimize the risks to which we are subject as well as any losses stemming from such risks although we seek to identify measure monitor report and control our exposure to such risks and employ a broad and diverse set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques in the process those techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or development of risks that are currently unknown and unanticipated for example economic and market conditions heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry and increases in the overall complexity of our operations among other developments have resulted in the creation of a variety of risks that were previously unknown and unanticipated highlighting the intrinsic limitations of our risk monitoring and mitigation techniques as a result the further development of previously unknown or unanticipated risks may result in our incurring losses in the future that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations furthermore an ineffective erm framework as well as other risk factors could result in a material increase in our fdic insurance premiums if federal state or local tax authorities were to determine that we did not adequately provide for our taxes our income tax expense could be increased adversely affecting our earnings the amount of income taxes we are required to pay on our earnings is based on federal state and local legislation and regulations we provide for current and deferred taxes in our financial statements based on our results of operations business activity legal structure interpretation of tax statutes assessment of risk of adjustment upon audit and application of financial accounting standards we may take tax return filing positions for which the final determination of tax is uncertain and our net income and earnings per share could be reduced if a federal state or local authority were to assess additional taxes that have not been provided for in our consolidated financial statements in addition there can be no assurance that we will achieve our anticipated effective tax rate unanticipated changes in tax laws or related regulatory or judicial guidance or an audit assessment that denies previously recognized tax benefits could result in our recording tax expenses that materially reduce our net income we are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers including the community reinvestment act and fair lending laws and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions the cra requires the federal reserve and occ to assess our performance in meeting the credit needs of the communities we serve including low and moderateincome neighborhoods if the federal reserve or occ determines that we need to improve our performance or are in substantial noncompliance with cra requirements various adverse regulatory consequences may ensue in addition the equal credit opportunity act the fair housing act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions the cfpb the us department of justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations the cfpb is also authorized to prescribe rules applicable to any covered person or service provider identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are unfair deceptive or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service or the offering of a consumer financial product or service a successful regulatory challenge to an institutions performance under the cra fair lending laws or regulations or consumer lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions including damages and civil money penalties injunctive relief restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institutions performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally state attorneys general have indicated that they intend to take a more active role in enforcing consumer protection laws including through use of doddfrank act provisions that authorize state attorneys general to enforce certain provisions of federal consumer financial laws and obtain civil money penalties and other relief available to the cfpb if we become subject to such investigation the required response could result in substantial costs and a diversion of the attention and resources of our management legislative and regulatory focus on data privacy and risks can subject us to heightened scrutiny and reputational damage data privacy and cybersecurity risks have become a subject of heightened legislative and regulatory focus in recent years federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed regulations to enhance cyber risk management standards which would apply to us and our thirdparty service providers these regulations focus on areas such as cyber risk governance management of dependencies incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness statelevel legislation and regulations have also been proposed or adopted requiring notification to individuals in the event of a security breach of their personal data examples include the california consumer privacy act ccpa and other statelevel privacy data protection and data security laws and regulations we collect maintain and use nonpublic personal information of our customers clients employees and others the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are governed by federal and state laws compliance with these laws is essential to protect the privacy of personal information and avoid potential liability and reputational damage failure to comply with privacy laws and regulations may expose us to fines litigation or regulatory enforcement actions it may also require changes to our systems business practices or privacy policies which could adversely impact our operating results privacy initiatives have imposed and will continue to impose additional operational burdens on us these initiatives may limit our ability to pursue desirable business initiatives and increase the risks associated with any future use of personal data new privacy and data protection initiatives such as the ccpa may require changes to policies procedures and technology for information security and data segregation noncompliance with these initiatives may make us more vulnerable to operational failures and subject to monetary penalties litigation or regulatory enforcement actions financial and market risks a decline in economic conditions could adversely affect the value of the loans we originate and the securities in which we invest declines in real estate values and an increase in the financial stress on borrowers stemming from high unemployment or other adverse economic conditions could negatively affect our borrowers and in turn the repayment of the loans in our portfolio deterioration in economic conditions also could subject us and our industry to increased regulatory scrutiny and could result in an increase in loan delinquencies an increase in problem assets and foreclosures and a decline in the value of the collateral for our loans which could reduce our customers borrowing power deterioration in local economic conditions could drive the level of loan losses beyond the level we have provided for in our loan loss allowance this in turn could necessitate an increase in our provisions for loan losses which would reduce our earnings and capital furthermore declines in the value of our investment securities could result in our having to record losses based on the otherthantemporary impairment of securities which would reduce our earnings and also could reduce our capital in addition continued economic weakness could reduce the demand for our products and services which would adversely impact our liquidity and the revenues we produce rising mortgage rates and adverse changes in mortgage market conditions could reduce mortgage revenue the residential real estate mortgage lending business is sensitive to changes in interest rates especially longterm interest rates lower interest rates generally increase the volume of mortgage originations while higher interest rates generally cause that volume to decrease therefore our mortgage performance is typically correlated to fluctuations in interest rates primarily the 10year us treasury rate historically mortgage origination volume and sales for the bank and for other financial institutions have risen and fallen in response to these and other factors an increase in interest rates andor a decrease in our mortgage production volume could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results the 10year us treasury rate was percent at december and averaged percent during basis points higher than average rates experienced during the sustained higher rates experienced throughout negatively impacted the mortgage market including our loan origination volume and refinancing activity in addition to being affected by interest rates the secondary mortgage markets are also subject to investor demand for residential mortgage loans and investor yield requirements for these loans these conditions may fluctuate or worsen in the future adverse market conditions including increased volatility changes in interest rates and mortgage spreads and reduced market demand could result in greater risk in retaining mortgage loans pending their sale to investors a prolonged period of secondary market illiquidity may result in a reduction of our loan mortgage production volume and could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our mortgage origination business is also subject to the cyclical and seasonal trends of the real estate market the cyclical nature of our industry could lead to periods of growth in the mortgage and real estate markets followed by periods of declines and losses in such markets seasonal trends have historically reflected the general patterns of residential and commercial real estate sales which typically peak in the spring and summer seasons one of the primary influences on our mortgage business is the aggregate demand for mortgage loans which is affected by prevailing interest rates housing supply and demand residential construction trends and overall economic conditions if we are unable to respond to the cyclical nature of our industry by appropriately adjusting our operations or relying on the strength of our other product offerings during cyclical downturns our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected additionally the fair value of our msrs is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in market implied interest rate volatility decreases in interest rates can trigger an increase in actual repayments and market expectation for higher levels of repayments in the future which have a negative impact on msr fair value conversely higher rates typically drive lower repayments which results in an increase in the msr fair value we utilize derivatives to manage the impact of changes in the fair value of the msrs we may have basis risk and our risk management strategies which rely on assumptions or projections may not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates interest rate volatility convexity credit spreads or prepayment speeds and as a result the change in the fair value of msrs may negatively impact earnings we are highly dependent on the agencies to buy mortgage loans that we originate changes in these entities and changes in the manner or volume of loans they purchase or their current roles could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we generate mortgage revenues primarily from gains on the sale of singlefamily residential loans pursuant to programs currently offered by fannie mae freddie mac ginnie mae and other investors these entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans any future changes in these programs our eligibility to participate in such programs their concentration limits with respect to loans purchased from us the criteria for loans to be accepted or laws that significantly affect the activity of such entities could in turn result in a lower volume of corresponding loan originations or other administrative costs which may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations or could cause us to take other actions that would be materially detrimental fannie mae and freddie mac remain in conservatorship and a path forward for them to emerge from conservatorship is unclear their roles could be reduced modified or eliminated as a result of regulatory actions and the nature of their guarantees could be limited or eliminated relative to historical measurements the elimination or modification of the traditional roles of fannie mae or freddie mac could create additional competition in the market and significantly and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations changes in the servicing origination or underwriting guidelines or criteria required by the agencies could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we are required to follow specific guidelines or criteria that impact the way we originate underwrite or service loans guidelines include credit standards for mortgage loans our staffing levels and other servicing practices the servicing and ancillary fees that we may charge modification standards and procedures and the amount of nonreimbursable advances we cannot negotiate these terms which are subject to change at any time with the agencies a significant change in these guidelines which decreases the fees we charge or requires us to expend additional resources in providing mortgage services could decrease our revenues or increase our costs adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in the nature or extent of the guarantees provided by fannie mae and freddie mac or the insurance provided by the fha could also have broad adverse market implications the fees that we are required to pay to the agencies for these guarantees have changed significantly over time and any future increases in these fees would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations future sales or issuances of our common stock or other securities including warrants or the issuance of securities pursuant to the exercise of warrants issued by us may dilute existing holders of our common stock and other securities decrease the value of our common stock and other securities and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and other securities during the fourth quarter of the company took decisive actions to build capital reinforce our balance sheet strengthen our risk management processes and better align the company with relevant bank peers we significantly built our reserve levels by recording a million provision for loan losses bringing our allowance for credit losses to million at december reflecting our actions to build reserves during the quarter to address weakness in the office sector potential repricing risk in the multifamily portfolio and an increase in classified assets which better aligns the company with its relevant bank peers including category iv banks we are also subject to regulatory capital requirements and regulatory changes could result in more stringent capital or liquidity requirements including increases in the levels of regulatory capital we are required to maintain and changes in the way capital or liquidity is measured for regulatory purposes accordingly we may seek to raise additional capital including by pursuing or effecting additional issuances of our securities our ability to raise additional capital and the associated terms depends on conditions in the capital markets economic conditions and a number of other factors including investor perceptions regarding the financial services and banking industry market conditions and governmental activities and on our financial condition and performance on march we completed an approximately billion equity investment in the company in connection with which we sold and issued a  of our common stock at a purchase price per share of b  of a new series of our preferred stock par value per share designated as series b noncumulative convertible preferred stock at a price per share of each share of which is convertible into  of common stock c  of a new series of our preferred stock par value per share designated as series c noncumulative convertible preferred stock at a price per share of each share of which is convertible into  of common stock and d warrants which may not be exercised until days after issuance thereof affording the holder thereof the right until the sevenyear anniversary of the issuance of such warrant to purchase for per share shares of a new class of nonvoting commonequivalent preferred stock of the company each share of which is convertible into  of common stock and all of which shares of series d nvce stock upon issuance will represent the right on an as converted basis to receive million shares of common stock additionally if the company is not able to obtain certain approvals from our stockholders on or before september then the company will be required to issue to the investors in the march capital raise cashsettled warrants which would become exercisable days after their issuance if the such stockholder approvals still have not been obtained at such time that provide the holder thereof the right until the tenyear anniversary of the issuance of such warrant to receive from the company cash in an amount equal to i from issuance thereof until and including november percent of such holders investment in the company in the march capital raise ii on and including november until and including january percent of such holders investment in the company in the march capital raise iii on and including january until and including march percent of such holders investment in the company in the march capital raise and iv from and after march percent of such holders investment in the company in the march capital raise in each case net of the exercise price which is the amount of such holders investment in the company in the march capital raise our board of directors has the authority in many situations to issue additional shares of authorized but unissued stock including securities convertible or exchangeable for stock in public or private offerings without any vote of our shareholders if in the future the company is required or otherwise determines to raise additional capital including through the issuance of additional securities any such capital raise or issuance may dilute the percentage of ownership interest of existing shareholders may dilute the per share book value of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and other securities no assurance can be given that in the future the company will be able to i raise any required capital or ii raise capital on terms that are beneficial to shareholders strategic risks extensive competition for loans and deposits could adversely affect our ability to expand our business as well as our financial condition and results of operations because our profitability stems from our ability to attract deposits and originate loans our continued ability to compete for depositors and borrowers is critical to our success our success as a competitor depends on a number of factors including our ability to develop maintain and build longterm relationships with our customers by providing them with convenience in the form of multiple branch locations extended hours of service and access through alternative delivery channels a broad and diverse selection of products and services interest rates and service fees that compare favorably with those of our competitors and skilled and knowledgeable personnel to assist our customers by addressing their financial needs external factors that may impact our ability to compete include among others the entry of new lenders and depository institutions in our current markets and with regard to lending an increased focus on multifamily and cre lending by existing competitors limitations on our ability to grow our loan portfolios could adversely affect our ability to generate interest income as well our financial condition and results of operations perhaps materially our portfolios of multifamily and cre loans represent the largest portion of our asset mix percent of total loans held for investment as of december our leadership position in these markets has been instrumental to our production of solid earnings and our consistent record of exceptional asset quality we monitor the ratio of our multifamily cre and adc loans as defined in the cre guidance to our total riskbased capital for compliance with regulatory guidance any inability to grow our multifamily and cre loan portfolios could negatively impact our ability to grow our earnings per share the inability to engage in merger transactions or to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions in which we might engage could adversely affect our ability to compete with other financial institutions and weaken our financial performance our ability to engage in future mergers and acquisitions depends on our ability to identify suitable merger partners and acquisition opportunities our ability to finance and complete negotiated transactions at acceptable prices and on acceptable terms and our ability to obtain the necessary stockholder and regulatory approvals if we are unable to engage in or complete a desired acquisition or merger transaction our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted as acquisitions have been a significant source of deposits the inability to complete a business combination could require that we increase the interest rates we pay on deposits in order to attract such funding through our current branch network or that we increase our use of wholesale funds increasing our cost of funds could adversely impact our net interest income and our net income furthermore the absence of acquisitions could impact our ability to fulfill our loan demand in addition mergers and acquisitions can lead to uncertainties about the future on the part of customers and employees such uncertainties could cause customers and others to consider changing their existing business relationships with the company to be acquired and could cause its employees to accept positions with other companies before the merger occurs as a result the ability of a company to attract and retain customers and to attract retain and motivate key personnel prior to a mergers completion could be impaired furthermore no assurance can be given that acquired operations would not adversely affect our existing profitability that we would be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by our existing banking business that we would be able to compete effectively in the market areas served by acquired branches or that we would be able to manage any growth resulting from a transaction effectively in particular our ability to compete effectively in new markets would be dependent on our ability to understand those markets and their competitive dynamics and our ability to retain certain key employees from the acquired institution who know those markets better than we do we may be exposed to challenges in combining the operations of acquired or merged businesses including our recent flagstar acquisition and signature acquisition into our operations which may prevent us from achieving the expected benefits from our merger and acquisition activities we may not be able to fully achieve the strategic objectives and operating efficiencies that we anticipate in our merger and acquisition activities inherent uncertainties exist in integrating the operations of an acquired business we may lose our customers or the customers of acquired entities as a result of the acquisitions we may also lose key personnel from the acquired entity as a result of an acquisition we may not discover all known and unknown factors when examining a company for acquisition or merger during the due diligence period these factors could produce unintended and unexpected consequences for us including but not limited to increased compliance and legal risks including increased litigation or regulatory actions such as fines or restrictions related to the business practices or operations of the combined business undiscovered factors as a result of an acquisition or merger could bring civil criminal and financial liabilities against us our management and the management of those entities we acquire or merge with in addition if difficulties arise with respect to the integration process we may incur higher integration expenses than anticipated and the economic benefits expected to result from the acquisition including revenue growth and cost savings might not occur or might not occur to the extent we expected failure to successfully integrate businesses that we acquire or merge with could have an adverse effect on our profitability return on equity return on assets or our ability to implement our strategy any of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the success of the signature transaction will depend on a number of uncertain factors including our decisions regarding the fair value of the assets acquired and the bargain purchase gain recorded on the transaction which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and future prospects our acquisition of certain assets of signature bank in march was an fdicassisted transaction and the expedited nature of the fdicassisted transaction did not allow bidders the time and access to information customarily associated with preparing for and evaluating a negotiated transaction as a result fair value estimates we have made in connection with the signature transaction may be inaccurate and subject to change which could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and future prospects in addition we may obtain additional information and evidence during the period of one year from march the date we completed the signature transaction that may result in changes to the estimated amounts recorded as of december which could change the amount of the bargain purchase gain we have recorded adjustments to this gain may be recorded based on additional information received after the acquisition date that affect the measurement of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and any decrease in the amount of bargain purchase gain we have recorded could also adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and future prospects operational risks our stress testing processes rely on analytical and forecasting models that may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate which could adversely affect the effectiveness of our strategic planning and our ability to pursue certain corporate goals the processes we use to estimate the effects of changing interest rates real estate values and economic indicators such as unemployment on our financial condition and results of operations depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models these models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances furthermore even if our assumptions are accurate predictors of future performance the models they are based on may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or implementation if the models we use in the process of managing our interest rate and other risks prove to be inadequate or inaccurate we could incur increased or unexpected losses which in turn could adversely affect our earnings and capital additionally failure by the company to maintain compliance with strict capital liquidity and other stress test requirements under banking regulations could subject us to regulatory sanctions including limitations on our ability to pay dividends the company entities that we have acquired and certain of our service providers have experienced information technology security breaches and may be vulnerable to future security breaches these incidents have resulted in and could result in additional expenses exposure to civil litigation increased regulatory scrutiny losses and a loss of customers any of which could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our stock communication and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business as we use such systems and those maintained and provided to us by thirdparty service providers to manage our customer relationships our general ledger our deposits and our loans in addition our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks although we and entities we have acquired take and have taken protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant the security of our computer systems software and networks as well as the security of the computer systems software and networks of certain of our service providers have been and may in the future be vulnerable to breaches unauthorized access misuse computer viruses or other malicious code and cyberattacks that have had and could have an impact on information security with the rise and permeation of online and mobile banking the financial services industry in particular faces substantial cybersecurity risk due to the type of sensitive information provided by customers we and our thirdparty service providers have been and may in the future be subject to cybersecurity incidents including those that involve the unauthorized access to customer information affecting other financial institutions and industry groups our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers and customers are regularly the subject of attempted attacks that are increasingly sophisticated and it is possible that we or they could experience a significant event in the future that could adversely affect our business or operations in addition breaches of security have in the past and may in the future occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having authorized or unauthorized access to our confidential or other information or that of our customers clients or counterparties certain previously identified cyber incidents have resulted and future such events could result in the breach of confidential and other information processed and stored in our computer systems and networks these events could cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers clients or counterparties further we may not know that an attack occurred until well after the event even after discovering an attempt or breach occurred we may not know the extent of the impact of the attack for some period of time this could cause us significant reputational damage or result in our experiencing significant losses while we diligently assess applicable regulatory and legislative developments affecting our business laws and regulations relating to cybersecurity have been frequently changing imposing new requirements on us in light of these conditions we face the potential for additional regulatory scrutiny that will lead to increasing compliance and technology expenses and in some cases possible limitations on the achievement of our plans for growth and other strategic objectives we may also be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks including expenses for thirdparty expert consultants or outside counsel we are currently subject to litigation regarding cyber incidents and we also may be subject to future litigation and financial losses that either are not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance we maintain or any thirdparty indemnification or insurance we believe that the impact of any previously identified cyber incidents including those subject to ongoing investigation and remediation will not have a material financial impact in addition we routinely transmit and receive personal confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means we have discussed and worked with our customers clients and counterparties to develop secure transmission capabilities but we do not have and may be unable to put in place secure capabilities with all of these constituents and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information we maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure we will timely and sufficiently notify our investors of material cybersecurity risks and incidents including the associated financial legal or reputational consequence of such an event as well as reviewing and updating any prior disclosures relating to the risk or event while we have established information security policies procedures and controls including an incident response plan to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures and interruptions we may not be able to anticipate all possible security breaches that could affect our systems or information and there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or will be adequately prevented or mitigated by our policies procedures and controls if they do the company and the bank rely on third parties to perform certain key business functions which may expose us to further operational risk we outsource certain key aspects of our data processing to certain thirdparty providers while we have selected these thirdparty providers carefully we cannot control their actions our ability to deliver products and services to our customers to adequately process and account for our customers transactions or otherwise conduct our business could be adversely impacted by any disruption in the services provided by these third parties their failure to handle current or higher volumes of usage or any difficulties we may encounter in communicating with them replacing these thirdparty providers also could entail significant delay and expense our thirdparty providers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses phishing schemes and other security breaches threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other thirdparty providers and their personnel we may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches and computer viruses or to alleviate problems caused by such security breaches or viruses to the extent that the activities of our thirdparty providers or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims regulatory scrutiny litigation and other possible liabilities these types of thirdparty relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and oversight by federal bank regulators such as the federal reserve board the office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance corporation and the cfpb as a result if our regulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over vendors and subcontractors or other ongoing thirdparty business relationships or that such thirdparties have not performed appropriately we could be subject to enforcement actions including civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for consumer remediation in addition the company may not be adequately insured against all types of losses resulting from thirdparty failures and our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from systems failures or other disruptions to our banking services failure to keep pace with technological changes could have a material adverse impact on our ability to compete for loans and deposits and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations financial products and services have become increasingly technologydriven our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively and in a costefficient manner is dependent on our ability to keep pace with technological advances and invest in new technology as it becomes available many of our competitors have greater resources than we do and may be better equipped to invest in and market new technologydriven products and services the inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely impact our operations to a large degree our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel whose expertise knowledge of our markets and years of industry experience make them difficult to replace competition for skilled leaders in our industry can be intense and we may not be able to hire or retain the people we would like to have working for us the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business given the specialized knowledge of such personnel and the difficulty of finding qualified replacements on a timely basis furthermore our ability to attract and retain personnel with the skills and knowledge to support our business may require that we offer additional compensation and benefits that would reduce our earnings the transition to a new chief executive officer will be critical to our success and our business may be adversely impacted if we do not successfully manage the transition process in a timely manner our success depends in part on the effectiveness of our transition to our new ceo joseph m otting on april the new ceo will be critical to executing on and achieving our vision strategic direction culture products and technology if we are unable to execute an orderly transition and successfully integrate the new ceo into our leadership team our operations and financial conditions may be adversely affected many aspects of our operations are dependent upon the soundness of other financial intermediaries and thus could expose us to systemic risk the soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of relationships between them involving credit trading execution of transactions and the like as a result concerns about or a default or threatened default by one institution could lead to significant marketwide liquidity and credit problems losses or defaults by other institutions as such systemic risk may adversely affect the financial intermediaries with which we interact on a daily basis such as clearing agencies clearing houses banks and securities firms and exchanges we could be adversely impacted as well we may be terminated as a servicer or subservicer or incur costs liabilities fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions at december we had relationships with owners of msrs excluding ourselves for which we act as subservicer for the mortgage loans they own due to the limited number of relationships discontinuation of existing agreements with those third parties or adverse changes in contractual terms could have a significant negative impact to our mortgage servicing revenue the terms and conditions in which a master servicer may terminate subservicing contracts are broad and could be exercised at the discretion of the master servicer without requiring cause additionally the master servicer directs the oversight of custodial deposits associated with serviced loans and to the extent allowable could choose to transfer the oversight of the banks custodial deposits to another depository institution further as servicer or subservicer of loans we have certain contractual obligations including foreclosing on defaulted mortgage loans or to the extent applicable considering alternatives to foreclosure if we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice causing us to lose servicing income we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans pay fees or indemnify buyers against losses when selling mortgage loans we provide customary representations and warranties to purchasers guarantors and insurers including the agencies regarding loan originations agreements may require repurchasing substituting mortgage loans or indemnify buyers against losses in the event we breach these representations or warranties we may also face litigation and associated costs with respect to loans that are originated through our broker or correspondent channels the remedies against originating brokers or correspondents may be limited posing financial risk if repurchase and indemnity demands increase our liquidity results of operations and financial condition may also be adversely affected additionally servicing errors may lead to reimbursement obligations we may have a significant reduction to noninterest income or an increase to noninterest expense we may incur legal and documentrelated expenses from foreclosure actions these challenges could harm our reputation or negatively affect our servicing business and as a result our profitability the pipeline represents the upb for loans the agencies identified as potentially needing to be repurchased and the estimated probable loss associated with these loans is included in our representation and warranty reserve while we believe the level of the reserve to be appropriate the reserve may not be adequate to cover losses for loans that we have sold or securitized for which we may be subsequently required to repurchase pay fines or fees or indemnify purchasers and insurers because of violations of customary representations and warranties additionally the pipeline could increase substantially without warning our regulators as part of their supervisory function may review our representation and warranty reserve for losses and may recommend or require us to increase our reserve based upon their judgment which may differ from that of management we utilize thirdparty mortgage originators which subjects us to strategic reputation compliance and operational risk we utilize thirdparty mortgage originators ie mortgage brokers and correspondent lenders who are not our employees these third parties originate mortgages or provide services to many different banks and other entities accordingly they may have relationships with or loyalties to such banks and other parties that are different from those they have with or to us failure to maintain good relations with such thirdparty mortgage originators could have a negative impact on our market share which would negatively impact our results of operations we rely on thirdparty mortgage originators to originate and document the mortgage loans we purchase or originate while we perform due diligence on the mortgage companies with whom we do business as well as review the loan files and loan documents we purchase to attempt to detect any irregularities or legal noncompliance we have less control over these originators than employees of the bank due to regulatory scrutiny our thirdparty mortgage originators could choose or be required to either reduce the scope of their business or exit the mortgage origination business altogether the tilarespa integrated disclosure rule issued by the cfpb establishes comprehensive mortgage disclosure requirements for lenders and settlement agents in connection with most closedend consumer credit transactions secured by real property the rule requires certain disclosures to be provided to consumers in connection with applying for and closing on a mortgage loan the rule also mandates the use of specific disclosure forms timing of communicating information to borrowers and certain record keeping requirements the ongoing administrative burden and the system requirements associated with complying with these rules or potential changes to these rules could impact our mortgage volume and increase costs these arrangements with thirdparty mortgage originators and the fees payable by us to such third parties could also be subject to future regulatory scrutiny and restrictions the equal credit opportunity act the consumer protection act and the fair housing act prohibit discriminatory and other lending practices by lenders including financial institutions mortgage and consumer lending practices raise compliance risks resulting from the detailed and complex nature of mortgage and consumer lending laws and regulations imposed by federal regulatory agencies as well as the relatively independent and diverse operating channels in which loans are originated as we originate loans through various channels we and our thirdparty originators are especially impacted by these laws and regulations and are required to implement appropriate policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with fair lending laws and regulations and to avoid lending practices that result in the disparate treatment of or disparate impact to borrowers across our various locations under multiple channels failure to comply with these laws and regulations by us or our thirdparty originators could result in the bank being liable for damages to individual borrowers changes in business practices or other imposed penalties we are subject to various legal or regulatory investigations and proceedings at any given time we are involved with a number of legal and regulatory examinations as a part of reviews conducted by regulators and other parties which may involve banking securities consumer protection employment tort and numerous other laws and regulations proceedings or actions brought against us may result in judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions business improvement orders consent orders supervisory agreements restrictions on our business activities or other results adverse to us which could materially and negatively affect our business if such claims and other matters are not resolved in a manner favorable to us they may result in significant financial liability andor adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject may provide a private right of action that a consumer or class of consumers may pursue to enforce these laws and regulations we are currently subject to stockholder class and derivative actions which seek significant damages and other relief and may be subject to similar actions in the future any financial liability or reputational damage could have a materially adverse effect on our business and in turn on our financial condition and results of operations claims asserted against us can be highly complicated and slow to develop making the outcome of such proceedings difficult to predict or estimate early in the process as a participant in the financial services industry it is likely that we will be exposed to a high level of litigation and regulatory scrutiny relating to our business and operations although we establish accruals for legal or regulatory proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we do not have accruals for all legal or regulatory proceedings where we face a risk of loss due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal and regulatory proceedings in question as a result our ultimate losses may be significantly higher than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies for further information see note commitments and contingencies and item legal proceedings we may be required to pay interest on certain mortgage escrow accounts in accordance with certain state laws despite the federal preemption under the national bank act in the ninth circuit federal court of appeals held that california state law requiring mortgage servicers to pay interest on certain mortgage escrow accounts was not as a matter of law preempted by the national bank act lusnak v bank of america this ruling goes against the position that regulators national banks and other federallychartered financial institutions have taken regarding the preemption of statelaw mortgage escrow interest requirements the opinion issued by the ninth circuit federal court of appeals is legal precedent only in certain parts of the western united states we are defending similar litigation in california and are currently appealing a federal district court judgment against us in that case to the ninth circuit we are arguing that the lusnak case was wrongly decided we believe our situation can be distinguished from lusnak as a matter of law and californias interest on escrow law should be preempted as a matter of fact if the ninth circuits holding is more broadly adopted by other federal circuits including those covering states that currently have enacted or in the future may enact statutes requiring the payment of interest on escrow balances or if we would be required to retroactively credit interest on escrow funds the companys earnings could be adversely affected we could be exposed to fraud risks that affect our operations and reputation we face significant risks related to fraud which could result in financial loss expensive litigation and damage to our reputation our organization is exposed to various types of fraud including fraud or theft by colleagues or outsiders and unauthorized transactions we rely heavily on information provided by clients and third parties and misrepresentations in this information can lead to funding loans that do not meet our expectations or on unfavorable terms we bear the risk of loss associated with misrepresentations and it can be challenging to recover any monetary losses suffered we have implemented various controls and security measures but the failure of any of these controls could result in a failure to detect or mitigate fraud risks in a timely manner we are committed to ongoing investments and attention to combat fraud and enhance our security measures to protect against these risks reputational risk damage to our reputation could significantly harm the businesses we engage in as well as our competitive position and prospects for growth our ability to attract and retain investors customers clients and employees could be adversely affected by damage to our reputation resulting from various sources including employee misconduct litigation or regulatory outcomes failure to deliver minimum standards of service and quality compliance failures unintentional disproportionate assessment of fees to customers of protected classes unethical behavior unintended disclosure of confidential information and the activities of our clients customers andor counterparties actions by the financial services industry in general or by certain entities or individuals within it also could have a significantly adverse impact on our reputation our actual or perceived failure to identify and address various issues also could give rise to reputational risk that could significantly harm us and our business prospects including failure to properly address operational risks these issues include legal and regulatory requirements consumer protection fair lending and privacy issues properly maintaining customer and associated personal information record keeping protecting against money laundering sales and trading practices and ethical issues increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers regulators investors and other stakeholders with respect to our environmental social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks companies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers regulators investors and other stakeholders related to their environmental social and governance esg practices and disclosure investor advocacy groups investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices especially as they relate to the environment health and safety diversity labor conditions and human rights increased esgrelated compliance costs could result in increases to our overall operational costs failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation ability to do business with certain partners and our stock price new government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of esg oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting diligence and disclosure additionally concerns over the longterm impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts investors consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns the company and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as investor consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns the company and its customers may face cost increases asset value reductions and operating process changes among other impacts the impact on the companys customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities in addition the company would face reductions in credit worthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans investors could determine not to invest in the companys securities due to various climate change related considerations the companys efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions may not be effective in protecting the company from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in investor consumer or business behavior
