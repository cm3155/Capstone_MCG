item risk factors table end there are various risks and uncertainties that are inherent to our business primary among these are interest rate risk which arises from movements in interest rates credit risk which arises from an obligors failure to meet the terms of any contract with a bank or to otherwise perform as agreed risks related to our financial statements liquidity risk which arises from a banks inability to meet its obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses legalcompliance risk which arises from violations of or nonconformance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards market risk which arises from changes in the value of portfolios of financial instruments strategic risk which is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems operational risk which arises from problems with service or product delivery and reputational risk which arises from negative public opinion resulting in a significant decline in shareholder value following is a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and the value of our shares the failure to properly identify monitor and mitigate any of the below referenced risks could result in increased regulatory risk and could potentially have an adverse impact on the company additional risks that are not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations this report is qualified in its entirety by those risk factors covid19 related risk the widespread outbreak of covid19 has adversely affected and will likely continue to adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations moreover the longer the pandemic persists the more material the ultimate effects are likely to be the covid19 pandemic is negatively impacting economic activity the financial markets and commerce both globally and within the united states in our market area the governor of new york has issued an order that among other things required residents to stay in their homes and permitted them to leave only to conduct certain essential activities or to travel to work and close all nonessential businesses to the general public these stayathome orders and travel restrictions and similar orders imposed across the united states to restrict the spread of covid19 have resulted in significant business and operational disruptions including business closures supply chain disruptions and mass layoffs and furloughs although stayathome orders have been eased to phasedin reopening of businesses although capacity restrictions on movement and health and safety recommendations that encourage continued physical distancing and teleworking have limited the ability of businesses to return to prepandemic levels of activity the covid19 pandemic has negatively affected the companys business and is likely to continue to do so and the companys results of operations may be materially impacted if businesses remain closed for an extended period of time or unemployment remains at elevated levels for an extended period of time as an essential business we have implemented business continuity plans and continue to provide financial services to clients while taking health and safety measures such as transitioning most inperson customer transactions to our drivethru facilities and limiting access to the interior of our facilities frequent cleaning of our facilities and using a remote workforce where possible despite these safeguards we may nonetheless experience business disruptions and the rapid pace at which these issues are developing could overwhelm our ability to deal with them in a timely manner the continued spread of covid19 and the efforts to contain the virus could table start cause changes in consumer and business spending borrowing and saving habits which may affect the demand for loans and other products and services we offer as well as the credit worthiness of potential and current borrowers table end table start cause our borrowers to be unable to meet existing payment obligations particularly those borrowers that may be disproportionately affected by business shut downs and travel restrictions resulting in increases in loan delinquencies problem assets and foreclosures table end table start result in the lack of property transactions and asset sales table end table start cause the value of collateral for loans especially real estate to decline in value table end table start reduce the availability and productivity of our employees table end table start require us to

downgrade in our credit ratings table end table start prevent us from satisfying our minimum capital and other regulatory requirements table end table start impede our ability to close mortgage loans if appraisers and title companies are unable to perform their functions and table end table start cause the value of our securities portfolio to decline table end any one or a combination of the above events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations moreover our success and profitability is substantially dependent upon the management skills of our executive officers many of whom have held officer positions with us for many years the unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to covid19 could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy covid19 has caused a significant global economic downturn which has adversely effected and is expected to continue to adversely affect many business our business is dependent upon the ability and willingness of our customers to conduct banking and other financial transactions including the payment of their loan obligations specifically our multifamily and cre loans are dependent on the profitable operation and management of the property securing the loan if the impact of the pandemic is prolonged covid19 could have a significant adverse impact by reducing the revenue and cash flows of our borrowers impacting the borrowers ability to repay their loan increasing the risk of delinquencies and defaults and reducing the collateral value underlying the loans the covid19 pandemic has also led to an increase in the allowance for loan losses and in the allowance for unfunded commitments due to a change in forecasting potential losses and model assumptions under covid19 at december payment deferral programs totaled billion or of the total loan portfolio compared to billion or of the total loan portfolio at june despite the significant improvement between the second and fourth quarter of the pandemic may continue to have a material adverse impact on our loan portfolio particularly as businesses remain closed moreover the new york city metropolitan region has been disproportionately impacted by covid19 relative to other regions of the state and country accordingly the impact from covid19 on the company and our borrowers may be greater than on similar banks that do not have a similar geographic concentration interest rate risks changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and negatively impact the value of our loans securities and other assets this could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows financial condition results of operations and capital the cost of our deposits and shortterm wholesale borrowings is largely based on shortterm interest rates the level of which is driven by the fomc of the frb however the yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by intermediateterm interest rates which are set by the bond market and generally vary from day to day the level of our net interest income is therefore influenced by movements in such interest rates and the pace at which such movements occur if the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interestearning assets the result could be a reduction in net interest income and with it a reduction in our earnings our net interest income and earnings would be similarly impacted were the interest rates on our interestearning assets to decline more quickly than the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities in addition such changes in interest rates could affect our ability to originate loans and attract and retain deposits the fair values of our securities and other financial assets the fair values of our liabilities and the average lives of our loan and securities portfolios changes in interest rates also could have an effect on loan refinancing activity which in turn would impact the amount of prepayment income we receive on our multifamily and cre loans because prepayment income is recorded as interest income the extent to which it increases or decreases during any given period could have a significant impact on the level of net interest income and net income we generate during that time also changes in interest rates could have an effect on the slope of the yield curve if the yield curve were to invert or become flat our net interest income and net interest margin could contract adversely affecting our net income and cash flows and the value of our assets moreover higher inflation could lead to fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities and offbalance sheet exposures and could result in lower equity market valuations of financial services companies changes to and replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we have certain loans and leases securities wholesale borrowings derivative financial instruments and longterm debt whose interest rate is indexed to libor the fca which is responsible for regulating libor has announced that the publication of libor is not guaranteed beyond however during the fourth quarter of the fca has extended the timeline for the elimination of libor to june in order to avoid disruptions to the financial system uncertainty as to the adoption market acceptance or availability of sofr or other alternative reference rates may adversely affect the value of liborbased loans and securities in our portfolio and may impact the availability and cost of hedging instruments and borrowings the language in our liborbased contracts and financial instruments has developed over time and may have various events that trigger when a successor index to libor would be selected if a trigger is satisfied contracts and financial instruments may give us or the calculation agent as applicable discretion over the selection of the substitute index for the calculation of interest rates the implementation of a substitute index for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements may result in our incurring significant expenses in effecting the transition and may result in disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to libor of the substitute index any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations we continue to develop and implement plans to mitigate the risks associated with the expected discontinuation of libor in particular we have implemented or are in the process of implementing fallback language for liborlinked loans credit risks a decline in the quality of our assets could result in higher losses and the need to set aside higher loan loss provisions thus reducing our earnings and our stockholders equity the inability of our borrowers to repay their loans in accordance with their terms would likely necessitate an increase in our provision for credit losses and therefore reduce our earnings the loans we originate for investment are primarily multifamily loans cre loans and specialty finance loans and leases such loans are generally larger and have higher riskadjusted returns and shorter maturities than the other loans we produce for investment our credit risk would ordinarily be expected to increase with the growth of our multifamily and cre loan portfolios payments on multifamily and cre loans generally depend on the income generated by the underlying properties which in turn depends on their successful operation and management the ability of our borrowers to repay these loans may be impacted by adverse conditions in the local real estate market and the local economy while we seek to minimize these risks through our underwriting policies which generally require that such loans be qualified on the basis of the collateral propertys cash flows appraised value and debt service coverage ratio among other factors there can be no assurance that our underwriting policies will protect us from creditrelated losses or delinquencies to minimize the risks involved in our specialty finance lending and leasing we participate in syndicated loans that are brought to us and equipment loans and leases that are assigned to us by a select group of nationally recognized sources and generally are made to large corporate obligors many of which are publicly traded carry investment grade or nearinvestment grade ratings and participate in stable industries nationwide each of our credits is secured with a perfected first security interest in the underlying collateral and structured as senior debt or as a noncancelable lease we seek to minimize the risks involved in our other ci lending by underwriting such loans on the basis of the cash flows produced by the business by requiring that such loans be collateralized by various business assets including inventory equipment and accounts receivable among others and by requiring personal guarantees however the capacity of a borrower to repay such a ci loan is substantially dependent on the degree to which his or her business is successful in addition the collateral underlying other ci loans may depreciate over time may not be conducive to appraisal or may fluctuate in value based upon the results of operations of the business we also originate adc loans although to a far lesser degree than we originate multifamily and cre loans adc financing typically involves a greater degree of credit risk than longerterm financing on multifamily and cre properties risk of loss on an adc loan largely depends upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the propertys value at completion of construction or development compared to the estimated costs including interest of construction if the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate the loan may be undersecured while we seek to minimize these risks by maintaining consistent lending policies and procedures and rigorous underwriting standards an error in such estimates among other factors could have a material adverse effect on the quality of our adc loan portfolio thereby resulting in losses or delinquencies the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans could be adversely impacted by a decline in real estate values andor an increase in unemployment which not only could result in our experiencing losses but also could necessitate our recording a provision for credit losses either of these events would have an adverse impact on our net income although losses on the loans we produce have been comparatively limited even during periods of economic weakness in our markets we cannot guarantee that this will be our experience in future periods in addition to loan losses due to borrowers inability to repay their loans downgrades in our internal loan classifications may result in a higher provision for credit losses and the acl a higher level of net chargeoffs andor higher noninterest expenses our allowance for credit losses might not be sufficient to cover our actual losses which would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in addition to mitigating credit risk through our underwriting processes we attempt to mitigate such risk through the establishment of an allowance for credit losses the process of determining whether or not the allowance is sufficient to cover potential credit losses is based on the current expected credit loss model or cecl this methodology is described in detail under critical accounting policies in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report cecl may result in greater volatility in the level of the acl depending on various assumptions and factors used in this model if the judgments and assumptions we make with regard to the allowance are incorrect our allowance for losses on such loans might not be sufficient and an additional provision for credit losses might need to be made depending on the amount of such loan loss provisions the adverse impact on our earnings could be material in addition growth in our loan portfolio may require us to increase the allowance for credit losses on such loans by making additional provisions which would reduce our net income furthermore bank regulators have the authority to require us to make provisions for credit losses or otherwise recognize loan chargeoffs following their periodic review of our loan portfolio our underwriting procedures and our allowance for losses on such loans any increase in the loan loss allowance or in loan chargeoffs as required by such regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our concentration in multifamily loans and cre loans could expose us to increased lending risks and related loan losses our current business strategy is to continue to originate multifamily loans and to a lesser extent cre loans at december billion or of our total loans and leases held for investment portfolio consisted of multifamily loans and billion or consisted of cre loans these types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of nonpayment and loss than onetofour family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the properties and the sale of such properties securing the loans such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to onetofour family residential loans also many of our borrowers have more than one of these types of loans outstanding consequentially an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a onetofour family residential real estate loan in addition if loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition our new york state multifamily loan portfolio could be adversely impacted by changes in legislation or regulation which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on june the new york state legislature passed the new york housing stability and tenant protection act of this legislation represents the most extensive reform of new york states rent laws in several decades and generally limits a landlords ability to increase rents on rent regulated apartments and makes it more difficult to convert rent regulated apartments to market rate apartments as a result the value of the collateral located in new york state securing the companys multifamily loans or the future net operating income of such properties could potentially become impaired which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations economic weakness in the new york city metropolitan region where the majority of the properties collateralizing our multifamily cre and adc loans and the majority of the businesses collateralizing our other ci loans are located could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations our business depends significantly on general economic conditions in the new york city metropolitan region where the majority of the buildings and properties securing the multifamily cre and adc loans we originate for investment and the businesses of the customers to whom we make our other ci loans are located accordingly the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the collateral securing such loans may be significantly affected by economic conditions in this region including changes in the local real estate market a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation recession unemployment acts of terrorism extreme weather or other factors beyond our control could therefore have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition because multifamily and cre loans represent the majority of the loans in our portfolio a decline in tenant occupancy or rents due to such factors or for other reasons such as new legislation could adversely impact the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans on a timely basis which could have a negative impact on our net income furthermore economic or market turmoil could occur in the near or long term this could negatively affect our business our financial condition and our results of operations as well as our ability to maintain or increase the level of cash dividends we currently pay to our shareholders the company has granted payment deferrals to borrowers that have experienced financial hardship due to covid19 and if those borrowers are unable to resume making payments the company will experience an increase in nonaccrual loans which could adversely affect the companys earnings and financial condition consistent with the public encouragement provided generally by federal and state financial institution regulators after the spread of covid19 in the united states the company has attempted to work constructively with borrowers who have experienced financial hardship as a result of the pandemic to negotiate accommodations or forbearance arrangements that temporarily reduce or defer the monthly payments due to the company generally these accommodations are for six months and allow customers to temporarily cease making principal andor interest payments in some cases customers have received a second accommodation through december the company had granted accommodations with a total value of billion and as of december billion of loans remained subject to a payment accommodation upon the expiration of the deferral period in which case their loans will be classified as nonaccrual and the company will begin collection activities npls and related chargeoffs may increase significantly in as payment wanes an increase in npls and chargeoffs would cause the company to increase its allowance for credit losses which would adversely affect the companys earnings and financial condition customary means to collect nonperforming assets may be prohibited or impractical during the covid19 pandemic and there is a risk that collateral securing a nonperforming asset may deteriorate if the company chooses not to or is unable to foreclose on a timely basis governments in the areas in which the company conducts its lending services have adopted or may adopt in the future regulations or promulgate executive orders that restrict or limit our ability to take certain actions with respect to delinquent borrowers that we would otherwise take in the ordinary course of business such as customary collection and foreclosure procedures executive orders that have been imposed restrict the ability of financial institutions to undertake residential and commercial foreclosures and evictions there is a risk that the value of the collateral securing a nonaccrual loan may deteriorate if the company chooses not to or is unable to foreclose on the collateral on a timely basis risks related to our financial statements changes in accounting standards or interpretation of new or existing standards may affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations from time to time the fasb and the sec change accounting regulations and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements in addition the fasb sec bank regulators and the outside independent auditors may revise their previous interpretations regarding existing accounting regulations and the application of these accounting standards these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how to record and report our financial condition and results of operations in some cases there could be a requirement to apply a new or revised accounting standard retroactively resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements the implementation of a new accounting standard could require us to increase our allowance for credit losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in june the fasb issued asu no financial instrumentscredit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments asu no replaces the incurred loss model with an expected loss model which is referred to as the current expected credit loss model or cecl asu no became effective for us on january this standard required earlier recognition of expected credit losses on loans and certain other instruments compared to the incurred loss model the change to the cecl framework requires us to greatly increase the data we must collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses the adoption of cecl may result in greater volatility in the level of the allowance for credit losses depending on various factors and assumptions applied in the model such as the forecasted economic conditions in the foreseeable future and loan payment behaviors any increase in the allowance for credit losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models the processes we use to estimate expected losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models these models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances even if these assumptions are adequate the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation if the models that we use for interest rate risk and assetliability management are inadequate we may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures if the models that we use for determining our expected losses are inadequate the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future chargeoffs if the models that we use to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what we could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments any such failure in our analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations impairment in the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations at december goodwill and other intangible assets totaled billion goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable a significant decline in expected future cash flows a material change in interest rates a significant adverse change in the business climate slower growth rates or a significant or sustained decline in the price of our common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets the amount of any impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations liquidity risks failure to maintain an adequate level of liquidity could result in an inability to fulfill our financial obligations and also could subject us to material reputational and compliance risk our primary sources of liquidity are the retail and institutional deposits we gather or acquire in connection with acquisitions and the brokered deposits we accept borrowed funds primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings from the fhlbny and various wall street brokerage firms cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans and cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities in addition and depending on current market conditions we have the ability to access the capital markets from time to time to generate additional liquidity deposit flows calls of investment securities and wholesale borrowings and the prepayment of loans and mortgagerelated securities are strongly influenced by such external factors as the direction of interest rates whether actual or perceived local and national economic conditions and competition for deposits and loans in the markets we serve the withdrawal of more deposits than we anticipate could have an adverse impact on our profitability as this source of funding if not replaced by similar deposit funding would need to be replaced with wholesale funding the sale of interestearning assets or a combination of the two the replacement of deposit funding with wholesale funding could cause our overall cost of funds to increase which would reduce our net interest income and results of operations a decline in interestearning assets would also lower our net interest income and results of operations in addition largescale withdrawals of brokered or institutional deposits could require us to pay significantly higher interest rates on our retail deposits or on other wholesale funding sources which would have an adverse impact on our net interest income and net income furthermore changes to the fhlbnys underwriting guidelines for wholesale borrowings or lending policies may limit or restrict our ability to borrow and therefore could have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity a decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans invest in securities and meet our expenses or to fulfill such obligations as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands a downgrade of the credit ratings of the company and the bank could also adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital and could significantly increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or to purchase our securities this could affect our growth profitability and financial condition including our liquidity if we were to defer payments on our trust preferred capital debt securities or were in default under the related indentures we would be prohibited from paying dividends or distributions on our common stock the terms of our outstanding trust preferred capital debt securities prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock including our common stock or purchasing acquiring or making a liquidation payment on such stock under the following circumstances a if an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the applicable indenture b if we are in default with respect to a payment under the guarantee of the related trust preferred securities or c if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing in addition without notice to or consent from the holders of our common stock we may issue additional series of trust preferred capital debt securities with similar terms or enter into other financing agreements that limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock dividends on the series a preferred stock are discretionary and noncumulative and may not be paid if such payment will result in our failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations dividends on the series a preferred stock are discretionary and noncumulative if our board of directors or any duly authorized committee of the board does not authorize and declare a dividend on the series a preferred stock for any dividend period holders of the depositary shares will not be entitled to receive any dividend for that dividend period and the unpaid dividend will cease to accrue and be payable we have no obligation to pay dividends accrued for a dividend period after the dividend payment date for that period if our board of directors or any duly authorized committee thereof has not declared a dividend before the related dividend payment date whether or not dividends on the series a preferred stock or any other series of our preferred stock or our common stock are declared for any future dividend period additionally under the frbs capital rules dividends on the series a preferred stock may only be paid out of our net income retained earnings or surplus related to other additional tier capital instruments if the nonpayment of dividends on series a preferred stock for any dividend period would cause the company to fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation or any agreement we may enter into with our regulators from time to time then we would not be able to declare or pay a dividend for such dividend period in such a case holders of the depositary shares will not be entitled to receive any dividend for that dividend period and the unpaid dividend will cease to accrue and be payable legalcompliance risks inability to fulfill minimum capital requirements could limit our ability to conduct or expand our business pay a dividend or result in termination of our fdic deposit insurance and thus impact our financial condition our results of operations and the market value of our stock we are subject to the comprehensive consolidated supervision and regulation set forth by the frb such regulation includes among other matters the level of leverage and riskbased capital ratios we are required to maintain depending on general economic conditions changes in our capital position could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and risk profile and also could limit our ability to grow through acquisitions or otherwise compliance with regulatory capital requirements may limit our ability to engage in operations that require the intensive use of capital and therefore could adversely affect our ability to maintain our current level of business or expand furthermore it is possible that future regulatory changes could result in more stringent capital or liquidity requirements including increases in the levels of regulatory capital we are required to maintain and changes in the way capital or liquidity is measured for regulatory purposes either of which could adversely affect our business and our ability to expand for example federal banking regulations adopted under basel iii standards require bank holding companies and banks to undertake significant activities to demonstrate compliance with higher capital requirements any additional requirements to increase our capital ratios or liquidity could necessitate our liquidating certain assets perhaps on terms that are unfavorable to us or that are contrary to our business plans in addition such requirements could also compel us to issue additional securities thus diluting the value of our common stock in addition failure to meet established capital requirements could result in the frb placing limitations or conditions on our activities and further restricting the commencement of new activities the failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities including limiting our ability to pay dividends issuing a directive to increase our capital and terminating our fdic deposit insurance our results of operations could be materially affected by further changes in bank regulation or by our ability to comply with certain existing laws rules and regulations governing our industry we are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the following entities the nysdfs the fdic the frbny and the cfpb which was established in under the doddfrank act and given broad authority to regulate financial service providers and financial products such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank holding company and its banking subsidiaries may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the dif the banking system in general and bank customers rather than for the benefit of a companys stockholders these regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities including with respect to the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank or a bank holding company the imposition of significant fines the ability to delay or deny merger or other regulatory applications the classification of assets by a bank and the adequacy of a banks allowance for loan losses among other matters changes in such regulation and supervision or changes in regulation or enforcement by such authorities whether in the form of policy regulations legislation rules orders enforcement actions ratings or decisions could have a material impact on the company our subsidiary bank and other affiliates and our operations in addition failure of the company or the bank to comply with such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and capital see regulation and supervision in part i item business earlier in this filing for a detailed description of the federal state and local regulations to which the company and the bank are subject our enterprise risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating the risks to which we are subject based upon the size scope and complexity of the company as a financial institution we are subject to a number of risks including interest rate credit liquidity legalcompliance market strategic operational and reputational our erm framework is designed to minimize the risks to which we are subject as well as any losses stemming from such risks although we seek to identify measure monitor report and control our exposure to such risks and employ a broad and diverse set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques in the process those techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or development of risks that are currently unknown and unanticipated for example economic and market conditions heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry and increases in the overall complexity of our operations among other developments have resulted in the creation of a variety of risks that were previously unknown and unanticipated highlighting the intrinsic limitations of our risk monitoring and mitigation techniques as a result the further development of previously unknown or unanticipated risks may result in our incurring losses in the future that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations furthermore an ineffective erm framework as well as other risk factors could result in a material increase in our fdic insurance premiums if federal state or local tax authorities were to determine that we did not adequately provide for our taxes our income tax expense could be increased adversely affecting our earnings the amount of income taxes we are required to pay on our earnings is based on federal state and local legislation and regulations we provide for current and deferred taxes in our financial statements based on our results of operations business activity legal structure interpretation of tax statutes assessment of risk of adjustment upon audit and application of financial accounting standards we may take tax return filing positions for which the final determination of tax is uncertain and our net income and earnings per share could be reduced if a federal state or local authority were to assess additional taxes that have not been provided for in our consolidated financial statements in addition there can be no assurance that we will achieve our anticipated effective tax rate unanticipated changes in tax laws or related regulatory or judicial guidance or an audit assessment that denies previously recognized tax benefits could result in our recording tax expenses that materially reduce our net income market risks a decline in economic conditions could adversely affect the value of the loans we originate and the securities in which we invest declines in real estate values and home sales and an increase in the financial stress on borrowers stemming from high unemployment or other adverse economic conditions could negatively affect our borrowers and in turn the repayment of the loans in our portfolio deterioration in economic conditions also could subject us and our industry to increased regulatory scrutiny and could result in an increase in loan delinquencies an increase in problem assets and foreclosures and a decline in the value of the collateral for our loans which could reduce our customers borrowing power deterioration in local economic conditions could drive the level of loan losses beyond the level we have provided for in our loan loss allowance this in turn could necessitate an increase in our provisions for loan losses which would reduce our earnings and capital furthermore declines in the value of our investment securities could result in our having to record losses based on the otherthantemporary impairment of securities which would reduce our earnings and also could reduce our capital in addition continued economic weakness could reduce the demand for our products and services which would adversely impact our liquidity and the revenues we produce the market price and liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if the economy were to weaken or the capital markets were to experience volatility the market price of our common stock could be subject to

in the near or long term which could negatively affect our business our financial condition and our results of operations as well as volatility in the price and trading volume of our common stock strategic risks extensive competition for loans and deposits could adversely affect our ability to expand our business as well as our financial condition and results of operations because our profitability stems from our ability to attract deposits and originate loans our continued ability to compete for depositors and borrowers is critical to our success our success as a competitor depends on a number of factors including our ability to develop maintain and build longterm relationships with our customers by providing them with convenience in the form of multiple branch locations extended hours of service and access through alternative delivery channels a broad and diverse selection of products and services interest rates and service fees that compare favorably with those of our competitors and skilled and knowledgeable personnel to assist our customers by addressing their financial needs external factors that may impact our ability to compete include among others the entry of new lenders and depository institutions in our current markets and with regard to lending an increased focus on multifamily and cre lending by existing competitors limitations on our ability to grow our portfolios of multifamily and cre loans could adversely affect our ability to generate interest income as well our financial condition and results of operations perhaps materially although we also originate ci and adc loans and invest in securities our portfolios of multifamily and cre loans represent the largest portion of our asset mix of total loans held for investment as of december our leadership position in these markets has been instrumental to our production of solid earnings and our consistent record of exceptional asset quality we monitor the ratio of our multifamily cre and adc loans as defined in the cre guidance to our total riskbased capital to ensure that we are in compliance with regulatory guidance any inability to grow our multifamily and cre loan portfolios could negatively impact our ability to grow our earnings per share the inability to engage in merger transactions or to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions in which we might engage could adversely affect our ability to compete with other financial institutions and weaken our financial performance our ability to engage in future mergers and acquisitions would depend on our ability to identify suitable merger partners and acquisition opportunities our ability to finance and complete negotiated transactions at acceptable prices and on acceptable terms and our ability to obtain the necessary shareholder and regulatory approvals if we are unable to engage in or complete a desired acquisition or merger transaction our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted as acquisitions have been a significant source of deposits the inability to complete a business combination could require that we increase the interest rates we pay on deposits in order to attract such funding through our current branch network or that we increase our use of wholesale funds increasing our cost of funds could adversely impact our net interest income and our net income furthermore the absence of acquisitions could impact our ability to fulfill our loan demand in addition mergers and acquisitions can lead to uncertainties about the future on the part of customers and employees such uncertainties could cause customers and others to consider changing their existing business relationships with the company to be acquired and could cause its employees to accept positions with other companies before the merger occurs as a result the ability of a company to attract and retain customers and to attract retain and motivate key personnel prior to a mergers completion could be impaired furthermore no assurance can be given that acquired operations would not adversely affect our existing profitability that we would be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by our existing banking business that we would be able to compete effectively in the market areas served by acquired branches or that we would be able to manage any growth resulting from a transaction effectively in particular our ability to compete effectively in new markets would be dependent on our ability to understand those markets and their competitive dynamics and our ability to retain certain key employees from the acquired institution who know those markets better than we do the inability to receive dividends from our subsidiary bank could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations as well as our ability to maintain or increase the current level of cash dividends we pay to our shareholders the parent company ie the company on an unconsolidated basis is a separate and distinct legal entity from the bank and a substantial portion of the revenues the parent company receives consists of dividends from the bank these dividends are the primary funding source for the dividends we pay on our common stock and the interest and principal payments on our debt various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that a bank may pay to its parent company in addition our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary may be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors if the bank is unable to pay dividends to the parent company we might not be able to service our debt pay our obligations or pay dividends on our common stock reduction or elimination of our quarterly cash dividend could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds available for such payments under applicable law and regulatory guidance and although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so furthermore the payment of dividends falls under federal regulations that have grown more stringent in recent years while we pay our quarterly cash dividend in compliance with current regulations such regulations could change in the future any reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock operational risks our stress testing processes rely on analytical and forecasting models that may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate which could adversely affect the effectiveness of our strategic planning and our ability to pursue certain corporate goals the processes we use to estimate the effects of changing interest rates real estate values and economic indicators such as unemployment on our financial condition and results of operations depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models these models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances furthermore even if our assumptions are accurate predictors of future performance the models they are based on may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or implementation if the models we use in the process of managing our interest rate and other risks prove to be inadequate or inaccurate we could incur increased or unexpected losses which in turn could adversely affect our earnings and capital additionally failure by the company to maintain compliance with strict capital liquidity and other stress test requirements under banking regulations could subject us to regulatory sanctions including limitations on our ability to pay dividends the occurrence of any failure breach or interruption in service involving our systems or those of our service providers could damage our reputation cause losses increase our expenses and result in a loss of customers an increase in regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possibly financial liability any of which could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our stock communication and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business as we use such systems and those maintained and provided to us by third party service providers to manage our customer relationships our general ledger our deposits and our loans in addition our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant the security of our computer systems software and networks may be vulnerable to breaches unauthorized access misuse computer viruses or other malicious code and cyberattacks that could have an impact on information security with the rise and permeation of online and mobile banking the financial services industry in particular faces substantial cybersecurity risk due to the type of sensitive information provided by customers our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers and customers are under constant threat and it is possible that we or they could experience a significant event in the future that could adversely affect our business or operations in addition breaches of security may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having authorized or unauthorized access to our confidential or other information or that of our customers clients or counterparties if one or more of such events were to occur the confidential and other information processed and stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks could potentially be jeopardized or could otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers clients or counterparties this could cause us significant reputational damage or result in our experiencing significant losses while we diligently assess applicable regulatory and legislative developments affecting our business laws and regulations relating to cybersecurity have been frequently changing imposing new requirements on us in light of these conditions we face the potential for additional regulatory scrutiny that will lead to increasing compliance and technology expenses and in some cases possible limitations on the achievement of our plans for growth and other strategic objectives furthermore we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks additional expenditures may be required for thirdparty expert consultants or outside counsel we also may be subject to litigation and financial losses that either are not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance we maintain in addition we routinely transmit and receive personal confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means we have discussed and worked with our customers clients and counterparties to develop secure transmission capabilities but we do not have and may be unable to put in place secure capabilities with all of these constituents and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information we maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure we will timely and sufficiently notify our investors of material cybersecurity risks and incidents including the associated financial legal or reputational consequence of such an event as well as reviewing and updating any prior disclosures relating to the risk or event while we have established information security policies and procedures including an incident response plan to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures and interruptions we may not be able to anticipate all possible security breaches that could affect our systems or information and there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or will be adequately prevented or mitigated if they do the company and the bank rely on third parties to perform certain key business functions which may expose us to further operational risk we outsource certain key aspects of our data processing to certain thirdparty providers while we have selected these thirdparty providers carefully we cannot control their actions our ability to deliver products and services to our customers to adequately process and account for our customers transactions or otherwise conduct our business could be adversely impacted by any disruption in the services provided by these third parties their failure to handle current or higher volumes of usage or any difficulties we may encounter in communicating with them replacing these thirdparty providers also could entail significant delay and expense our thirdparty providers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses phishing schemes and other security breaches threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other thirdparty providers and their personnel we may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches and computer viruses or to alleviate problems caused by such security breaches or viruses to the extent that the activities of our thirdparty providers or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims regulatory scrutiny litigation and other possible liabilities in addition the company may not be adequately insured against all types of losses resulting from thirdparty failures and our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from systems failures or other disruptions to our banking services failure to keep pace with technological changes could have a material adverse impact on our ability to compete for loans and deposits and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations financial products and services have become increasingly technologydriven to some degree our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively and in a costefficient manner is dependent on our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technologydriven products and services the inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely impact our operations to a large degree our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel whose expertise knowledge of our markets and years of industry experience would make them difficult to replace competition for skilled leaders in our industry can be intense and we may not be able to hire or retain the people we would like to have working for us the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business given the specialized knowledge of such personnel and the difficulty of finding qualified replacements on a timely basis furthermore our ability to attract and retain personnel with the skills and knowledge to support our business may require that we offer additional compensation and benefits that would reduce our earnings many aspects of our operations are dependent upon the soundness of other financial intermediaries and thus could expose us to systemic risk the soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of relationships between them involving credit trading execution of transactions and the like as a result concerns about or a default or threatened default by one institution could lead to significant marketwide liquidity and credit problems losses or defaults by other institutions as such systemic risk may adversely affect the financial intermediaries with which we interact on a daily basis such as clearing agencies clearing houses banks and securities firms and exchanges we could be adversely impacted as well noncompliance with the bank secrecy act and other antimoney laundering statutes and regulations could result in material financial loss the bsa and the usa patriot act contain antimoney laundering and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the us financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities the bsa as amended by the usa patriot act requires depository institutions to undertake activities including monitoring an antimoney laundering program verifying the identity of clients monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions reporting on cash transactions above a certain threshold and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies fincen a unit of the us treasury department that administers the bsa is authorized to impose significant civil monetary penalties for violations of these requirements failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing activities could also result in reputational risk for the company failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanesoxley act of could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price as a public company we are required to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanesoxley act of internal control over financial reporting is complex and may be revised over time to adapt to changes in our business or changes in applicable accounting rules we cannot assure you that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in the future or that a material weakness will not be discovered with respect to a prior period for which we had previously believed that our internal control over financial reporting was effective if we are not able to maintain or document effective internal control over financial reporting our independent registered public accounting firm will not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting matters impacting our internal control over financial reporting may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis or may cause us to restate previously issued financial information and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences including sanctions or investigations by the sec or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules there could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements confidence in the reliability of our financial statements is also likely to suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm reports a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting this could materially adversely affect us by for example leading to a decline in our stock price and impairing our ability to raise capital reputational risk damage to our reputation could significantly harm the businesses we engage in as well as our competitive position and prospects for growth our ability to attract and retain investors customers clients and employees could be adversely affected by damage to our reputation resulting from various sources including employee misconduct litigation or regulatory outcomes failure to deliver minimum standards of service and quality compliance failures unethical behavior unintended disclosure of confidential information and the activities of our clients customers andor counterparties actions by the financial services industry in general or by certain entities or individuals within it also could have a significantly adverse impact on our reputation our actual or perceived failure to identify and address various issues also could give rise to reputational risk that could significantly harm us and our business prospects including failure to properly address operational risks these issues include legal and regulatory requirements consumer protection fair lending and privacy issues properly maintaining customer and associated personal information record keeping protecting against money laundering sales and trading practices and ethical issues societal responses to climate change could adversely affect the companys business and performance including in directly through impacts on the companys investors and customers concerns over the longterm impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts investors consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns the company and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as investor consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns the company and its customers may face cost increases asset value reductions and operating process changes among other impacts the impact on the companys customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities in addition the company would face reductions in credit worthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans investors could determine not to invest in the companys securities due to various climate change related considerations the companys efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions may not be effective in protecting the company from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in investor consumer or business behavior recent events declaration of dividend
