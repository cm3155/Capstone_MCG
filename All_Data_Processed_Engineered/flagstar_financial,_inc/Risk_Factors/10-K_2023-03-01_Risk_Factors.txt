item ri sk factors there are various risks and uncertainties that are inherent to our business primary among these are interest rate risk which arises from movements in interest rates credit risk which arises from an obligors failure to meet the terms of any contract with a bank or to otherwise perform as agreed risks related to our financial statements liquidity risk which arises from a banks inability to meet its obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses legalcompliance risk which arises from violations of or nonconformance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards market risk which arises from changes in the value of portfolios of financial instruments strategic risk which is the risk of loss arising from the execution of our strategic initiatives and business strategies including our acquisition and integration of other companies we acquire as well as inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems operational risk which arises from problems with service or product delivery and reputational risk which arises from negative public opinion resulting in a significant decline in stockholder value following is a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and the value of our shares the failure to properly identify monitor and mitigate any of the below referenced risks could result in increased regulatory risk and could potentially have an adverse impact on the company additional risks that are not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations this report is qualified in its entirety by those risk factors interest rate risks changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and negatively impact the value of our loans securities and other assets this could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows financial condition results of operations and capital the cost of our deposits and shortterm wholesale borrowings is largely based on shortterm interest rates the level of which is driven by the fomc of the frb however the yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by intermediateterm interest rates which are set by the bond market and generally vary from day to day the level of our net interest income is therefore influenced by movements in such interest rates and the pace at which such movements occur if the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interestearning assets the result could be a reduction in net interest income and with it a reduction in our earnings our net interest income and earnings would be similarly impacted were the interest rates on our interestearning assets to decline more quickly than the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities in addition such changes in interest rates could affect our ability to originate loans and attract and retain deposits the fair values of our securities and other financial assets the fair values of our liabilities and the average lives of our loan and securities portfolios changes in interest rates also could have an effect on loan refinancing activity which in turn would impact the amount of prepayment income we receive on our multifamily and cre loans because prepayment income is recorded as interest income the extent to which it increases or decreases during any given period could have a significant impact on the level of net interest income and net income we generate during that time also changes in interest rates could have an effect on the slope of the yield curve if the yield curve were to invert or become flat our net interest income and net interest margin could contract adversely affecting our net income and cash flows and the value of our assets moreover higher inflation could lead to fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities and offbalance sheet exposures and could result in lower equity market valuations of financial services companies changes to and replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the company has certain loans interest rate swap agreements investment securities and debt obligations whose interest rate is indexed to libor in the fca which is responsible for regulating libor announced that the publication of libor is not guaranteed beyond in december the administrator of libor announced its intention to i cease the publication of the oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor after december and ii cease the publication of all other tenors of us dollar libor one three six and 12month libor after june and on march announced that it will permanently cease to publish most libor settings beginning on january and cease to publish the overnight onemonth threemonth sixmonth and 12month us dollar libor settings on july accordingly the fca has stated that it does not intend to persuade or compel banks to submit to libor after such respective dates until such time however fca panel banks have agreed to continue to support libor in october the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a joint statement on managing the libor transition that offered their regulatory expectations and outlined potential supervisory and enforcement consequences for banks that fail to adequately plan for and implement the transition away from libor the failure to properly transition away from libor may result in increased supervisory scrutiny the implementation of a substitute index for the calculation of interest rates under the companys loan agreements may result in disputes or litigation with counterparties over the appropriateness or comparability to libor of the substitute index which would have an adverse effect on the companys results of operations even when robust fallback language is included there can be no assurances that the replacement rate plus any spread adjustment will be economically equivalent to libor which could result in a lower interest rate being paid to the company on such assets the alternative reference rates committee a group of privatemarket participants convened by the frb and the frbny has identified sofr as the recommended alternative to libor the use of sofr as a substitute for libor is voluntary and may not be suitable for all market participants sofr is calculated and observed differently than libor given the manner in which sofr is calculated it is likely to be lower than libor and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions market practices related to sofr calculation conventions continue to develop and may vary inconsistent calculation conventions among financial products may expose is to increased basic rate and resultant costs other alternatives to libor also exist but because of the difference in how those alternatives are constructed they may diverge significantly from libor in a range of situations and market conditions credit risk our allowance for credit losses might not be sufficient to cover our actual losses which would adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in addition to mitigating credit risk through our underwriting processes we attempt to mitigate such risk through the establishment of an allowance for credit losses the process of determining whether or not the allowance is sufficient to cover potential credit losses is based on the current expected credit loss model or cecl this methodology is described in detail under critical accounting estimates in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report cecl may result in greater volatility in the level of the acl depending on various assumptions and factors used in this model if the judgments and assumptions we make with regard to the allowance are incorrect our allowance for losses on such loans might not be sufficient and an additional provision for credit losses might need to be made depending on the amount of such loan loss provisions the adverse impact on our earnings could be material in addition growth in our loan portfolio may require us to increase the allowance for credit losses on such loans by making additional provisions which would reduce our net income furthermore bank regulators have the authority to require us to make provisions for credit losses or otherwise recognize loan chargeoffs following their periodic review of our loan portfolio our underwriting procedures and our allowance for losses on such loans any increase in the loan loss allowance or in loan chargeoffs as required by such regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our concentration in multifamily loans and cre loans could expose us to increased lending risks and related loan losses at december billion or percent of our total loans and leases held for investment portfolio consisted of multifamily loans and billion or percent consisted of cre loans these types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of nonpayment and loss than onetofour family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the properties and the sale of such properties securing the loans such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to onetofour family residential loans also many of our borrowers have more than one of these types of loans outstanding consequently an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a onetofour family residential real estate loan in addition if loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition our new york state multifamily loan portfolio could be adversely impacted by changes in legislation or regulation which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on june the new york state legislature passed the new york housing stability and tenant protection act of this legislation represents the most extensive reform of new york states rent laws in several decades and generally limits a landlords ability to increase rents on rent regulated apartments and makes it more difficult to convert rent regulated apartments to market rate apartments as a result the value of the collateral located in new york state securing the companys multifamily loans or the future net operating income of such properties could potentially become impaired which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations to date the company has not experienced any material negative impacts as a result of this legislation economic weakness in the new york city metropolitan region where the majority of the properties collateralizing our multifamily cre and adc loans and the majority of the businesses collateralizing our other ci loans are located could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations our business depends significantly on general economic conditions in the new york city metropolitan region where the majority of the buildings and properties securing the multifamily cre and adc loans we originate for investment and the businesses of the customers to whom we make our other ci loans are located accordingly the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the collateral securing such loans may be significantly affected by economic conditions in this region including changes in the local real estate market a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation recession unemployment acts of terrorism extreme weather or other factors beyond our control could therefore have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition because multifamily and cre loans represent the majority of the loans in our portfolio a decline in tenant occupancy or rents due to such factors or for other reasons such as new legislation could adversely impact the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans on a timely basis which could have a negative impact on our net income furthermore economic or market turmoil could occur in the near or long term this could negatively affect our business our financial condition and our results of operations as well as our ability to maintain or increase the level of cash dividends we currently pay to our stockholders financial statements risk our accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models the processes we use to estimate expected losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models these models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances even if these assumptions are adequate the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation if the models that we use for interest rate risk and assetliability management are inadequate we may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures if the models that we use for determining our expected losses are inadequate the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future chargeoffs if the models that we use to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what we could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments any such failure in our analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations impairment in the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations at december goodwill and other intangible assets totaled billion goodwill and our other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable a significant decline in expected future cash flows a material change in interest rates a significant adverse change in the business climate slower growth rates or a significant or sustained decline in the price of our common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets the amount of any impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations liquidity risks failure to maintain an adequate level of liquidity could result in an inability to fulfill our financial obligations and also could subject us to material reputational and compliance risk our primary sources of liquidity are the retail and institutional deposits we gather or acquire in connection with acquisitions and the brokered deposits we accept borrowed funds primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings from the fhlbny and various wall street brokerage firms cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans and cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities in addition and depending on current market conditions we have the ability to access the capital markets from time to time to generate additional liquidity deposit flows calls of investment securities and wholesale borrowings and the prepayment of loans and mortgagerelated securities are strongly influenced by such external factors as the direction of interest rates whether actual or perceived local and national economic conditions and competition for deposits and loans in the markets we serve the withdrawal of more deposits than we anticipate could have an adverse impact on our profitability as this source of funding if not replaced by similar deposit funding would need to be replaced with wholesale funding the sale of interestearning assets or a combination of the two the replacement of deposit funding with wholesale funding could cause our overall cost of funds to increase which would reduce our net interest income and results of operations a decline in interestearning assets would also lower our net interest income and results of operations in addition largescale withdrawals of brokered or institutional deposits could require us to pay significantly higher interest rates on our retail deposits or on other wholesale funding sources which would have an adverse impact on our net interest income and net income furthermore changes to the fhlbnys underwriting guidelines for wholesale borrowings or lending policies may limit or restrict our ability to borrow and therefore could have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity a decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans invest in securities and meet our expenses or to fulfill such obligations as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands a downgrade of the credit ratings of the company and the bank could also adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital and could significantly increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or to purchase our securities this could affect our growth profitability and financial condition including our liquidity if we were to defer payments on our trust preferred capital debt securities or were in default under the related indentures we would be prohibited from paying dividends or distributions on our common stock the terms of our outstanding trust preferred capital debt securities prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock including our common stock or purchasing acquiring or making a liquidation payment on such stock under the following circumstances a if an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the applicable indenture b if we are in default with respect to a payment under the guarantee of the related trust preferred securities or c if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing in addition without notice to or consent from the holders of our common stock we may issue additional series of trust preferred capital debt securities with similar terms or enter into other financing agreements that limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock dividends on the series a preferred stock are discretionary and noncumulative and may not be paid if such payment will result in our failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations dividends on the series a preferred stock are discretionary and noncumulative if our board of directors or any duly authorized committee of the board does not authorize and declare a dividend on the series a preferred stock for any dividend period holders of the depositary shares will not be entitled to receive any dividend for that dividend period and the unpaid dividend will cease to accrue and be payable we have no obligation to pay dividends accrued for a dividend period after the dividend payment date for that period if our board of directors or any duly authorized committee thereof has not declared a dividend before the related dividend payment date whether or not dividends on the series a preferred stock or any other series of our preferred stock or our common stock are declared for any future dividend period additionally under the frbs capital rules dividends on the series a preferred stock may only be paid out of our net income retained earnings or surplus related to other additional tier capital instruments if the nonpayment of dividends on series a preferred stock for any dividend period would cause the company to fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation or any agreement we may enter into with our regulators from time to time then we would not be able to declare or pay a dividend for such dividend period in such a case holders of the depositary shares will not be entitled to receive any dividend for that dividend period and the unpaid dividend will cease to accrue and be payable legalcompliance risks inability to fulfill minimum capital requirements could limit our ability to conduct or expand our business pay a dividend or result in termination of our fdic deposit insurance and thus impact our financial condition our results of operations and the market value of our stock we are subject to the comprehensive consolidated supervision and regulation set forth by the frb such regulation includes among other matters the level of leverage and riskbased capital ratios we are required to maintain depending on general economic conditions changes in our capital position could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and risk profile and also could limit our ability to grow through acquisitions or otherwise compliance with regulatory capital requirements may limit our ability to engage in operations that require the intensive use of capital and therefore could adversely affect our ability to maintain our current level of business or expand furthermore it is possible that future regulatory changes could result in more stringent capital or liquidity requirements including increases in the levels of regulatory capital we are required to maintain and changes in the way capital or liquidity is measured for regulatory purposes either of which could adversely affect our business and our ability to expand for example federal banking regulations adopted under basel iii standards require bank holding companies and banks to undertake significant activities to demonstrate compliance with higher capital requirements any additional requirements to increase our capital ratios or liquidity could necessitate our liquidating certain assets perhaps on terms that are unfavorable to us or that are contrary to our business plans in addition such requirements could also compel us to issue additional securities thus diluting the value of our common stock in addition failure to meet established capital requirements could result in the frb placing limitations or conditions on our activities and further restricting the commencement of new activities the failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities including limiting our ability to pay dividends issuing a directive to increase our capital and terminating our fdic deposit insurance our results of operations could be materially affected by further changes in bank regulation or by our ability to comply with certain existing laws rules and regulations governing our industry we are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the following entities the occ the fdic the frbny and the cfpb as well as state licensing restrictions and limitations regarding certain consumer finance products such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank holding company and its banking subsidiaries may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the dif the banking system in general and bank customers rather than for the benefit of a companys stockholders these regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities including with respect to the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank or a bank holding company the imposition of significant fines the ability to delay or deny merger or other regulatory applications the classification of assets by a bank and the adequacy of a banks allowance for loan losses among other matters failure to comply or to ensure that our agents and thirdparty service providers comply with laws regulations or policies including our failure to obtain any necessary state or local licenses could result in enforcement actions or sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties andor reputational damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations penalties for such violations may also include revocation of licenses fines and other monetary penalties civil and criminal liability substantially reduced payments by borrowers modification of the original terms of loans permanent forgiveness of debt or inability to directly or indirectly collect all or a part of the principal of or interest on loans provided by the bank changes in such regulation and supervision or changes in regulation or enforcement by such authorities whether in the form of policy regulations legislation rules orders enforcement actions ratings or decisions could have a material impact on the company our subsidiary bank and other affiliates and our operations in addition failure of the company or the bank to comply with such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and capital see regulation and supervision in part i item business earlier in this filing for a detailed description of the federal state and local regulations to which the company and the bank are subject noncompliance with the bank secrecy act and other antimoney laundering statutes and regulations could result in material financial loss the bsa and the usa patriot act contain antimoney laundering and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the us financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities the bsa as amended by the usa patriot act requires depository institutions to undertake activities including maintaining an antimoney laundering program verifying the identity of clients monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions reporting on cash transactions above a certain threshold and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies fincen a unit of the us treasury department that administers the bsa is authorized to impose significant civil monetary penalties for violations of these requirements if our bsa policies procedures and systems are deemed to be deficient or the bsa policies procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we acquire in the future are deficient we would be subject to reputational risk and potential liability including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan including our acquisition plans which would negatively impact our business financial condition and results of operations failure to comply with ofac regulations could result in legal and reputational risks the united states has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries foreign nationals and other potentially exposed persons these are typically referred to as the ofac rules given their administration by the united states treasury department office of foreign assets control failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences our enterprise risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating the risks to which we are subject based upon the size scope and complexity of the company as a financial institution we are subject to a number of risks including interest rate credit liquidity legalcompliance market strategic operational and reputational our erm framework is designed to minimize the risks to which we are subject as well as any losses stemming from such risks although we seek to identify measure monitor report and control our exposure to such risks and employ a broad and diverse set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques in the process those techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or development of risks that are currently unknown and unanticipated for example economic and market conditions heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry and increases in the overall complexity of our operations among other developments have resulted in the creation of a variety of risks that were previously unknown and unanticipated highlighting the intrinsic limitations of our risk monitoring and mitigation techniques as a result the further development of previously unknown or unanticipated risks may result in our incurring losses in the future that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations furthermore an ineffective erm framework as well as other risk factors could result in a material increase in our fdic insurance premiums if federal state or local tax authorities were to determine that we did not adequately provide for our taxes our income tax expense could be increased adversely affecting our earnings the amount of income taxes we are required to pay on our earnings is based on federal state and local legislation and regulations we provide for current and deferred taxes in our financial statements based on our results of operations business activity legal structure interpretation of tax statutes assessment of risk of adjustment upon audit and application of financial accounting standards we may take tax return filing positions for which the final determination of tax is uncertain and our net income and earnings per share could be reduced if a federal state or local authority were to assess additional taxes that have not been provided for in our consolidated financial statements in addition there can be no assurance that we will achieve our anticipated effective tax rate unanticipated changes in tax laws or related regulatory or judicial guidance or an audit assessment that denies previously recognized tax benefits could result in our recording tax expenses that materially reduce our net income we are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers including the community reinvestment act fair lending laws and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions the cra requires the federal reserve to assess our performance in meeting the credit needs of the communities we serve including low and moderateincome neighborhoods if the federal reserve determines that we need to improve our performance or are in substantial noncompliance with cra requirements various adverse regulatory consequences may ensue in addition the equal credit opportunity act the fair housing act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions the cfpb the us department of justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations the cfpb is also authorized to prescribe rules applicable to any covered person or service provider identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are unfair deceptive or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service or the offering of a consumer financial product or service a successful regulatory challenge to an institutions performance under the cra fair lending laws or regulations or consumer lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions including damages and civil money penalties injunctive relief restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institutions performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally state attorneys general have indicated that they intend to take a more active role in enforcing consumer protection laws including through use of doddfrank act provisions that authorize state attorneys general to enforce certain provisions of federal consumer financial laws and obtain civil money penalties and other relief available to the cfpb if we become subject to such investigation the required response could result in substantial costs and a diversion of the attention and resources of our management market risks a decline in economic conditions could adversely affect the value of the loans we originate and the securities in which we invest declines in real estate values and an increase in the financial stress on borrowers stemming from high unemployment or other adverse economic conditions could negatively affect our borrowers and in turn the repayment of the loans in our portfolio deterioration in economic conditions also could subject us and our industry to increased regulatory scrutiny and could result in an increase in loan delinquencies an increase in problem assets and foreclosures and a decline in the value of the collateral for our loans which could reduce our customers borrowing power deterioration in local economic conditions could drive the level of loan losses beyond the level we have provided for in our loan loss allowance this in turn could necessitate an increase in our provisions for loan losses which would reduce our earnings and capital furthermore declines in the value of our investment securities could result in our having to record losses based on the otherthantemporary impairment of securities which would reduce our earnings and also could reduce our capital in addition continued economic weakness could reduce the demand for our products and services which would adversely impact our liquidity and the revenues we produce higher inflation could have a negative impact on our financial results and operations inflation can negatively impact the company by increasing our labor costs through higher wages and higher interest rates which may negatively affect the market value of securities on our balance sheet higher interest expenses on our deposits especially cds and a higher cost of our borrowings additionally higher inflation levels could lead to higher oil and gas prices which may negatively impact the net operating income on the properties which we lend on and could impair a borrowers ability to repay their mortgage rising mortgage rates and adverse changes in mortgage market conditions could reduce mortgage revenue the residential real estate mortgage lending business is sensitive to changes in interest rates especially longterm interest rates lower interest rates generally increase the volume of mortgage originations while higher interest rates generally cause that volume to decrease therefore our mortgage performance is typically correlated to fluctuations in interest rates primarily the 10year us treasury rate historically mortgage origination volume and sales for the bank and for other financial institutions have risen and fallen in response to these and other factors an increase in interest rates andor a decrease in our mortgage production volume could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results the 10year us treasury rate was percent at december and averaged percent during basis points higher than average rates experienced during the sustained higher rates experienced throughout negatively impacted the mortgage market including our loan origination volume and refinancing activity in addition to being affected by interest rates the secondary mortgage markets are also subject to investor demand for residential mortgage loans and investor yield requirements for these loans these conditions may fluctuate or worsen in the future adverse market conditions including increased volatility changes in interest rates and mortgage spreads and reduced market demand could result in greater risk in retaining mortgage loans pending their sale to investors a prolonged period of secondary market illiquidity may result in a reduction of our loan mortgage production volume and could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our mortgage origination business is also subject to the cyclical and seasonal trends of the real estate market the cyclical nature of our industry could lead to periods of growth in the mortgage and real estate markets followed by periods of declines and losses in such markets seasonal trends have historically reflected the general patterns of residential and commercial real estate sales which typically peak in the spring and summer seasons one of the primary influences on our mortgage business is the aggregate demand for mortgage loans which is affected by prevailing interest rates housing supply and demand residential construction trends and overall economic conditions if we are unable to respond to the cyclical nature of our industry by appropriately adjusting our operations or relying on the strength of our other product offerings during cyclical downturns our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected additionally the fair value of our msrs is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in market implied interest rate volatility decreases in interest rates can trigger an increase in actual repayments and market expectation for higher levels of repayments in the future which have a negative impact on msr fair value conversely higher rates typically drive lower repayments which results in an increase in the msr fair value we utilize derivatives to manage the impact of changes in the fair value of the msrs we may have basis risk and our risk management strategies which rely on assumptions or projections may not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates interest rate volatility convexity credit spreads or prepayment speeds and as a result the change in the fair value of msrs may negatively impact earnings we are highly dependent on the agencies to buy mortgage loans that we originate changes in these entities and changes in the manner or volume of loans they purchase or their current roles could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we generate mortgage revenues primarily from gains on the sale of singlefamily residential loans pursuant to programs currently offered by fannie mae freddie mac ginnie mae and other investors these entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans any future changes in these programs our eligibility to participate in such programs their concentration limits with respect to loans purchased from us the criteria for loans to be accepted or laws that significantly affect the activity of such entities could in turn result in a lower volume of corresponding loan originations or other administrative costs which may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations or could cause us to take other actions that would be materially detrimental fannie mae and freddie mac remain in conservatorship and a path forward for them to emerge from conservatorship is unclear their roles could be reduced modified or eliminated as a result of regulatory actions and the nature of their guarantees could be limited or eliminated relative to historical measurements the elimination or modification of the traditional roles of fannie mae or freddie mac could create additional competition in the market and significantly and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations changes in the servicing origination or underwriting guidelines or criteria required by the agencies could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we are required to follow specific guidelines or criteria that impact the way we originate underwrite or service loans guidelines include credit standards for mortgage loans our staffing levels and other servicing practices the servicing and ancillary fees that we may charge modification standards and procedures and the amount of nonreimbursable advances we cannot negotiate these terms which are subject to change at any time with the agencies a significant change in these guidelines which decreases the fees we charge or requires us to expend additional resources in providing mortgage services could decrease our revenues or increase our costs adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations in addition changes in the nature or extent of the guarantees provided by fannie mae and freddie mac or the insurance provided by the fha could also have broad adverse market implications the fees that we are required to pay to the agencies for these guarantees have changed significantly over time and any future increases in these fees would adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations strategic risks extensive competition for loans and deposits could adversely affect our ability to expand our business as well as our financial condition and results of operations because our profitability stems from our ability to attract deposits and originate loans our continued ability to compete for depositors and borrowers is critical to our success our success as a competitor depends on a number of factors including our ability to develop maintain and build longterm relationships with our customers by providing them with convenience in the form of multiple branch locations extended hours of service and access through alternative delivery channels a broad and diverse selection of products and services interest rates and service fees that compare favorably with those of our competitors and skilled and knowledgeable personnel to assist our customers by addressing their financial needs external factors that may impact our ability to compete include among others the entry of new lenders and depository institutions in our current markets and with regard to lending an increased focus on multifamily and cre lending by existing competitors limitations on our ability to grow our loan portfolios could adversely affect our ability to generate interest income as well our financial condition and results of operations perhaps materially our portfolios of multifamily and cre loans represent the largest portion of our asset mix percent of total loans held for investment as of december our leadership position in these markets has been instrumental to our production of solid earnings and our consistent record of exceptional asset quality we monitor the ratio of our multifamily cre and adc loans as defined in the cre guidance to our total riskbased capital to ensure that we are in compliance with regulatory guidance any inability to grow our multifamily and cre loan portfolios could negatively impact our ability to grow our earnings per share the inability to engage in merger transactions or to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions in which we might engage could adversely affect our ability to compete with other financial institutions and weaken our financial performance our ability to engage in future mergers and acquisitions would depend on our ability to identify suitable merger partners and acquisition opportunities our ability to finance and complete negotiated transactions at acceptable prices and on acceptable terms and our ability to obtain the necessary stockholder and regulatory approvals if we are unable to engage in or complete a desired acquisition or merger transaction our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted as acquisitions have been a significant source of deposits the inability to complete a business combination could require that we increase the interest rates we pay on deposits in order to attract such funding through our current branch network or that we increase our use of wholesale funds increasing our cost of funds could adversely impact our net interest income and our net income furthermore the absence of acquisitions could impact our ability to fulfill our loan demand in addition mergers and acquisitions can lead to uncertainties about the future on the part of customers and employees such uncertainties could cause customers and others to consider changing their existing business relationships with the company to be acquired and could cause its employees to accept positions with other companies before the merger occurs as a result the ability of a company to attract and retain customers and to attract retain and motivate key personnel prior to a mergers completion could be impaired furthermore no assurance can be given that acquired operations would not adversely affect our existing profitability that we would be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by our existing banking business that we would be able to compete effectively in the market areas served by acquired branches or that we would be able to manage any growth resulting from a transaction effectively in particular our ability to compete effectively in new markets would be dependent on our ability to understand those markets and their competitive dynamics and our ability to retain certain key employees from the acquired institution who know those markets better than we do we may be exposed to challenges in combining the operations of acquired or merged businesses including our recent flagstar acquisition into our operations which may prevent us from achieving the expected benefits from our merger and acquisition activities we may not be able to fully achieve the strategic objectives and operating efficiencies that we anticipate in our merger and acquisition activities inherent uncertainties exist in integrating the operations of an acquired business we may lose our customers or the customers of acquired entities as a result of the acquisition we may also lose key personnel from the acquired entity as a result of an acquisition we may not discover all known and unknown factors when examining a company for acquisition or merger during the due diligence period these factors could produce unintended and unexpected consequences for us including but not limited to increased compliance and legal risks including increased litigation or regulatory actions such as fines or restrictions related to the business practices or operations of the combined business undiscovered factors as a result of an acquisition or merger could bring civil criminal and financial liabilities against us our management and the management of those entities we acquire or merge with in addition if difficulties arise with respect to the integration process we may incur higher integration expenses than anticipated and the economic benefits expected to result from the acquisition including revenue growth and cost savings might not occur or might not occur to the extent we expected failure to successfully integrate businesses that we acquire or merge with could have an adverse effect on our profitability return on equity return on assets or our ability to implement our strategy any of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the inability to receive dividends from our subsidiary bank could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations as well as our ability to maintain or increase the current level of cash dividends we pay to our stockholders the parent company ie the company on an unconsolidated basis is a separate and distinct legal entity from the bank and a substantial portion of the revenues the parent company receives consists of dividends from the bank these dividends are the primary funding source for the dividends we pay on our common stock and the interest and principal payments on our debt various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that a bank may pay to its parent company in addition our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon the liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary may be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors as a result of our acquisition of flagstar we are required to seek regulatory approval from the occ for the payment of any dividend to the bancorp through at least the period ending november if the bank is unable to pay dividends to the parent company we might not be able to service our debt pay our obligations or pay dividends on our common stock reduction or elimination of our quarterly cash dividend could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds available for such payments under applicable law and regulatory guidance and although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so furthermore the payment of dividends falls under federal regulations that have grown more stringent in recent years while we pay our quarterly cash dividend in compliance with current regulations such regulations could change in the future as a result of our acquisition of flagstar we are required to seek regulatory approval from the occ for the payment of any dividend to the parent company through at least the period ending november which could restrict our ability to pay the common stock dividend any reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend in the future could adversely affect the market price of our common stock operational risks our stress testing processes rely on analytical and forecasting models that may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate which could adversely affect the effectiveness of our strategic planning and our ability to pursue certain corporate goals the processes we use to estimate the effects of changing interest rates real estate values and economic indicators such as unemployment on our financial condition and results of operations depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models these models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances furthermore even if our assumptions are accurate predictors of future performance the models they are based on may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or implementation if the models we use in the process of managing our interest rate and other risks prove to be inadequate or inaccurate we could incur increased or unexpected losses which in turn could adversely affect our earnings and capital additionally failure by the company to maintain compliance with strict capital liquidity and other stress test requirements under banking regulations could subject us to regulatory sanctions including limitations on our ability to pay dividends any failure breach or interruption in service involving our systems or those of our service providers could damage our reputation cause losses increase our expenses and result in a loss of customers an increase in regulatory scrutiny heightened cyber risk or expose us to civil litigation and possibly financial liability any of which could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations and the market price of our stock communication and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business as we use such systems and those maintained and provided to us by thirdparty service providers to manage our customer relationships our general ledger our deposits and our loans in addition our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant the security of our computer systems software and networks may be vulnerable to breaches unauthorized access misuse computer viruses or other malicious code and cyberattacks that could have an impact on information security with the rise and permeation of online and mobile banking the financial services industry in particular faces substantial cybersecurity risk due to the type of sensitive information provided by customers our systems and those of our thirdparty service providers and customers are under constant threat and it is possible that we or they could experience a significant event in the future that could adversely affect our business or operations in addition breaches of security may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having authorized or unauthorized access to our confidential or other information or that of our customers clients or counterparties if one or more of such events were to occur the confidential and other information processed and stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks could potentially be jeopardized or could otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers clients or counterparties this could cause us significant reputational damage or result in our experiencing significant losses while we diligently assess applicable regulatory and legislative developments affecting our business laws and regulations relating to cybersecurity have been frequently changing imposing new requirements on us in light of these conditions we face the potential for additional regulatory scrutiny that will lead to increasing compliance and technology expenses and in some cases possible limitations on the achievement of our plans for growth and other strategic objectives we may also be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks including expenses for thirdparty expert consultants or outside counsel we also may be subject to litigation and financial losses that either are not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance we maintain we believe that the impact of any previously identified cyber incidents will not have a material financial impact and we have cyber insurance in place in addition we routinely transmit and receive personal confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means we have discussed and worked with our customers clients and counterparties to develop secure transmission capabilities but we do not have and may be unable to put in place secure capabilities with all of these constituents and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information we maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure we will timely and sufficiently notify our investors of material cybersecurity risks and incidents including the associated financial legal or reputational consequence of such an event as well as reviewing and updating any prior disclosures relating to the risk or event while we have established information security policies and procedures including an incident response plan to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures and interruptions we may not be able to anticipate all possible security breaches that could affect our systems or information and there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or will be adequately prevented or mitigated if they do the company and the bank rely on third parties to perform certain key business functions which may expose us to further operational risk we outsource certain key aspects of our data processing to certain thirdparty providers while we have selected these thirdparty providers carefully we cannot control their actions our ability to deliver products and services to our customers to adequately process and account for our customers transactions or otherwise conduct our business could be adversely impacted by any disruption in the services provided by these third parties their failure to handle current or higher volumes of usage or any difficulties we may encounter in communicating with them replacing these thirdparty providers also could entail significant delay and expense our thirdparty providers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access computer viruses phishing schemes and other security breaches threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other thirdparty providers and their personnel we may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches and computer viruses or to alleviate problems caused by such security breaches or viruses to the extent that the activities of our thirdparty providers or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims regulatory scrutiny litigation and other possible liabilities these types of thirdparty relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and oversight by federal bank regulators such as the federal reserve board the office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance corporation and the cfpb as a result if our regulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over vendors and subcontractors or other ongoing thirdparty business relationships or that such thirdparties have not performed appropriately we could be subject to enforcement actions including civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for consumer remediation in addition the company may not be adequately insured against all types of losses resulting from thirdparty failures and our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from systems failures or other disruptions to our banking services failure to keep pace with technological changes could have a material adverse impact on our ability to compete for loans and deposits and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations financial products and services have become increasingly technologydriven our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively and in a costefficient manner is dependent on our ability to keep pace with technological advances and invest in new technology as it becomes available many of our competitors have greater resources than we do and may be better equipped to invest in and market new technologydriven products and services the inability to attract and retain key personnel could adversely impact our operations to a large degree our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel whose expertise knowledge of our markets and years of industry experience make them difficult to replace competition for skilled leaders in our industry can be intense and we may not be able to hire or retain the people we would like to have working for us the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business given the specialized knowledge of such personnel and the difficulty of finding qualified replacements on a timely basis furthermore our ability to attract and retain personnel with the skills and knowledge to support our business may require that we offer additional compensation and benefits that would reduce our earnings many aspects of our operations are dependent upon the soundness of other financial intermediaries and thus could expose us to systemic risk the soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of relationships between them involving credit trading execution of transactions and the like as a result concerns about or a default or threatened default by one institution could lead to significant marketwide liquidity and credit problems losses or defaults by other institutions as such systemic risk may adversely affect the financial intermediaries with which we interact on a daily basis such as clearing agencies clearing houses banks and securities firms and exchanges we could be adversely impacted as well we may be terminated as a servicer or subservicer or incur costs liabilities fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions at december we had relationships with owners of msrs excluding ourselves for which we act as subservicer for the mortgage loans they own due to the limited number of relationships discontinuation of existing agreements with those third parties or adverse changes in contractual terms could have a significant negative impact to our mortgage servicing revenue the terms and conditions in which a master servicer may terminate subservicing contracts are broad and could be exercised at the discretion of the master servicer without requiring cause additionally the master servicer directs the oversight of custodial deposits associated with serviced loans and to the extent allowable could choose to transfer the oversight of the banks custodial deposits to another depository institution further as servicer or subservicer of loans we have certain contractual obligations including foreclosing on defaulted mortgage loans or to the extent applicable considering alternatives to foreclosure if we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice causing us to lose servicing income we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans pay fees or indemnify buyers against losses when mortgage loans are sold by us we make customary representations and warranties to purchasers guarantors and insurers including the agencies about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated whole loan sale agreements may require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans or indemnify buyers against losses in the event we breach these representations or warranties in addition we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower or we may be required to pay fees we may also be subject to litigation relating to these representations and warranties which may result in significant costs with respect to loans that are originated through our broker or correspondent channels the remedies we have available against the originating broker or correspondent if any may not be as broad as the remedies available to purchasers guarantors and insurers of mortgage loans against us we also face further risk that the originating broker or correspondent if any may not have the financial capacity to perform remedies that otherwise may be available therefore if a purchaser guarantor or insurer enforces its remedies against us we may not be able to recover losses from the originating broker or correspondent if repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid claims our liquidity results of operations and financial condition may also be adversely affected for certain investors andor certain transactions we may be contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse the investor for credit or other losses incurred on the loan as a remedy for servicing errors with respect to the loan if we have increased repurchase obligations because of claims for which we did not satisfy our obligations or increased loss severity on such repurchases we may have a significant reduction to noninterest income or an increase to noninterest expense we may incur significant costs if we are required to or if we elect to reexecute or refile documents or take other action in our capacity as a servicer in connection with pending or completed foreclosures we may incur litigation costs if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower any of these actions may harm our reputation or negatively affect our servicing business and as a result our profitability the pipeline represents the upb for loans the agencies identified as potentially needing to be repurchased and the estimated probable loss associated with these loans is included in our representation and warranty reserve while we believe the level of the reserve to be appropriate the reserve may not be adequate to cover losses for loans that we have sold or securitized for which we may be subsequently required to repurchase pay fines or fees or indemnify purchasers and insurers because of violations of customary representations and warranties additionally the pipeline could increase substantially without warning our regulators as part of their supervisory function may review our representation and warranty reserve for losses and may recommend or require us to increase our reserve based upon their judgment which may differ from that of management we utilize thirdparty mortgage originators which subjects us to strategic reputation compliance and operational risk we utilize thirdparty mortgage originators ie mortgage brokers and correspondent lenders who are not our employees these third parties originate mortgages or provide services to many different banks and other entities accordingly they may have relationships with or loyalties to such banks and other parties that are different from those they have with or to us failure to maintain good relations with such thirdparty mortgage originators could have a negative impact on our market share which would negatively impact our results of operations we rely on thirdparty mortgage originators to originate and document the mortgage loans we purchase or originate while we perform due diligence on the mortgage companies with whom we do business as well as review the loan files and loan documents we purchase to attempt to detect any irregularities or legal noncompliance we have less control over these originators than employees of the bank due to regulatory scrutiny our thirdparty mortgage originators could choose or be required to either reduce the scope of their business or exit the mortgage origination business altogether the tilarespa integrated disclosure rule issued by the cfpb establishes comprehensive mortgage disclosure requirements for lenders and settlement agents in connection with most closedend consumer credit transactions secured by real property the rule requires certain disclosures to be provided to consumers in connection with applying for and closing on a mortgage loan the rule also mandates the use of specific disclosure forms timing of communicating information to borrowers and certain record keeping requirements the ongoing administrative burden and the system requirements associated with complying with these rules or potential changes to these rules could impact our mortgage volume and increase costs these arrangements with thirdparty mortgage originators and the fees payable by us to such third parties could also be subject to future regulatory scrutiny and restrictions the equal credit opportunity act the consumer protection act and the fair housing act prohibit discriminatory and other lending practices by lenders including financial institutions mortgage and consumer lending practices raise compliance risks resulting from the detailed and complex nature of mortgage and consumer lending laws and regulations imposed by federal regulatory agencies as well as the relatively independent and diverse operating channels in which loans are originated as we originate loans through various channels we and our thirdparty originators are especially impacted by these laws and regulations and are required to implement appropriate policies and procedures to help ensure compliance with fair lending laws and regulations and to avoid lending practices that result in the disparate treatment of or disparate impact to borrowers across our various locations under multiple channels failure to comply with these laws and regulations by us or our thirdparty originators could result in the bank being liable for damages to individual borrowers changes in business practices or other imposed penalties we are subject to various legal or regulatory investigations and proceedings at any given time we are involved with a number of legal and regulatory examinations as a part of the routine reviews conducted by regulators and other parties which may involve consumer protection employment tort and numerous other laws and regulations proceedings or actions brought against us may result in judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions business improvement orders consent orders supervisory agreements restrictions on our business activities or other results adverse to us which could materially and negatively affect our business if such claims and other matters are not resolved in a manner favorable to us they may result in significant financial liability andor adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject may provide a private right of action that a consumer or class of consumers may pursue to enforce these laws and regulations we have been and may be in the future subject to stockholder class and derivative actions which could seek significant damages or other relief any financial liability or reputational damage could have a materially adverse effect on our business which could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations claims asserted against us can be highly complicated and slow to develop making the outcome of such proceedings difficult to predict or estimate early in the process as a participant in the financial services industry it is likely that we will be exposed to a high level of litigation and regulatory scrutiny relating to our business and operations although we establish accruals for legal or regulatory proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we do not have accruals for all legal or regulatory proceedings where we face a risk of loss due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal and regulatory proceedings in question as a result our ultimate losses may be significantly higher than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies for further information see note contingencies and commitments we may be required to pay interest on certain mortgage escrow accounts in accordance with certain state laws despite the federal preemption under the national bank act in the ninth circuit federal court of appeals held that california state law requiring mortgage servicers to pay interest on certain mortgage escrow accounts was not as a matter of law preempted by the national bank act lusnak v bank of america this ruling goes against the position that regulators national banks and other federallychartered financial institutions have taken regarding the preemption of statelaw mortgage escrow interest requirements the opinion issued by the ninth circuit federal court of appeals is legal precedent only in certain parts of the western united states we are defending similar litigation in california and are currently appealing a federal district court judgment against us in that case to the ninth circuit we are arguing that the lusnak case was wrongly decided we believe our situation can be distinguished from lusnak as a matter of law and californias interest on escrow law should be preempted as a matter of fact if the ninth circuits holding is more broadly adopted by other federal circuits including those covering states that currently have enacted or in the future may enact statutes requiring the payment of interest on escrow balances or if we would be required to retroactively credit interest on escrow funds the companys earnings could be adversely affected reputational risk damage to our reputation could significantly harm the businesses we engage in as well as our competitive position and prospects for growth our ability to attract and retain investors customers clients and employees could be adversely affected by damage to our reputation resulting from various sources including employee misconduct litigation or regulatory outcomes failure to deliver minimum standards of service and quality compliance failures unintentional disproportionate assessment of fees to customers of protected classes unethical behavior unintended disclosure of confidential information and the activities of our clients customers andor counterparties actions by the financial services industry in general or by certain entities or individuals within it also could have a significantly adverse impact on our reputation our actual or perceived failure to identify and address various issues also could give rise to reputational risk that could significantly harm us and our business prospects including failure to properly address operational risks these issues include legal and regulatory requirements consumer protection fair lending and privacy issues properly maintaining customer and associated personal information record keeping protecting against money laundering sales and trading practices and ethical issues increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers regulators investors and other stakeholders with respect to our environmental social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks companies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers regulators investors and other stakeholders related to their environmental social and governance esg practices and disclosure investor advocacy groups investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices especially as they relate to the environment health and safety diversity labor conditions and human rights increased esgrelated compliance costs could result in increases to our overall operational costs failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation ability to do business with certain partners and our stock price new government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of esg oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting diligence and disclosure additionally concerns over the longterm impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts investors consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns the company and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as investor consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns the company and its customers may face cost increases asset value reductions and operating process changes among other impacts the impact on the companys customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities in addition the company would face reductions in credit worthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans investors could determine not to invest in the companys securities due to various climate change related considerations the companys efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions may not be effective in protecting the company from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in investor consumer or business behavior
