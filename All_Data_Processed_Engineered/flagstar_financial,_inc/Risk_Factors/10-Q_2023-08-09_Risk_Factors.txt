diligently assess applicable regulatory and legislative developments affecting our business laws and regulations relating to cybersecurity have been frequently changing imposing new requirements on us in light of these conditions we face the potential for additional regulatory scrutiny that will lead to increasing compliance and technology expenses and in some cases possible limitations on the achievement of our plans for growth and other strategic objectives we may also be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks including expenses for thirdparty expert consultants or outside counsel we also may be subject to litigation and

subject to ongoing investigation and remediation will not have a material financial impact and we have cyber insurance in place in addition we routinely transmit and receive personal confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means we have discussed and worked with our customers clients and counterparties to develop secure transmission capabilities but we do not have and may be unable to put in place secure capabilities with all of these constituents and we may not be able to ensure that these third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information we maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure we will timely and sufficiently notify our investors of material cybersecurity risks and incidents including the associated financial legal or reputational consequence of such an event as well as reviewing and updating any prior disclosures relating to the risk or event while we have established information security policies and procedures including an incident response plan to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures and interruptions we may not be able to anticipate all possible security breaches that could affect our systems or information and there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or will be adequately prevented or mitigated if they do
