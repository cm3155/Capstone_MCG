item risk factors please see item risk factors of the companys annual report on for a detailed description of the federal state and local regulations to which the company and the bank are subject as a category iv banking organization with over billion in assets we are subject to stringent regulations including reporting capital stress testing and liquidity risk management noncompliance could result in regulatory risks and restrictions on our activities as a result of the signature transaction our total assets exceeded billion and therefore we became classified as a category iv banking organization under the rules issued by the federal banking agencies that tailor the application of enhanced prudential standards to large bank holding companies and the capital and liquidity rules to large bank holding companies and depository institutions under the doddfrank act and the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act as a category iv banking organization we are subject to enhanced liquidity risk management requirements which include reporting liquidity stress testing a liquidity buffer and resolution planning subject to the applicable transition periods if we were to meet or exceed certain other thresholds for asset size we would become subject to additional requirements failure to meet these requirements could expose us to compliance risks higher penalties increased expectations and limitations on our activities as a category iv banking organization we are required to implement and maintain an adequate liquidity risk management and monitoring process to ensure compliance with these requirements and our failure to ensure compliance may have adverse consequences on our operations reputation and future profitability we anticipate incurring significant expenses to develop policies programs and systems that comply with the enhanced standards applicable to us our enterprise risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating the risks to which we are subject based upon the size scope and complexity of the company as a financial institution we are subject to a number of risks including interest rate credit liquidity legalcompliance market strategic operational and reputational our erm framework is designed to minimize the risks to which we are subject as well as any losses stemming from such risks although we seek to identify measure monitor report and control our exposure to such risks and employ a broad and diverse set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques in the process those techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or development of risks that are currently unknown and unanticipated for example economic and market conditions heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry and increases in the overall complexity of our operations among other developments have resulted in the creation of a variety of risks that were previously unknown and unanticipated highlighting the intrinsic limitations of our risk monitoring and mitigation techniques as a result the further development of previously unknown or unanticipated risks may result in our incurring losses in the future that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations furthermore an ineffective erm framework as well as other risk factors could result in a material increase in our fdic insurance premiums legislative and regulatory focus on data privacy and risks can subject us to heightened scrutiny and reputational damage data privacy and cybersecurity risks have become a subject of heightened legislative and regulatory focus in recent years federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed regulations to enhance cyber risk management standards which would apply to us and our thirdparty service providers these regulations focus on areas such as cyber risk governance management of dependencies incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness statelevel legislation and regulations have also been proposed or adopted requiring notification to individuals in the event of a security breach of their personal data examples include the california consumer privacy act ccpa and other statelevel privacy data protection and data security laws and regulations we collect maintain and use nonpublic personal information of our customers clients employees and others the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are governed by federal and state laws compliance with these laws is essential to protect the privacy of personal information and avoid potential liability and reputational damage failure to comply with privacy laws and regulations may expose us to fines litigation or regulatory enforcement actions it may also require changes to our systems business practices or privacy policies which could adversely impact our operating results privacy initiatives have imposed and will continue to impose additional operational burdens on us these initiatives may limit our ability to pursue desirable business initiatives and increase the risks associated with any future use of personal data new privacy and data protection initiatives such as the ccpa may require changes to policies procedures and technology for information security and data segregation noncompliance with these initiatives may make us more vulnerable to operational failures and subject to monetary penalties litigation or regulatory enforcement actions we are subject to various legal or regulatory investigations and proceedings at any given time we are involved with a number of legal and regulatory examinations as a part of reviews conducted by regulators and other parties which may involve banking securities consumer protection employment tort and numerous other laws and regulations proceedings or actions brought against us may result in judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions business improvement orders consent orders supervisory agreements ratings downgrades restrictions on our business activities changes in fdic deposit insurance premium assessments or other results adverse to us which could materially and negatively affect our business if such claims and other matters are not resolved in a manner favorable to us they may result in significant financial liability andor adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject may provide a private right of action that a consumer or class of consumers may pursue to enforce these laws and regulations we are currently subject to stockholder class and derivative actions which seek significant damages and other relief and may be subject to similar actions in the future any financial liability or reputational damage could have a materially adverse effect on our business and in turn on our financial condition and results of operations claims asserted against us can be highly complicated and slow to develop making the outcome of such proceedings difficult to predict or estimate early in the process as a participant in the financial services industry it is likely that we will be exposed to a high level of litigation and regulatory scrutiny relating to our business and operations although we establish accruals for legal or regulatory proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we do not have accruals for all legal or regulatory proceedings where we face a risk of loss due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal and regulatory proceedings in question as a result our ultimate losses may be significantly higher than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies oversight and operational risk the company recently experienced turnover in its board of directors and executive management team and is embarking upon a new strategic plan which creates uncertainties and could harm its business the company has experienced significant changes in its board

chief audit executive and james simons evp special advisor to the ceo changes to strategic or operating goals which can often times occur with the appointment of new board members and new executives can create uncertainty may negatively impact the companys ability to execute quickly and effectively and may ultimately be unsuccessful in addition executive leadership transition periods are often difficult as the new executives gain detailed knowledge of the companys operations management turnover inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge which can negatively affect strategy and execution if the company does not integrate new executives and board members successfully the company may be unable to manage and grow its business and its financial condition and profitability may suffer as a result in addition the companys future success will depend on the ability of the board and the executive management team to effectively develop implement and execute a strategic plan there are risks and uncertainties associated with the creation implementation and execution of any strategic plan including the investment of time and resources the possibility that such strategic plan will ultimately be unprofitable or unsuccessful and the risk of additional liabilities associated with such strategic plan the companys successful execution of any strategic plan will require market conditions that will allow the company to achieve its strategic goals to the extent the company is unable to successfully develop implement and execute a strategic plan or if it experiences delays in the development planning and implementation process the companys business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected completing the diversification of the companys loan portfolio may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the plan may not be realized the company is pursuing a plan to diversify its loan portfolio which contemplates reducing its commercial real estate concentration and allow other nonstrategic assets to be run off or sold implementing and completing this plan is expected to take a considerable amount of time and attention of management and staff as they work to identify negotiate and execute upon opportunities to reposition the loan portfolio divest certain assets and effect potential transactions it is possible that the process of diversifying the companys loan portfolio could result in substantial disruption of the companys business and operations as the company may face the unexpected loss of key employees that it relies on to assist with the transition or to work on the companys continuing operations disruption of its ongoing businesses higher than anticipated costs adverse impacts to its relationships with its customers and employees or a failure to achieve the anticipated benefits andor cost savings if difficulties with diversifying the companys loan portfolio are encountered the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected the process of diversifying the companys loan portfolio will also divert management attention and resources and could have an adverse effect on the companys ability to operate efficiently as well as its results of operations and financial condition during the transition period and beyond the process of effecting the run off or sale of nonstrategic or other assets of the company could also result in substantial disruption of the companys business and operations for similar reasons as stated above further for any sales or divestitures of assets the companys ability to effect such divestiture or sale will depend upon various factors such as the companys ability to identify interested counterparties counterparties willingness to negotiate and enter into transactions with the company the potential of required regulatory approvals associated with such divestitures and the prices and other terms upon which any counterparty would be willing to transact with the company no assurances can be made that the company will be able to enter into or complete any sale or divestiture of any assets or that the failure to do so may have a negative impact on the companys business operations liquidity and financial condition
