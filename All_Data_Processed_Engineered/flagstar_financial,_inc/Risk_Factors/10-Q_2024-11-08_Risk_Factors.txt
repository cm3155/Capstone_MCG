item risk factors please see item risk factors of the companys annual report on form 10ka for the year ended december and below for information regarding risk factors that could materially affect the companys business financial condition or future results of operations other than as set forth below there have been no other changes with regard to the risk factors disclosed in item risk factors of the companys annual report on form 10ka for the year ended december liquidity risk failure to maintain an adequate level of liquidity could result in an inability to fulfill our financial obligations could subject us to material reputational and compliance risk and could lead to financial failure of the company our primary sources of liquidity are the retail and institutional deposits we gather or acquire in connection with acquisitions and the brokered deposits we accept borrowed funds primarily in the form of wholesale borrowings from the fhlbny and various wall street brokerage firms cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of loans and cash flows generated through the repayment and sale of securities in addition and depending on current market conditions we may have the ability to access the capital markets from time to time to generate additional liquidity deposit flows calls of investment securities and wholesale borrowings and the prepayment of loans and mortgagerelated securities are strongly influenced by such external factors as the direction of interest rates whether actual or perceived local and national economic conditions and competition for deposits and loans in the markets we serve deposit outflows can occur for a number of reasons including clients seeking higher yields clients with uninsured deposits may seek greater financial security or clients may simply prefer to do business with our competitors or for other reasons the withdrawal of more deposits than we anticipate could have an adverse impact on our profitability as this source of funding if not replaced by similar deposit funding would need to be replaced with more expensive wholesale funding the sale of interestearning assets other sources of funding or a combination of them all in extreme situations withdrawals could exceed our capacity to fund the withdrawals and lead to financial failure of the company as of september approximately percent of our total deposits of billion were not fdicinsured in addition largescale withdrawals of brokered or institutional deposits could require us to pay significantly higher interest rates on our retail deposits or on other wholesale funding sources which would have an adverse impact on our net interest income and net income furthermore changes to the fhlbnys underwriting guidelines for wholesale borrowings or lending policies may limit or restrict our ability to borrow and therefore could have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity a decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans invest in securities and meet our expenses or to fulfill such obligations as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands downgrades of the credit ratings of the company and the bank such as those announced by certain credit rating agencies in february march and may could result in an acceleration in deposit outflows and additional collateral needs they could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital and could significantly increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or to purchase our securities this could affect our growth profitability and financial condition including our liquidity credit risk our allowance for credit losses might not be sufficient to cover our actual losses which would adversely impact our financial condition regulatory capital ratios and results of operations in addition to mitigating credit risk through our underwriting processes we attempt to recognize such risk through the establishment of an allowance for credit losses the process of determining whether or not the allowance is sufficient to cover potential credit losses is based on the current expected credit loss model or current expected credit loss current expected credit loss may result in greater volatility in the level of the allowance for credit losses depending on various assumptions and factors used in determining the allowance for credit losses principally through mathematical modeling if the judgments and assumptions we make with regard to the allowance are incorrect our allowance for losses on such loans might not be sufficient and an additional provision for credit losses might need to be made depending on the amount of such loan loss provisions the adverse impact on our earnings could be material furthermore bank regulators have the authority to require us to make provisions for credit losses or otherwise recognize loan chargeoffs following their periodic review of our loan portfolio our underwriting procedures and our allowance for losses on such loans any increase in the loan loss allowance or in loan chargeoffs as required by such regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our concentration in multifamily loans and commercial real estate loans could expose us to increased lending risks and related loan losses at september billion or percent of our total loans and leases held for investment portfolio consisted of multifamily loans and billion or percent consisted of commercial real estate loans these types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of nonpayment and loss than onetofour family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the properties and the sale of such properties securing the loans such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to onetofour family residential loans also many of our borrowers have more than one of these types of loans outstanding consequently an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a onetofour family residential real estate loan in addition if loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition the commercial real estate loans we make are secured by incomeproducing properties such as office buildings retail centers mixeduse buildings and multitenanted light industrial properties at september billion or percent of our commercial real estate loan portfolio was secured by office buildings we may incur future losses on commercial real estate loans due to declines in occupancy rates and rental rates in office buildings which could occur as a result of less need for office space due to more people working from home or other factors our new york state multifamily loan portfolio could be adversely impacted by changes in legislation or regulation which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on june the new york state legislature passed the new york housing stability and tenant protection act of this legislation represents the most extensive reform of new york states rent laws in several decades and generally limits a landlords ability to increase rents on rent regulated apartments and makes it more difficult to convert rent regulated apartments to market rate apartments as a result the value of the collateral located in new york state securing the companys multifamily loans or the future net operating income of such properties could potentially become impaired which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations economic weakness in the new york city metropolitan region where the majority of the properties collateralizing our multi family commercial real estate and acquisition development and construction loans and the majority of the businesses collateralizing our other commercial and industrial loans are located could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations our business depends significantly on general economic conditions in the new york city metropolitan region where the majority of the buildings and properties securing the multifamily commercial real estate and acquisition development and construction loans we originate for investment and the businesses of the customers to whom we make our other commercial and industrial loans are located accordingly the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the collateral securing such loans may be significantly affected by economic conditions in this region including changes in the local real estate market a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation recession unemployment acts of terrorism extreme weather or other factors beyond our control could therefore have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition because multifamily and commercial real estate loans represent the majority of the loans in our portfolio a decline in tenant occupancy or rents due to such factors or for other reasons such as new legislation could adversely impact the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans on a timely basis which could have a negative impact on our net income furthermore economic or market turmoil could occur in the near or long term this could negatively affect our business our financial condition and our results of operations as well as our ability to maintain the level of cash dividends we currently pay to our stockholders legal and regulatory risk inability to fulfill minimum capital requirements could limit our ability to conduct or expand our business pay a dividend or result in termination of our fdic deposit insurance and thus impact our financial condition our results of operations and the market value of our stock we are subject to the comprehensive consolidated supervision and regulation set forth by the federal reserve board and the office of the comptroller of the currency such regulation includes among other matters the level of leverage and riskbased capital ratios we are required to maintain depending on general economic conditions changes in our capital position could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and risk profile and also could limit our ability to grow through acquisitions or otherwise compliance with regulatory capital requirements may limit our ability to engage in operations that require the intensive use of capital and therefore could adversely affect our ability to maintain our current level of business or expand furthermore it is possible that future regulatory changes could result in more stringent capital or liquidity requirements including increases in the levels of regulatory capital we are required to maintain and changes in the way capital or liquidity is measured for regulatory purposes either of which could adversely affect our business and our ability to expand for example federal banking regulations adopted under basel iii standards require bank holding companies and banks to undertake significant activities to demonstrate compliance with higher capital requirements any additional requirements to increase our capital ratios or liquidity could necessitate our liquidating certain assets perhaps on terms that are unfavorable to us or that are contrary to our business plans in addition such requirements could also compel us to issue additional securities thus diluting the value of our common stock in addition failure to meet established capital requirements could result in the federal reserve board andor office of the comptroller of the currency placing limitations or conditions on our activities and further restricting the commencement of new activities the failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject us to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities including limiting our ability to pay dividends issuing a directive to increase our capital and terminating our fdic deposit insurance our results of operations could be materially affected by the imposition of restrictions on our operations by bank regulators further changes in bank regulation or by our ability to comply with certain existing laws rules and regulations governing our industry we are subject to regulation supervision and examination by the following entities the office of the comptroller of the currency the fdic the federal reserve boardny and the consumer financial protection bureau as well as state licensing restrictions and limitations regarding certain consumer finance products such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank holding company and its banking subsidiaries may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund the banking system in general and bank customers rather than for the benefit of a companys stockholders these regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities including with respect to the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank or a bank holding company the imposition of significant fines the ability to delay or deny merger or other regulatory applications the payment of dividends the classification of assets by a bank and the adequacy of a banks allowance for loan losses among other matters failure to comply or to ensure that our agents and thirdparty service providers comply with laws regulations or policies including our failure to obtain any necessary state or local licenses could result in enforcement actions or sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties andor reputational damage which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations penalties for such violations may also include revocation of licenses fines and other monetary penalties civil and criminal liability substantially reduced payments by borrowers modification of the original terms of loans permanent forgiveness of debt or inability to directly or indirectly collect all or a part of the principal of or interest on loans provided by the bank changes in such regulation and supervision or changes in regulation or enforcement by such authorities whether in the form of policy regulations legislation rules orders enforcement actions ratings or decisions could have a material impact on the company our subsidiary bank and other affiliates and our operations including restrictions on the operation of a bank or a bank holding company and changes in fdic deposit insurance premium assessments in addition failure of the company or the bank to comply with such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and capital see regulation and supervision in part i item business in our annual report on form 10ka for the year ended december for a detailed description of the federal state and local regulations to which the company and the bank are subject as a category iv banking organization with over billion in assets we are subject to stringent regulations including reporting capital stress testing and liquidity risk management noncompliance could result in regulatory risks and restrictions on our activities as a result of the signature transaction our total assets exceeded billion and therefore we became classified as a category iv banking organization under the rules issued by the federal banking agencies that tailor the application of enhanced prudential standards to large bank holding companies and the capital and liquidity rules to large bank holding companies and depository institutions under the doddfrank act and the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act as a category iv banking organization we are subject to enhanced liquidity risk management requirements which include reporting liquidity stress testing a liquidity buffer and resolution planning subject to the applicable transition periods if we were to meet or exceed certain other thresholds for asset size we would become subject to additional requirements failure to meet these requirements could expose us to compliance risks higher penalties increased expectations and limitations on our activities as a category iv banking organization we are required to implement and maintain an adequate liquidity risk management and monitoring process to ensure compliance with these requirements and our failure to ensure compliance may have adverse consequences on our operations reputation and future profitability we anticipate incurring significant expenses to develop policies programs and systems that comply with the enhanced standards applicable to us our enterprise risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating the risks to which we are subject based upon the size scope and complexity of the company as a financial institution we are subject to a number of risks including interest rate credit liquidity legalcompliance market strategic operational and reputational our enterprise risk management framework is designed to minimize the risks to which we are subject as well as any losses stemming from such risks although we seek to identify measure monitor report and control our exposure to such risks and employ a broad and diverse set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques in the process those techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or development of risks that are currently unknown and unanticipated for example economic and market conditions heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry and increases in the overall complexity of our operations among other developments have resulted in the creation of a variety of risks that were previously unknown and unanticipated highlighting the intrinsic limitations of our risk monitoring and mitigation techniques as a result the further development of previously unknown or unanticipated risks may result in our incurring losses in the future that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations furthermore an ineffective enterprise risk management framework as well as other risk factors could result in a material increase in our fdic deposit insurance premium assessments legislative and regulatory focus on data privacy and risks can subject us to heightened scrutiny and reputational damage data privacy and cybersecurity risks have become a subject of heightened legislative and regulatory focus in recent years federal banking agencies have proposed regulations to enhance cyber risk management standards which would apply to us and our thirdparty service providers these regulations focus on areas such as cyber risk governance management of dependencies incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness statelevel legislation and regulations have also been proposed or adopted requiring notification to individuals in the event of a security breach of their personal data examples include the california consumer privacy act ccpa and other statelevel privacy data protection and data security laws and regulations we collect maintain and use nonpublic personal information of our customers clients employees and others the sharing use disclosure and protection of this information are governed by federal and state laws compliance with these laws is essential to protect the privacy of personal information and avoid potential liability and reputational damage failure to comply with privacy laws and regulations may expose us to fines litigation or regulatory enforcement actions it may also require changes to our systems business practices or privacy policies which could adversely impact our operating results privacy initiatives have imposed and will continue to impose additional operational burdens on us these initiatives may limit our ability to pursue desirable business initiatives and increase the risks associated with any future use of personal data new privacy and data protection initiatives such as the ccpa may require changes to policies procedures and technology for information security and data segregation noncompliance with these initiatives may make us more vulnerable to operational failures and subject to monetary penalties litigation or regulatory enforcement actions we are subject to various legal or regulatory investigations and proceedings at any given time we are involved with a number of legal proceedings and regulatory investigations and examinations as a part of reviews conducted by regulators and other parties which may involve banking securities consumer protection employment tort and numerous other laws and regulations the outcome of pending or threatened litigation or of investigations or any other matters before regulatory agencies is uncertain whether currently existing or commencing in the future including with respect to any litigation investigation or other regulatory actions related to i the business and disclosure practices of acquired companies including our acquisition of flagstar bancorp and the purchase and assumption of certain assets and liabilities of signature ii the capital raise transaction we completed in march of iii the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting disclosed in our most recent annual report on form 10ka iv past cyber security breaches and v recent events and circumstances involving the company including our full year earnings announcement disclosures regarding credit losses provisioning and goodwill impairment and negative news and expectations about the prospects of the company and associated stock price volatility and changes proceedings or actions brought against us may result in judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions business improvement orders consent orders supervisory agreements ratings downgrades restrictions on our business activities changes in fdic deposit insurance premium assessments or other results adverse to us which could materially and negatively affect our business if such claims and other matters are not resolved in a manner favorable to us they may result in significant financial liability andor adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject may provide a private right of action that a consumer or class of consumers may pursue to enforce these laws and regulations we are currently subject to stockholder class and derivative actions which seek significant damages and other relief and may be subject to similar actions in the future any financial liability or reputational damage could have a materially adverse effect on our business and in turn on our financial condition and results of operations claims asserted against us can be highly complicated and slow to develop making the outcome of such proceedings difficult to predict or estimate early in the process as a participant in the financial services industry it is likely that we will be exposed to a high level of litigation and regulatory scrutiny relating to our business and operations although we establish accruals for legal or regulatory proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we do not have accruals for all legal or regulatory proceedings where we face a risk of loss due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal and regulatory proceedings in question as a result our ultimate losses may be significantly higher than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies oversight and operational risk the company recently experienced turnover in its board of directors and executive management team and is embarking upon a new strategic plan which creates uncertainties and could harm its business the company has experienced significant changes in its board of directors and executive leadership during on or shortly after march thomas cangemi james carpenter leslie dunn lawrence rosano jr ronald rosenfeld lawrence savarese david treadwell and robert wann resigned as directors of the board additionally toan c huynh and hanif wally dahya resigned as directors of the board in february and peter schoels resigned as a director of the board in october three directors who were serving on the board as of december continue to serve on the board alessandro p dinello marshall j lux and jennifer r whip subsequent to september peter schoels resigned as a director of the board additionally on or shortly after march five new directors were appointed to the board former treasury secretary steven mnuchin joseph otting milton berlinski allen puwalski and alan frank additionally there have been a number of new appointments to the executive management team during the year on july the company announced five strategic objectives for the remainder of bolster management and the board ongoing execution of the operating plan achievable capital and earnings forecast improve funding profile and focus on credit risk the company is in the process of developing a strategic plan and expects to obtain board approval by year end changes to strategic or operating goals which can often times occur with the appointment of new board members and new executives can create uncertainty may negatively impact the companys ability to execute quickly and effectively and may ultimately be unsuccessful in addition executive leadership transition periods are often difficult as the new executives gain detailed knowledge of the companys operations management turnover inherently causes some loss of institutional knowledge which can negatively affect strategy and execution if the company does not integrate new executives and board members successfully the company may be unable to manage and grow its business and its financial condition and profitability may suffer as a result in addition the companys future success will depend on the ability of the board and the executive management team to effectively develop implement and execute a strategic plan there are risks and uncertainties associated with the creation implementation and execution of a new strategic plan including the investment of time and resources the possibility that such strategic plan will ultimately be unprofitable or unsuccessful and the risk of additional liabilities associated with such strategic plan the companys successful execution of any strategic plan will require market conditions that will allow the company to achieve its strategic goals to the extent the company is unable to successfully develop implement and execute a strategic plan or if it experiences delays in the development planning and implementation process the companys business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected completing the diversification of the companys loan portfolio may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the plan may not be realized the company is pursuing a plan to diversify its loan portfolio which contemplates reducing its commercial real estate concentration and allow other nonstrategic assets to be run off or sold implementing and completing this plan is expected to take a considerable amount of time and attention of management and staff as they work to identify negotiate and execute upon opportunities to reposition the loan portfolio divest certain assets and effect potential transactions it is possible that the process of diversifying the companys loan portfolio could result in substantial disruption of the companys business and operations as the company may face the unexpected loss of key employees that it relies on to assist with the transition or to work on the companys continuing operations disruption of its ongoing businesses higher than anticipated costs adverse impacts to its relationships with its customers and employees or a failure to achieve the anticipated benefits andor cost savings if difficulties with diversifying the companys loan portfolio are encountered the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected the process of diversifying the companys loan portfolio will also divert management attention and resources and could have an adverse effect on the companys ability to operate efficiently as well as its results of operations and financial condition during the transition period and beyond the process of effecting the run off or sale of nonstrategic or other assets of the company could also result in substantial disruption of the companys business and operations for similar reasons as stated above further for any sales or divestitures of assets the companys ability to effect such divestiture or sale will depend upon various factors such as the companys ability to identify interested counterparties counterparties willingness to negotiate and enter into transactions with the company the potential of required regulatory approvals associated with such divestitures and the prices and other terms upon which any counterparty would be willing to transact with the company no assurances can be made that the company will be able to enter into or complete any sale or divestiture of any assets or that the failure to do so may have a negative impact on the companys business operations liquidity and financial condition
