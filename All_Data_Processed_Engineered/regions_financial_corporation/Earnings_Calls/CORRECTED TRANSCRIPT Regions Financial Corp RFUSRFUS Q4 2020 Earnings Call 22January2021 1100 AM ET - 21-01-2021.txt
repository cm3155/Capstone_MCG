dana and thank you for joining our call today let me begin by saying that we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and fullyear results we achieved a great deal despite a challenging interest rate and operating regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 environment earlier this morning we reported fullyear earnings of million reflecting our highest level of adjusted pretax preprovision income in more than a decade resulting in adjusted positive operating leverage of over the last 10plus years weve made significant strides toward our goal of positioning the company to generate consistent sustainable longterm performance weve enhanced our credit interest rate and operational risk management processes and platforms we sharpened our focus on appropriate riskadjusted returns and capital allocation these actions position us well to weather the economic downturn caused by the pandemic and to serve as a strong foundation for growth despite a year of unprecedented uncertainty we remain focused on what we can control and our efforts are paying off during we grew consumer and small business checking accounts by we increased corporate loan production by we made investments in talent target markets technology and digital capabilities and we expanded and enhanced products across the consumer and corporate bank incorporating changing customer preferences and learnings from the pandemic in and beyond we will continue to focus on growing our business by investing in areas that allow us to make banking easier for our customers and while continuing to provide our associates with the tools they need to be competitive we will make incremental adjustments to our business while leveraging our strengths and investing in areas where we believe we can consistently win over time we did this by adding mortgage loan originators when rates were still rising positioning us to better capitalize on mortgage activity we also expanded our small business platform through the ascentium acquisition as well as our enhanced sba technology platform in closing were very proud of our achievements in but none of these will be possible without the hard work and dedication of our associates this year has posed a myriad of challenges however our associates took action providing bestinclass customer service successfully executing on our strategy and maintaining strong risk management practices in the face of a rapidly evolving operating environment all of which contributed to our success now dave will provide you with some details regarding the quarter david jackson turner senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thank you john lets start with the balance sheet while adjusted average loans were up for the year they decreased in the fourth quarter new and renewed commercial loan production increased compared to the third quarter however balances remain negatively impacted by historically low utilization levels as of yearend commercial line utilization was just under compared to historical average of commercial loan balances were further impacted by the companys active portfolio management efforts during the quarter approximately million worth of commercial loans were either sold or transferred to held for sale additionally ppp forgiveness began during the quarter resulting in a million reduction in average loan balances consumer loan growth again reflected strong mortgage production offset by runoff portfolios overall we expect adjusted average loan balances to be down by lowsingledigits compared to however after excluding the impact of this quarters portfolio management efforts we expect adjusted ending loans to grow by lowsingledigits regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 with respect to deposits balances continued to increase this quarter to new record levels fullyear average deposits are higher than with most of the growth coming in noninterestbearing to core operating accounts across all three business segments the increase was primarily due to higher balances however we are also experiencing new account growth we expect nearterm deposit balances will continue to increase particularly as the second round of stimulus is dispersed lets shift to net interest income and margin which remain a significant source of stability for regions net interest income increased during the quarter and as expected remained relatively stable excluding the benefit from ppp forgiveness similar to prior quarters the impact from lower loan balances and low longterm rates was mostly offset by our cash management strategies lower deposit costs and higher average notional values of active loan hedges net interest margin was stable linked quarter at deposit growth drove cash we hold at the federal reserve to record levels averaging over billion and reducing fourth quarter margin by basis points ppp benefited net interest income through the realization of approximately million of fees related to forgiveness in total the ppp program contributed basis points to the margin excluding excess cash and ppp our normalized net interest margin remained stable at evidencing our proactive balance sheet management despite a near zero shortterm rate environment loan hedges added million to net interest income and basis points to the margin higher average hedge notional values drove a million increase compared to the third quarter our last four starting hedges began earlier this month so going forward we expect roughly million of hedge related interest income each quarter at current rate levels until hedges begin to mature in late our hedges have a remaining life of four years and provide protection through we continue to look for opportunities to deploy excess cash balancing risk and return of note incremental securities currently come with larger premiums which increased our quarterly premium amortization run rate but that is factored into the overall net benefit total premium amortization was million this quarter and would be in the low million range excluding booked premium increases and elevated ginnie mae buyout activity interestbearing deposit costs fell basis points in the quarter to basis points contributing million to net interest income looking ahead to the first quarter ppprelated net interest income is expected to be relatively stable with the fourth quarter however the timing of ppp loan forgiveness and participation in the second round of funding remains uncertain fewer days will reduce first quarter nii by roughly million after levelsetting for days net interest income is expected to be modestly lower quarteroverquarter mostly attributable to lower average loan balances the impact of lower longterm rates will continue to be offset by the benefits from hedging cash management strategies and lower deposit costs now lets take a look at fee revenue and expense adjusted noninterest income increased quarterover quarter we achieved record capital markets income driven primarily by increased ma activity mortgage delivered another solid quarter and for the full year generated record production and related revenue looking ahead to we expect mortgage and capital markets to continue to be significant contributors to fee revenue excluding the impact of cvadva we expect capital markets to generate quarterly revenue in the million to million on average service charges increased but remain below prior year levels while improving we believe changes in customer behavior as well as continued enhancements to our overdraft practices and transaction postings are likely to keep service charges below prepandemic levels although we expect the impact regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 of these changes will be partially offset by continued account growth we estimate service charges will grow but remain approximately to below levels card and atm fees have recovered compared to the prior year driven primarily by increased debit card spend and while credit card spend continues to improve it remains slightly behind prior year levels given the timing of interest rate changes in combined with exceptionally strong fee income performance we expect adjusted total revenue to be down modestly compared to the prior year but this will be dependent on the timing and amount of ppp forgiveness and loan growth please move on to noninterest expense adjusted noninterest expenses increased in the quarter driven by higher incentive compensation related primarily to record capital markets activities although base salaries were lower compared to the third quarter as we remain focused on our continuous improvement process associate head count decreased quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear and excluding the impact of our ascentium acquisition the associate head count decreased over in we will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology products and people to grow our business in we expect adjusted noninterest expenses to remain stable to down modestly compared to we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time but acknowledge will be challenging without a stronger economy than currently anticipated from an asset quality perspective overall credit continues to perform better than expected annualized net chargeoffs were basis points a 7basis point improvement over the prior quarter reflecting improvement primarily within our commercial portfolios nonperforming loans total delinquencies and business services criticized loans all remained relatively stable our allowance for credit losses declined basis points to of total loans and of total nonaccrual loans excluding ppp loans our allowance for credit losses was of total loans the decline in reserves reflects stabilization in our economic outlook and improved credit performance charge offs previously provided for and the impact of active portfolio management the allowance reduction resulted in a net million benefit to the provision our yearend allowance remains one of the highest in our peer group as measured against periodend loans or stress losses as modeled by the federal reserve as we look forward we are mindful of the uncertainty that exists in the economy due to the pandemic however we are cautiously optimistic as we move beyond events before the source of uncertainty in prior quarters further reductions in the allowance will depend on the timing of chargeoffs and greater certainty with respect to the path of the economic recovery while chargeoffs can be volatile quartertoquarter we currently expect fullyear net chargeoffs to range from basis points to basis points additionally based on what we know today we continue to expect chargeoffs to peak in mid2021 with respect to capital our common equity tier ratio increased approximately basis points to an estimated inside of our current operating range of to in the near term we intend to operate at the higher end of this range so wrapping up on the next slide are our expectations which we have already addressed so in summary we are cautiously optimistic about pretax preprovision income remains strong expenses are well controlled credit quality is showing resilience capital and liquidity are solid and we are optimistic on the prospect for the economic recovery to continue in our markets with that were happy to take your questions regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions your first question is from erika najarian of bank of america john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning good morning david the first one is for you as we think about total adjusted revenue how should we expectations how should we think about what youre thinking about ppp participation and also whether or not loans originated in ppp are going to be forgiven in and the second part of that question is you have seven times as much cash as you did a year ago a quarter year ago and also what your expectations are for where those cash levels level out in david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp okay well good morning let me start with ppp so we originated about billion worth of ppp loans this year now the rules were changing early on as you know and some of our customers actually gave us money back before we really earned much yield on it so at the end of the year as you can see on our page in the supplement ppp loans amount to billion at december we forgave approximately billion worth of loans in and that was really in the fourth quarter where we generated from the forgiveness piece alone million that we disclosed to you as we think about ppp we estimate at least at this time that wed originate approximately billion in ppp loans now the timing and the ultimate amount of that is uncertain as is the forgiveness with the existing billion so weve given you the pieces that you can do some scenario analysis in terms of how you think that may come into income clearly loans that are forgiven quicker come into and would help from a revenue standpoint your second piece of the question is on cash so youre right we do have quite a bit of cash our deposit growth was quite strong during the year both in consumer and wealth and also in the corporate banking group so all three of those had indiscernible growth we have deployed some of that cash in the securities book as youve seen and we have gotten a little bit of steepening of late the problem is mortgage spreads have tightened out of the way and therefore you really dont have a great place to put the cash and were reluctant to take on duration risk at this time now that being said we are mindful of more stimulus could steepen out even further which would give us a better entry point to put that cash but until we see that we really are going to have that cash at the fed earning basis points which we understand does weigh on our revenue but we think thats the most prudent path erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 got it and my second question is for john kudos to you and your team for trading at times tangible book in the middle of a global pandemic really speaks to the balance sheet management and the expense management that your team has executed im wondering as you emerge from this crisis stronger what your thoughts are on using that currency for inorganic opportunities john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp erika our point of view on that really hasnt changed we want to continue to look for opportunities to make nonbank acquisitions to expand our capabilities to help us grow and diversify our revenue we think the acquisitions that weve made over the last few years have proven to be fruitful as evidenced by over the last few years have proven to be fruitful as evidenced by as an example the great quarter that we had in capital markets largely driven by ma activity we also had a good quarter in lowincome housing tax credits and syndications of that business ascentium capital were excited about what we think it can mean for the future so thats our primary focus with respect to bank acquisitions our view of that about that hasnt changed we think we have a really solid plan if we continue to execute our plan continue to build a consistently performing sustainable business that over time we will continue to benefit from generating nice returns for our shareholders our currency will get stronger and if an opportunity comes along in the future we would then have an opportunity to consider it but our focus is on executing our plan erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch great thank you gentlemen operator your next question is from ken usdin of jefferies david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning guys just a followup on the loan side you give us that nice adjusted number and reconciliation in the back but just wondering if you can help us understand also underneath that the auto book and the runoff thats still happening and the portfolio loan sale that you called out so it looked like that averaged about ph billion the auto stuff in and what you think thats going to look like as you look forward into david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well i think again if you go back to that youre referring to page in the supplement and we really want to levelset because our point is if you kind of cut to the core of our business we think endtoend we can grow loans we said wed grow lowsingle digits but well still were going to continue to have the pace of runoff that you see there with regards to our exit portfolios you can see just in the quarter we were down some million on indirectother and we were down about million on vehicles and we see that pace continuing that will regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 weigh on total loans but were trying to see the message our core business were in great markets we expect there to be somewhat of a rebound but itll be towards the back half ph the amount of which really is dependent on the economic recovery ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah understand and thats exactly what i was going to follow up david as you look through the commercial books where would you expect that to be seen the most in terms of that economic recovery starting to show up in that regular way loan book thanks david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah i think a big part of that is going to be in things like healthcare and would be a big one financial services elements of manufacturing we think are also capable of growing those will be three areas that we would really point to at this time ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it and the second question just on the expenses youve guys done a very good job holding the line on the cost curve keeping it close to flat some of the peers are starting to talk about extra investments and fronting of things that might have come over time just wanted to hear how you guys are strategically thinking about that are you putting in enough as you save to keep flat and how do you think about that strategically as you go forward thanks david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so again weve been pretty consistent with our message on investments weve invested in people so mortgage loans originators is an example wealth advisors being another one weve had relationship managers we have to continue to make investments in the people side there we continue to make investments in technology and cyber and digital we have to keep doing that to serve our customers we also are cognizant of the fact that when revenue is challenged we have to figure out how to pay for that so that we can keep our expenses relatively stable to down as were indicating so what we do is we look at things like our head count its of our costs we look at occupancy costs we look at thirdparty vendors furniture fixtures and equipment weve been really good at keeping that cost down and were going to continue to focus on it through our continuous improvement program in those same areas in ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood thanks david david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thank you operator your next question is from jennifer demba of truist securities regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc good morning just curious about the loan loss reserve and where you see that going over the course of do you think this would go back to your day one people reserve level or do you think that might occur more in david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah its a great question and theres a lot of uncertainty with regards to that you could see our slide that we have thats on page of our deck where we break out the component parts of where the reserve is moving jennifer theres still uncertainty with regards to the economic recovery as evidenced by the federal government stimulus program so we need to see more certainty with regards to where we think losses will ultimately be we think theres a risk that those have been just pushed out a bit that theyre still there and until we have clarity that theyre not were going to keep the reserves at an appropriate level we are mindful of the fact that timing of chargeoffs matter on the reserves the macroeconomic factors which we have to measure every quarter end is important to us and so we think ultimately we can get there when times are good im not confident we are not confident that that can happen in and the pace of reserves coming down again will be dependent on the things i just mentioned jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks dave operator your next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning john good morning david how are you guys john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good thank you david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp good morning regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good maybe we could start off david you guys had an interesting slide in the deck at the back of the deck on the libor transition the question i have for you is do you think theres any possibility of that drop dead date being pushed out from the end of the year and then second when you look at that slide what are the top two or three risks that youre focused on to ensure that theres a smooth transition here david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well so to answer your first part of that question is there is a chance that all this gets pushed out a bit i think what most people are finding is that this is much more difficult than just changing an index it so it permeates a lot of our business obviously our loan book but our derivatives book and how we transition is really important how we get our systems updated is a risk that we have to be mindful of from a competitive standpoint what index will our customers prefer to go to and we deal with large customers and we deal with middle market and small business customers and a lot of our competitors may use a different index and so we need to transitioning in that front will be important for us we need to see the term structures continue to develop so that we can effectively hedge our interest rate risk without having basis risk at the same time so a lot of contracts its just a big body of work gerard and having more time would be helpful gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and john a bigger picture for bigger question big picture question i should say for you is that regions obviously your quarter was quite strong your peers are putting up good numbers as well the industry appears to be positioned to benefit from this economic recovery that many people are forecasting thats tied to the vaccine rollout can you share with us when you go down the elevator at night what are the risks that you think about as you look out over the next to months that you dont want to lose sight of john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp well as i would say to our team every day we cant take anything for granted and we continue to see improvement in our business weve done a great job i think over the last plus months working through a very challenging environment the industry has done a great job were still confronting a number of crises across the country whether they be healthrelated the economy the political environment were operating in social unrest all those things potentially impact our business and so we cant take anything for granted weve got to continue to focus on the risks in our business make sure that we are executing well that were continuing to recruit our talent internally and externally every day to keep an engaged and active team and i think if we do those things and stay focused on the things that we can control which are how we take care of our customers how we respond to each other its about the investments that we make in technology and in our business if we do those things then i think were doing a good job of managing the risks that are in our business and well deliver that consistent sustainable longterm performance its about really focusing on what we can control gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 operator your next question is from betsy graseck of morgan stanley john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi i just wanted to dig in a little bit on the nco guide of basis points to basis points for and just kind of understand how to think about the trajectory among the different asset classes because consumer tends to be fairly mechanistic with the day calendar roll but ci and cre are obviously a little bit more at your discretion so maybe you can give us a sense as to how we should anticipate the cadence throughout the year goes john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah so i think as weve guided to basis points to basis points and that we believe chargeoffs will peak in the first half of the year thats really a reflection of the fact that our view is weve got some corporate bank or commercial wholesale credits whether theyd be typical ci or invest in real estate to work through in the first half of the year on the other hand consumer which has performed exceptionally well we think will continue to exhibit really good credit quality particularly with the additional stimulus pumped into the economy and so if chargeoffs rise in the consumer sector thats likely to be in the second half of the year is the way we think about it betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then these chargeoffs are youve already reserved for them so we should anticipate a release to manage the chargeoffs as they come through david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah i think you got a really that word release has always bothered me but the reserve should go down because of chargeoffs and then the question is how much do you need in reserves for the remaining portfolio and so if your portfolio of loans isnt growing and the credit quality isnt changing and the macroeconomic factors arent changing then you wouldnt reprovide because the theory is you already did that and so thats as straightforward as i know how to make it regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc do you like the word match better david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp no betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc but basically what youre saying is david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp my point i dont mean to be flippant but my point is those are two independent thoughts chargeoffs are charge offs then you settle down and you figure out what your reserve needs to be under cecl and you cant think of it in the context of the old accounting thats what im trying to get everybody to rethink betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc are you suggesting though that the economy is getting better you should have reserve release ahead of the net chargeoff recognition and thats also another possibility david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thats absolutely right thats why i would give you the analysis we did on that page to show you what the moving parts are on analyzing the reserve you got chargeoffs you got the change in outlook and then you have other qualitative factors and model considerations that you have to consider so youre absolutely right if the economic outlook continues to get better then you would expect not to need the reserves that you booked and thats a true release betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and when are you making those reserve decisions is that at the end of the quarter like december or is that something youre doing earlier in the quarter david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well we have our teams this is what they do every day and but were its incumbent upon us every balance sheet date to look at the facts that exist at that point in time and make our ultimate determination so yeah as you remember in the first quarter of last year one week to the next week was dramatic shifts in the macroeconomic environment so you cant make a call until you get to the end of a quarter betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 right okay and then just separately on cet1 i know your cet1 range that youve given is to and given that youre at currently how does that impact your decision on timing for repurchases can you give us a sense as to are you waiting until you hit and then commence or anywhere in that range is fair game david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well we said that for the near term thats our range were probably going to want to operate at the higher end of that range just because as we mentioned a minute ago uncertainty continues in the economy but is our number right now if we continue to accrete over that then we would be in position subject to the other regulatory tests that we have to have beginning to repurchase our shares as john mentioned earlier though we really want to use our capital to grow grow organically to grow do a nonbank transaction to pay an appropriate dividend but we will use share repurchases to keep ourselves at least today at that closer to that level and it could vary a bit just because of what happens right at month end but if we get clarity that maybe we dont need and its something lower than that then well readjust our share buyback based on our new capital number betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right thanks very much john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah operator your next question is from john pancari of evercore isi john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning good morning i appreciate the net interest income detail you gave in terms of outlook i just want to see if you can comment a little bit around the margin and how that could trend for your fullyear expectation and maybe into next quarter just given the liquidity dynamics as well as obviously the ppp dynamics thanks david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah john so i think from a margin standpoint we do have a little bit of an anomaly this first quarter we have a twoday change so itll hurt us by that million on nii but itll help the margin a little bit so you could see that go actually up a little bit but we think if you look at it in total for the year we think our margin will trend down into that range and then were talking about our core margin now excash and ppp we think the fullyear margin will be down about or basis points from where we are today and if we look at with cash and ppp we think well be down or basis points if we look at the full year number hopefully that helps you regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 john pancari q analyst evercore isi no that does that does thank you and then just on a competitive backdrop obviously weve seen lot of activity in terms of recent bank deals that are impacting the southeast and can you just talk about are you beginning to see any competitive strain show up either in loan pricing or other areas that were not as obvious even a year ago or so and then separately are you seeing opportunities potentially on talent or customer acquisition as a result of those deals there in your backyard thanks john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah i dont know that were necessarily seeing a change lets say in competition theres still a lot of competition because theres a tremendous amount of liquidity in the market so whether itd be bank competitors nonbank competitors when we see good opportunities theyre very competitive and in fact we recently lost a few what we would characterize as good opportunities to pretty aggressive pricing having said that again i wouldnt say thats a change as a result of new announcements in the marketplace bank combinations or anything of that nature its just people looking for opportunities to and particularly id say community banks in the middle market space looking to acquire assets and get some yield with regard to just disruption id say we feel like weve been able to recruit some really quality talent in the market and thats something that we stay focused on all the time so whether there is an announced bank transaction creating some disruption or a stable market our challenge to our team is to always be looking for the best talent in the markets that we operate in and we have through the pandemic i think added a number of bankers and senior leaders that we are excited about both in our customer facing businesses and in our staff functions and so id say talent acquisition has been good and we expect it will continue to be john pancari q analyst evercore isi well thank you thats helpful im sorry if i could ask just one more on the margin front would anything really what would change your view about potentially putting some of that excess liquidity to work in the bond portfolio i know you indicated a lack of interest there but would it only be a material move in rates beyond what weve seen or is there anything else that would make you put money to work thanks david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah i think thats the primary yeah if we could see a steepening effect occur where we have opportunities to well take a little bit of risk there if we continue to see deposit growth continuing to grow where we have even more cash than we have now could be an opportunity but again we really dont want to continue weve grown our securities book fairly strong compared to our peers now some have more cash than we do but were all trying to figure this out were all trying to figure out what type of risk we want to run and i think for us its just its more ratedriven than anything john john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks david regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 operator your next question is from dave rochester of compass point john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning so you guys have done a great job reducing higher cost borrowings in the last year i know there isnt much of that left but was just wondering if youre assuming any further reduction in those this year david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so your question is what have we done to reposition the liability management indiscernible john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp id say weve done a good job reducing higher cost borrowings do we have what are our thoughts about it are there any other opportunities david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so were running a little thinner today in terms of opportunities what we try to do is things that where we dont have liquidity value that we end up taking that out or call it because we have so much cash on hand we have some marginal opportunities that were looking at right now not as many as we had this past year we had a lot of calls were out of fhlb altogether i think it was over billion we called but theres some small opportunities still left that were going to continue to evaluate including things in the preferred stock arena too david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and then maybe just one quick one on the margin whats the rollonrolloff differential at this point in the loan book and then to the extent that youre buying securities to maybe keep the portfolio stable at this point i guess where are you guys seeing those yields currently david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well let me talk about it in total so we have about billion each year of cash flows we have to put to work and the front bookback book piece of that is about today its up a little bit it had been about its about now and so we think weve done a pretty good job through our liability management cash management strategies to neutralize rates even at the long end but i think of course we have our hedges on the short end so we think weve neutralized rates and our ability to really grow nii and the resulting margin is really going to be predicated on growing our loan book the size and mix and then the timing of the ppp program as mentioned earlier david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 great all right thanks guys david jackson turner a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thank you john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you operator your final question is from matt oconnor of deutsche bank john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey guys i just wonder if you could remind us the strategy in the capital market business obviously was very strong this quarter but couple quarters ago was also very strong so remind us the targeted customer and just how its integrated with the overall firm john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah so weve been investing in that business since made a couple of acquisitions to help build it been acquiring talent to help build out our capabilities and were really pleased with the progress that function was established to really help us leverage capital markets capabilities into our existing customer base and through the creation of some industry verticals also build a portfolio of new customer opportunities by again leveraging capital markets as a mechanism for acquiring new customers were doing that both in our commercial corporate banking business in particular and in our real estate business one of the very first acquisitions we made was of a fannie dus license and that real estate permanent placement business has been really solid we had another good quarter in the fourth quarter and expect that we will in the future so our objective is to combine our capital markets bankers working closely with our industry experts and our local bankers to deliver our capital markets capabilities whether it be debt placement our capitalraising activities ma derivatives foreign exchange all those things are accreting very nicely to us and helping us grow the capital markets business and our expectation is that well continue to see that as the business matures matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and i guess the commentary about it being in the million to million range in the near term here is there just kind of a conservative approach being taken on that or were there just a couple of lumpy things that really drove the outsized results in the quarter regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah we its the business is episodic it ebbs and flows and what we found is that over the last six years as weve been building it we sort of reach a point of equilibrium where we step up to the next level so to speak and so i think maybe a year to year and a half two years ago we were giving guidance said it was a million to million a quarter kind of business and now were increasing that guidance because we think theres more recurring sustainable revenue which will be complemented by the episodic revenue that things that happened that we werent anticipating that certainly was the case this quarter when we had a number of ma transactions that got completed prior to the end of the year pulled forward as a result of customers being eager to get something done in and so dont anticipate that for the second for the first quarter and we certainly dont plan on that in so weve guided to sort of a new level of what we would say as more likely consistent performance in that business matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it that was helpful thank you
