will provide some highlights regarding the quarter david j turner jr chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp thank you john lets start with the balance sheet average and ending loans decreased modestly on a sequential quarter basis while ending loans grew a little over compared to the prior year within the business regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 portfolio average and ending loans declined quarteroverquarter we are remaining judicious preserving capital for business where we can have a full relationship loan demand remains soft as clients continue to exhibit cautious behavior we are seeing clients make longterm investments when they have to but if they can defer theyre holding off in general sentiment varies across industries with some continuing to expect growth while others have a more muted outlook average and ending consumer loans remained relatively stable as growth in mortgage and enerbank was partially offset by declines in home equity and the greensky exit portfolio sale we completed this quarter looking forward we expect average loan growth to be in the low singledigits from a deposit standpoint deposits increased modestly on an average and ending basis primarily due to the increases in interestbearing business products which we expect will partially reverse with tax season in the first quarter across all three businesses we continued to experience remixing from noninterestbearing to interest bearing deposits however the pace of remixing has slowed within consumer we continue to see balance normalization but we believe the pace of remixing will continue to slow as shortterm market rates appear to have peaked and the relationship of checking balances to spending levels is getting closer to prepandemic levels our overall views on deposit balances and rates are unchanged we expect incremental remixing out of lowcost savings and checking products of between billion and billion and total balances stabilizing by midyear this results in a noninterestbearing mix percentage remaining in the low30 range so lets shift to net interest income net interest income declined by approximately in the quarter driven mostly by a deposit cost and mix normalization as well as the start of the active period on billion of incremental hedging asset yields benefited from the maturity and replacement of loweryielding fixed rate loans and securities notably during the quarter weve returned to full reinvestment of paydowns in the securities portfolio and added million over and above that to the portfolio balance taking advantage of attractive market rate and spread levels interestbearing deposit costs were in the quarter representing a rising rate cycle beta growth in higher cost corporate deposits increased our reported deposit betas by approximately but allowed for the termination of all outstanding fhlb advances this and a more pronounced slowing in the pace of rateseeking behavior by retail customers drove modest net interest income outperformance compared to expectations as we look to we expect net interest income trends to stabilize over the first half of the year and grow over the back half of the year billion of additional forward starting hedges in the first quarter and further latecycle deposit remixing will be a headwind however we expect deposit trends to continue to improve with interest bearing betas peaking in the mid40 range the benefits of fixed rate asset turnover will persist overcoming the headwinds and driving net interest income growth in the second half of the year with respect to outlook we expect fullyear net interest income to be between billion and billion our guidance assumes four basis point rate cuts with longterm rates remaining stable from yearend however the path for net interest income is wellinsulated from changes in market interest rates the primary driver of net interest income in will be deposit performance the lower end of our expected net interest income range assumes a beta as rates fall while the higher end assumes a deposit beta similar to what we have experienced during the rising rate environment regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 in a falling rate environment we are prepared to manage deposit costs lower to protect the margin a relatively small portion of interestbearing deposit balances is responsible for the majority of the deposit cost increase this cycle these market price deposits include indexed and other high beta corporate deposit types that will reprice immediately with fed funds the other primary contributor is cds with a sevenmonth average maturity while these products will lag in a falling rate environment we are positioned to offset this cost so lets take a look at fee revenue and expense adjusted noninterest income increased during the quarter as a sequential decline in capital markets was offset by modest increases in most other categories fullyear adjusted noninterest income declined primarily due to reductions in capital markets and mortgage income as well as the impact of the companys overdraft grace feature implemented late in the second quarter partially offsetting these declines were new records in for both treasury management and wealth management revenue with respect to outlook we expect fullyear adjusted noninterest income to be between billion and billion lets move on to noninterest expense reported noninterest expense increased compared to the prior quarter but included two significant adjusted items million for the fdic special assessment and million in severancerelated costs adjusted noninterest expense decreased driven primarily by lower operational losses fullyear adjusted noninterest expense increased or approximately excluding elevated operational losses experienced primarily in the second and third quarters we remain committed to prudently managing expenses to fund investments in our business we will continue focusing on our largest expense categories which include salaries and benefits occupancy and vendor spend we expect fullyear adjusted noninterest expenses to be approximately billion from an asset quality standpoint overall credit performance continues to normalize as expected reported annualized net chargeoffs for the fourth quarter increased basis points however excluding the impact of the greensky loan sale adjusted net chargeoffs decreased basis point versus the prior quarter to basis points fullyear adjusted net chargeoffs were basis points total nonperforming loans and business services criticized loans increased during the quarter nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans increased to basis points due primarily to downgrades within industries previously identified as higher risk keep in mind between and our average npl ratio was basis points we expect to see further normalization towards these levels in provision expense was million or million in excess of net chargeoffs and includes an million net provision expense related to the consumer loan sale the allowance for credit loss ratio increased basis points to excluding the loan portfolio sold during the quarter the allowance for credit loss ratio would have increased basis points the increase to our allowance was primarily due to adverse risk migration and continued credit quality normalization as well as higher qualitative adjustments for incremental risk in certain higher risk portfolios our average net chargeoffs from to were basis points weve seen modest acceleration towards these normalized levels in recent quarters as a result we expect our fullyear net chargeoff ratio to be between basis points and basis points turning to capital and liquidity given the evolution of the regulatory environment we expect to maintain our common equity tier ratio around over the near term this level will provide sufficient flexibility to meet the proposed changes along the implementation timeline while supporting strategic growth objectives and allow us to regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 continue to increase the dividend commensurate with earnings we ended the year with an estimated common equity tier ratio of while executing million in share repurchases and million in common dividends during the quarter with that well move to the qa portion of the call question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thank you for taking the question appreciate the comments on the main levers for nii or within nii for your guidance i was hoping you could discuss a little more about the deposit repricing thoughts that you had maybe specifically thoughts about sort of the bifurcation between commercial and consumer deposits and then just any opportunities youve seen with the fed already having sort of peaked out presumably any opportunities youve had already to maybe take some actions to ease the pressure on costs david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp sure scott this is david one important thing to note is that about of our customer base is really the driver of our interestbearing deposit beta if you look at that little over half of thats related to our commercial book and those deposits are indexed so to the extent the fed changes rates those indiscernible that changes so youre talking about roughly almost of thatll come down as rates come down the other represents consumer deposits so these have been cds and money market accounts there where weve seen migration out of noninterestbearing accounts the money market piece both of these have to be competitive we have to watch what our competitors are doing to some degree but we have mechanisms to really start working that down part of that is making sure we dont go too long on our cd maturities so weve been fairly short i think i mentioned in the prepared comments our average cd term is seven months and so we dont want to extend that much going forward as a matter of fact wed like to shorten that to coincide with what we think is going to happen with the fed and we have four cuts baked in to our guidance to hit the midpoint of our guidance which is on page of our presentation and we think that starts probably at the may meeting and we know thats different than what the market participants believe but we think that thats going to i think its going to be slower versus faster its important to note were neutral to shortterm rates and so its all about managing our deposit costs and i think we have a good plan to do so weve given you really a range its a pretty tight range on nii performance on the page and weve kind of talked about betas so if our betas kind of follow what we had and as rates have gone up were today we said wed probably finish in the mid if we have that coming back down then well be at the upper end of our range if were only at beta as rates come down knowing things wont match perfectly then wed be at the lower end of the range so our midpoint is the beta which we think is very doable in particular relative to that half of that a little over half of that is related to indexed deposit on the commercial side regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect thanks for that color david and then maybe on the lending side you noted soft client demand which is very understandable just curious how you expect demand to trend as the year unfolds john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah scott this is john i would our current projections are we believe the economic activity picks up toward the second half of the year and we believe we will experience some growth in core middle market banking and small business banking through our ascentium platform assetbased lending which would be typical of this period of time and then on the consumer side mortgage and enerbank continue to contribute to growth again any growth we have will be modest and that will occur likely toward the back half of the year r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah perfect all right thank you all very much operator our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your question david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning just maybe wanted to follow up on the fee income guide maybe if we can drill into where do you see growth across fee revenue particularly on what are you assuming in there for capital markets it was a weakish fourth quarter so would love to hear outlook on capital markets income within fees and then do you expect to do more purchases for mortgage servicing rights as you did in the quarter and should that boost mortgage income thank you david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so your its david so your first point on capital markets we had a pretty tough capital markets finish in the fourth quarter bit of that is timing we think some deals in particular in the ma world got pushed into the first quarter the rate environment has really hampered our real estate corporate banking income line a bit we think those rebound both of those rebound we think ma can has a tendency a chance to pick up probably towards the back half of the year as weve seen a little bit of rate relief if you will so we have a pretty good feel about our capital markets rebound for relative to mortgage servicing rights as you know we have a good capital position we look to support our business to grow our loan book we think loan growth will be muted so we look to other ways to put the capital to work mortgage servicing rights has been one of those we feel good about that asset class because were good at it were the lowcost servicing group and were looking to grow when packages make sense and the economics work to our advantage weve done a number of those on the market if we can hit the mid that we regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 have to make sure we get an appropriate riskadjusted return well do that we suspect therell be a couple of opportunities during the year as there usually are but we have room to grow that without adding a lot of fixed overhead have to add people to do the servicing but we dont have to add a lot of fixed overhead john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah id just add two things ebrahim one is we continue to grow consumer checking accounts and consumer households that contributes to growth secondly weve had a had the best year we probably ever had in treasury management as we see increases in the number of operating accounts that we are that were originating and services were providing to customers and then finally wealth management had maybe the best year its had certainly in some time and we expect wealth management fee revenue to continue to grow in ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and just one other one david i guess the one flex on deposit pricing is your loantodeposit ratio at just give us a sense of is this steady state in somewhere in the mid to high where you see running the bank going forward or if rates get cut you could see this ratio drift into the and that probably provide you some pricing flexibility thank you david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so we really dont run the bank trying to solve for our loantodeposit ratio its just kind of result of all of our activities that we have at were a little bit lower than the peer median about points it gives us some flexibility to not have to put a lot of pressure on the deposit base remember my opening comments were we want to be fairly balanced with regards to our customers making sure that were competitive but we dont have to push we dont have to be at the upper end of pricing just to maintain those deposits we have a good core deposit base and it gives us flexibility to not have to chase with rate and thats why our deposit costs have a tendency to be a bit lower across the board ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc perfect thank you operator our next question comes from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please proceed with your question david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning i think you mentioned earlier on in the call that clients are deferring longer term investments if they can can you talk about whats driving that is it just rates and waiting for rates to come down is part of it the environment that they need more certainty there so any light on your conversations there would be helpful regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah i think probably all of the above clearly rising interest rates that have had some impact rising cost cost of goods cost of labor has had an impact and then uncertainty related to the economy geopolitical conditions the political environment here in the us all have i think created some restraint borrowers are i believe more optimistic today than they were to days ago and thats in line with what appear to be improving economic conditions but still reluctant to initiate longterm investments currently just based upon the things that i described manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc so as we think about deposit betas when rates go down i think you and a number of your peers have suggested that okay loan growth will accelerate as we get a resolution in some of these matters and as rates go down but then on the flip side does that mean that deposit competition picks back up im just trying to assess the level of confidence on the highend lowend of that range of that to down beta david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp well we still think loan growth for the year is going to be relatively muted and competition for deposits has always been fairly intense what you dont want to do is use rate you want to have a relationship banking model which is what we do we leverage off of the checking account of the consumer and the operating account of a business and with that comes all other type of funding for us we have no wholesale borrowings to speak of we paid off all of our fhlb advances so we have the ability to lever up there to cover incremental growth without having to reprice our deposit base so if theres incremental pressure or competition on deposit i dont think itll be all that meaningful for us in particular manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs please proceed with your question john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning ryan david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning john good morning david maybe a question on capital david in the slides you talked about maintaining youre over on an adjusted basis maybe just talk about how you think about uses of capital outside of loan growth i know we had some buyback this quarter i think in december we were talking regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 about the potential for a securities portfolio restructuring maybe just talk a little bit about how youre thinking about incremental uses of capital from here david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so obviously let me just go through the kind of checkpoints as we think about it so we want to use our capital to support loan growth thats going to be fairly muted as i mentioned we want to pay a fair dividend to of our earnings so we think thats covered we then have excess capital that we look to put to work in growing our business weve looked at mortgage servicing rights as i mentioned just a couple of calls ago and well continue to look for businesses that we think can help us grow we have talked about the securities repositioning we continue to evaluate that we have not made any decisions to do that just yet and outside of that we dont want our capital to get too far away from and the is pegged on the fact that we think were close enough with our ability to accrete capital every quarter to adapt to whatever the regulatory environment is going to be theres a lot of uncertainty with regards to what thats going to look like and theres no need for us to continue to ramp up capital to an unnecessary level and hurt our return we think were in an optimal spot to be able to maneuver and so we think the number is the right thing to do the right place to be ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it maybe to come at net interest income and net interest margin from a little bit of a different perspective you gave us guidance for the first quarter and nim is expected to be around for the full year maybe david indiscernible talk about how you see it evolving over the course of the year and when you look out as we think about the declining rate cycle where do you foresee the net interest margin settling out over time i know historically weve talked about a to range maybe just a little bit of color on where you see it settling out over the course of the next couple of years thank you david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so i think youre going to see that margin pressure in the a little bit in the first quarter and slightly in the second quarter the first quarter has another call it billion of receivefixed swaps thatll become effective thatll have some negative carry that hurts us a bit in the first quarter and then things start to change a bit beginning in the second quarter so literally like after the first month so i think youll see a little bit more of a movement in the first quarter and a tiny movement in the second and then we can start to rebound a bit where well finish we think for the year in the range i think as things settle down we had talked about to that was predicated on rates really going back down to the very low levels and thats the the purpose of our whole hedging strategy is because we have lower deposit costs than most everybody if were going to protect our margin we have to do it synthetically and so we have about billion in any given year of receivefixed swaps and some other derivatives to help us manage the net interest margin in the to range so youre likely over time to be kind of in the middle of that and we think that thats a possibility in time now things have to settle out and weve got to get deposit costs back to tie up with where rates are but we can probably exit the year in the range ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 thanks for the color david david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp okay operator our next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi please proceed with your question john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning john david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning on the operating leverage side i mean your guidance implies negative operating leverage unsurprisingly for but as you look at your trajectory on the revenue front your assumptions there combined with your expense expectations how do you view the likelihood of achieving positive operating leverage in and when do you expect that you could break into a more positive trajectory on a quarterly basis thanks david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp john so i have a tendency to look at it on an annual basis and youre right we cant generate positive operating leverage in primarily because of our outperformance in the first two quarters of where we were having above margin which is way above most everybody and so i think thats been acknowledged in the marketplace i do think we can get back in to generate positive operating leverage and well start trending there towards the back half of the year as we see us bottoming out in terms of net interest income and margin in the second quarter and then we can start to grow from there well see what the economy looks like well see what loan growth looks like we think that picks up a bit and we think the pressure on deposit betas start to go the other way and as i just mentioned we can exit with a little stronger margin so i think positive operating leverage towards the back half is a possibility john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp and definitely for john pancari q analyst evercore isi great regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp and were going to get there for john pancari q analyst evercore isi right right okay great thats helpful and then secondly around credit regarding the npa increase i know you flagged the downgrades the risk rating downgrades in some of the higher risk sectors maybe could you give us a little bit more color whether was it concentrated in any one sector was there a broader scrub of the loan book that you completed that led you to the multiple of the the multiple downgrades or is it just episodic and then i guess just separately can you just talk about the reserve i know youre building a bit here whats the outlook there as you continue to add from here thanks john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah id just say john with respect to the increase in npls weve called out portfolios that have been under some stress for a number of quarters now and what we saw in the quarter was some migration from criticized classified to nonperforming specifically in senior housing in transportation and warehousing transportation specifically and office and then additionally manufacturing of consumer discretionary items so that is and that was our expectation we have one large technology credit that moved in the third quarter that is episodic we believe and something that we can and believe we will manage through so when you look at the migration as we pointed out we are moving back to more traditional sort of historical levels of nonperforming loans which is somewhere between basis points to basis points to basis points i think maybe david said the average was basis points or basis points basis points david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp basis points john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp from sic to and weve guided to basis points to basis points of chargeoffs which we think is in line with our expectations for potential loss in the portfolio over time so i think we feel we have good insight into the credits that were managing as to why i would say the burden of increasing interest rates increasing cost cost of labor operating cost all of those things have had an impact specifically on the industries that weve historically now called out transportation senior housing office consumer discretionary now with respect to the allowance we have a process we follow and go through every quarter and i think we believe that we currently believe obviously that weve provided for potential losses in the portfolio over time unless we experienced growth in the portfolio paydowns in the portfolio some changes in outstandings in the portfolio or in economic conditions you can assume that our allowance is appropriate and likely wont change the trajectory of it will not change unless the economy changes regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp and the only other thing john on that would be if the risk ratings change then that up or down john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah right david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp that also impacts your provisioning or release of reserves so i had that point with the other two or three that john had mentioned john pancari q analyst evercore isi and david im sorry if i could just regarding that last point is the risk rating migration negatively assumed is it now assumed as part of your outlook just given where we are in this downturn david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah thats right you look at your reasonable and forecast period and think about where the credits are going if that changes though they go the other way that can cause you not have to provide anymore so weve provided what we think we need to have if things get better then you dont need the reserves that you put up and you can release those reserves if things get worse then you have to provide more generally loan growth is also a driver of having to add to the provision if your loans are going the other way then you dont need the reserves that you had set up for them so you can have a release related to that economic conditions got a little better in the fourth quarter than the third so that was a positive but netnet were continuing to look at the life of the loan and where thats going to go and we think we have appropriate reserves for losses that are there john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great makes sense thank you david david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yes operator our next question comes from the line of dave rochester with compass point please proceed with your question david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp good morning john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc on the nii guide i was just wondering how slide might change if we dont get those cuts youre factoring in for the year i know you mentioned youre neutral to those so maybe this range wouldnt change much just figured that might maybe change some of the deposit flow and beta assumptions in here and maybe some other stuff david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so we tried to put that in if you look at the lower box on the lower end of that we say stable that was trying to address exactly what your question is david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp so to the extent that were kind of where we are david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc that would fall within this range david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp thats right thats right david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp but at the lower end regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah got you and then for the billion to billion in the fixed rate loan production and the securities reinvestment you mentioned per year i was just curious what the breakdown of that was for securities and loans and what yields youre putting on today on both the securities reinvestment and new loan production just on average i know youve got many different categories on loans youre producing david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so i think in total the kind of the front book back book between those two is about to basis points of pickup if you look at that billion to billion sic billion about a quarter of thats related to securities that going on as front book back book pieces of call it basis points and loans front book back book are probably in the to basis points range david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great and then just on capital given your comments on cet1 targeting that unadjusted what does that mean for the pace of buybacks here is the fourth quarter pace a good one going forward for the next few quarters maybe and then as it relates to your adjusted cet1 ratio which is just over youve got here how are you thinking about where you want that to be over time as the new rates kick in david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp well one we dont know what the new rules are going to be david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc true david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp so we fully loaded it with to say to show you that that doesnt impact our stress capital buffer or our absolute minimum were in good shape there we just need to see where the rules come out and by the time all that happens aoci is going to be in a different spot than it is today assuming rates continue to come down a bit we saw a pretty big move in all of the peers with aoci this quarter from a capital standpoint we think is the right number what was the dana w nolan a executive vice president headinvestor relations regions financial corp the buyback pace david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp the buyback pace so again we use the buy back as our last mechanism to help us keep our common equity tier in that range and so the pace is do your favorite earnings expectation take out the dividend use a bit of that with a low singledigit loan growth and then the rest is either going to be buying mortgage servicing regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 rights or things of that nature and then we toggle with share repurchases so i dont want to comment on whether we stay on the pace because i end up getting you the earnings guidance thats a trick david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc understood all right thanks guys appreciate it john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp all right john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thanks operator our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please proceed with your question john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning gerard david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi john and hi david david can you share with us you guys have given us good detail on credit quality and john you pointed out that the nonperforming loan increase was to the sectors of your portfolio that youve already identified as being weak could we look at it another way and you give us good details on slides and on the leveraged portfolio and the shared national credit portfolio how are those portfolios holding up creditwise and when you think back to where we were a year ago i remember in many of the calls the word recession was used quite often in those calls were not hearing that on this fourth quarter earnings call from most or nearly all the banks so have these portfolios held up better than what you would have thought from a year ago john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp i would say yes gerard the leveraged portfolio is largely relationshipbased credit business those are banking relationships that we enjoy were close to those customers and weve been close to them throughout this period of elevated rates there was some risk as rates rose that we had that there may be some softness in the portfolio regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 but i think its performed well the same is true of our shared national credit book as we began to build the capital markets business to help us grow and diversify our revenue and to meet more customer needs we naturally then began to expand the size of our shared national credit book so that we could serve those customers that had need for those products and services and with that as you can imagine comes some tall tree risk singlename risk and while i mentioned earlier we have a technology credit thats fairly substantial thats an npl that is an example of a shared national credit exposure that we have good visibility into we think it has very limited risk of loss but still is a nonperforming loan but overall i would say just based upon the reflection on the performance of that book its been good weve enjoyed expanding relationships growing revenue from capital markets andor deposits treasury management that we enjoy with those customers and so i think weve been pleased with the performance of both the leveraged book and the shared national credit book gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then coming back to loans and i think david in your comments you talked about loan demand remains soft and youre looking for low singledigit growth for average loans in i know during our careers the shadow banking industry has continued its competition against the banks but it seems today theres more coverage of the private equity side getting into lending maybe greater than weve seen in years how are you guys competing against the private credit markets and at the same time are any of those private credit lenders customers of yours that you have to balance that relationship of a customer competing against you john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp we have a very modest exposure to private equity who then is were not lending to private equity to in turn lend into our customer base so if we have any exposure it would be very modest there separately we dont see private equity as a competitor necessarily within our core middle market customer base i asked ronnie smith the question the other day if he could name a customer that we lost to private credit and we cant think of one now it doesnt mean its not occurring in some of the markets that were in but by and large given our focus on the core middle market business and investment grade type shared national credit exposure were just not were not seeing private credit as a competitor today on the wholesale side now there are lots of competitors on the consumer side that were seeing in a variety of different ways

jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp good morning brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning so appreciate the guidance on expenses and expense control there but i did have a question on just an update on the technology modernization project and kind of what youre baking in for expenses in and if part of that other expense savings is related to maybe delaying some of that project until further use david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah brandon so weve given you our overall expense guide to be essentially flat after you carve out operational losses from the past year we continue to make investments in our business we called it r2 which is our transformation project in cyber and risk management consumer compliance a lot of investment in areas of the regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 bank that were looking to offset elsewhere our r2 project is coming along very well we spend anywhere depending on the year to of our revenue in terms of technology cost we dont expect that to change materially in the short term we continue to evaluate how we can better leverage technology and i think we have a lot of upside potential to leverage that in our business to continue to improve and to continue to take out manual steps manual processes and have a technology solution too so we think our investment in technology is the right thing to do and were going to have a modern core deposit platform in the nottoodistant future which we think will be a competitive advantage for us as well so anyway thats kind of the spending range if you will to for revenue brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and just to confirm no delays in the timing of that john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah no to answer your question specifically that project is on time and on budget no delays brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay okay and then i just had a followup on credit and particularly in senior housing just wanted to get more details as far as your exposure there what are you thinking as far as ultimate loss content and any protections from a credit loss perspective john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah were seeing improvement in the senior housing space notwithstanding the fact that we have a couple of credits were carrying as nonperforming generally occupancy rates are improving over time today weve got about million in im sorry million in million in nonperforming loans and reserves against those credits of about so i think we maybe provided information on slide in your deck but we are seeing improvement in senior housing as occupancy rates pick up and people become a little more comfortable with communal living again amongst that age group brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks for all the color john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yes operator our next question comes from the line of erika najarian with ubs please proceed with your question erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning one followup regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp hello erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc good morning one followup question dave i think very notable what you said to ryans line of questioning the exit rate for the net interest margin in the fourth quarter a lot of investors are now focused on that exit rate so im just wondering if i could ask you sort of what the component pieces is or are rather so unless youve changed anything on the in terms of adding swaps it seems like you do have billion of notional rolling off in the fourth quarter so i guess its a good guy you also mentioned a terminated swap gain in your 10q but you had like a forward look for four quarters wondering what that could be for and then more notably obviously you guys have said unequivocally that its the deposit assumptions thats really going to make a difference im wondering sort of what the speed is that youre assuming on that down beta especially if you think that the first rate cut i think you said it was in may david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so i think allin the big drivers that are controlling the deposit costs we do have a headwind of the billion notional forward starting swap in the first quarter and then were kind of in the run rate the terminated swaps are in the amortization already those arent the huge drivers i think after we get our headwind and if rates start to come down then like i said almost of our beta is associated with indexed deposits on the commercial side so theyll start to come down and you start then having the loan and security repricing the fixed maturity repricing adding basis points basis points that overwhelms that headwind towards the back end of the year and you get a little bit of loan growth in the back end all that helps you propel you to a much stronger fourth quarter finish than you have at the beginning of the year so i think if you really looked at what is the one big thing that you have to get done and its controlling the deposit costs and we do that through managing the beta as rates change like i said of it indexed the other is decisioning we have to make and that gets a be a little herkyjerky because as i mentioned some of thats money market that we can change pretty quickly the other is cds that were locked in today its seven months and as things renew this month next month and going forward were looking to be shorter rather than longer so that we are prepared to take advantage to reduce our deposit costs as rates come down erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc and a followup to that you mentioned to of that down beta will be coming from these indexed commercial deposits one of your peers made a differentiation between indexed and contractual yesterday and i guess just give us some sense of how much of that is contractual versus indexed and but really it sounds like youre confident that either way you can control that to the downside especially if as you said loan growth remains soft this year david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 yeah so when we say indexed were talking about its tied to fed funds when fed funds changes through the contract it changes automatically theres no theres not a contractual number locked in like effectively a cd its the day just like a loan thats based on sofr i mean sofr changes so does the loan rate that day and so thats what were talking about when we say indexed deposits erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it thank you john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you operator thank you our final question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed with your question david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp good morning matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning any updated thoughts on potential regulatory changes to the debit card interchange rate or overdraft fees and thinking about potential indiscernible to that david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp well the so debit interchange is going through a discussion to adjust that down as was written in the original law they had to revisit the cost associated with debit interchange to the extent that does get put into place thatll have a negative impact to us starting i think that was going to be kicking in in june so its about a half a year and based on our numbers thats about a million risk item to us in our nir relative to the overdrafts were a long way from knowing where that comes out if there are any changes and i think thats a john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp date that was mentioned john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2024 david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp that just hit the wire i think theres going to be a lot of discussion on that because were disappointed in that we think provision of liquidity to our customer base is really really important we do charge a fee for that but were paying an item for somebody and charging a fee and to the extent we return that item to where it was written our view is that entity is going to charge a fee and so its not helpful to not be able to provide liquidity to our customer base and so were hoping theres going to be further discussion on that point and i think itd be premature to really talk about the impact to od until we get further down the road john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then separately good to see the elevated check fraud came down as you expected and the outlook kind of implies that youre confident that youre past these issues i guess i just want to reconfirm that and then also just any meaningful changes that you made to address it and whether it showed up in expenses as well john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp i would just say that the countermeasures that weve put in place which include talent technology process changes all have been effective and we believe going forward the run rate will be million to million a quarter in operating losses and the expenses associated with those countermeasures are embedded in our run rate and in our projection for expenses for david j turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah we got to continue to be vigilant with regards to this just like we are with cyber so we have bad people attacking us as does every financial institution and we have to continue to stay ahead of it we feel good about what weve put in place but we are not sitting idle were continuing to push and challenge ourselves to get even better than we are today matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay perfect thats helpful thank you john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you okay operator is that the end of the calls operator yes i would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments john
