for the third quarter total revenue grew on a reported and adjusted basis as both net interest income and fee revenue regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 improved quarteroverquarter in fact almost every category within fee revenue experienced growth compared to the second quarter in line with the growth in revenue adjusted noninterest expense increased modestly quarteroverquarter average loans remained stable while ending loans declined slightly quarteroverquarter reflecting modest customer demand continued focus on client selectivity as well as further paydowns and credit resolutions in the portfolio in general sentiment among corporate customers remains cautiously optimistic despite recent interest rate cuts and the possibility of more customers are hesitant to make capital expenditures until the resolution of the election along with the greater economic and geopolitical ph certainty our focus remains on understanding our customers evolving needs and providing tailored solutions to ensure we are wellpositioned to support them when the time is right average deposits declined slightly while ending deposits remained stable during the quarter as deposit remixing trends have stabilized although certain portfolios within the corporate bank continued to experience stress overall our corporate and consumer customers remain healthy and our credit metrics have stabilized before wrapping up i want to take a moment to speak about the recent hurricanes helene and milton they were incredibly powerful storms and the impacted communities across our footprint faced difficult challenges as they begin the recovery process im extremely proud of the way our teams are responding to meet the needs of our customers fellow associates and communities affected regions has a long history of helping communities through challenging times including natural disasters and well continue to support the recovery efforts in summary were proud of our third quarter results driven by the successful execution of our strategic plan our highly desirable footprint along with the investments were making in talent in technology and in products and services are positioning us to benefit as macroeconomic conditions improve we have a great plan and a leadership team with a proven track record of successful execution were on track for a strong finish to and are wellpositioned to continue generating top quartile results in and beyond now david will provide some highlights regarding the quarter david jackson turner chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp thank you john lets start with the balance sheet average loans remained stable while ending loans declined slightly on a sequential quarter basis within the business portfolio average loans remained stable quarterover quarter as john mentioned pipelines are likely to remain soft as customers continue to seek more certainty on a handful of fronts in addition customers continue to carry excess liquidity and utilization rates remain below historic levels average consumer loans also remained stable as modest growth in credit card was offset by declines in other categories we continue to expect average loans to be stable to down modestly compared to from a deposit standpoint deposit balances followed the expectations this quarter ending levels were stable and averages were down about largely due to normal summer spending among consumers competitive rates declined in advance of the fed rate cut and consequently customer demand for cds softened further slowing the rate seeking behavior we experienced throughout the cycle as a result the percentage of noninterest bearing deposits remained stable in the low30 range regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 lets shift to net interest income net interest income increased linked quarter outperforming our expectations the increase reflects stability in deposit trends together with asset yield expansion yeartodate we have repositioned billion of securities realizing million of pretax losses resulting in an estimated year payback this includes incremental sale and reinvestment of approximately billion of securities in the third quarter at a million pretax loss importantly the strategy of selling shorterduration and buying longerduration securities has been helpful in maintaining our duration target and has benefited the unrealized loss on the portfolio as interest rates moved lower in the third quarter going forward we will continue to evaluate further repositioning with respect to risk management and capital goals however nearterm opportunities with attractive payback periods are limited given current market dynamics similar to the second quarter transaction the proceeds of billion september debt issuance were used to purchase a like amount of securities in order to maintain a relatively neutral balance sheet position and bolster liquidity as expected interestbearing deposit costs have peaked remaining flat with the second quarter level at this completes the full rising rate cycle with our interestbearing deposit beta finishing at while also maintaining more deposit balances than held prior to the pandemic once again highlighting the funding advantage of regions industry leading deposit franchise now as we transition to a falling rate environment hedging and the ability to reduce deposit expense result in a wellprotected profile following the initial fed funds decline weve experienced a reduction in interestbearing deposit rates and our exit rate for the quarter amounted to consistent with a roughly beta in the fourth quarter we would expect further benefit from deposits as term products begin to mature and price lower equating to a mid beta and neutral sensitivity position in the quarter over time we believe falling rate deposit betas have the ability to drift higher toward those experienced in the rising rate cycle when coupled with fixed rate asset turnover at higher market yields this provides the support to grow net interest income in the fourth quarter and beyond lets take a look at fee revenue performance during the quarter adjusted noninterest income increased driven by improvement in almost every category most notably service charges capital markets and wealth management service charges increased driven primarily by treasury management semiannual fees as well as the benefit of one additional business day in the quarter capital markets increased due to the increase in ma advisory fees as well as an increased securities underwriting and placement fees driven by market stabilization over time and in a more favorable interest rate environment we expect our capital markets business can consistently generate quarterly revenue of approximately million but we expect it will run around million to million in the fourth quarter wealth management increased to a new quarterly record reflecting increased sales activity and stronger markets based on yeartodate results we now expect full year adjusted noninterest income to be in the billion to billion range lets move on to noninterest expense adjusted noninterest expense increased compared to the prior quarter driven primarily by a increase in salaries and benefits resulting from one additional day in the quarter increased performance based incentives and the impact of hrrelated asset valuations the company also recognized million of expense during the quarter associated with visas ongoing litigation escrow related to their class b shares regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 we remain committed to prudently managing expenses to fund investments in our business we will continue focusing on our largest expense categories which include salaries and benefits occupancy and vendor spend based on yeartodate results including outperformance in revenue and elevated hr asset valuations we now expect full year adjusted noninterest expenses to be approximately billion regarding asset quality as john indicated overall credit performance continued to stabilize during the quarter and importantly our results include the impact of the recently completed snc exam provision expense was million less than net chargeoffs at million and the resulting allowance for credit loss ratio increased basis point to as expected net chargeoffs as a percentage of average loans increased basis points to basis points driven primarily by large information credit and one office credit nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans declined basis points to basis points and business services criticized loans declined million we continue to expect full year net chargeoffs to be towards the upper end of our to basis point range attributable to a few large credits within our previously identified portfolios of interest however those losses are substantially reserved for lets turn to capital and liquidity we ended the quarter with an estimated common equity tier ratio of while executing million in share repurchases and million in common dividends during the quarter when adjusted to include aoci common equity tier increased meaningfully from to an estimated from the second to the third quarter the improvement reflects the benefit of aoci from lower interest rates and our active management of the duration of the securities portfolio additionally near the end of the third quarter we transferred billion of availableforsale securities to heldto maturity as an initial step to reduce the volatility of aoci as we transition towards new regulatory expectations in the future we expect to maintain our reported common equity tier ratio consistent with current levels over the near term this level will provide meaningful capital flexibility going forward to meet proposed and evolving regulatory changes along with the implementation timeline while supporting strategic growth objectives and allowing us to continue to increase the dividend and repurchase shares commensurate with earnings with that well move to the qa portion of the call regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions please hold while we compile the qa roster thank you our first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co morning everybody good morning thank you for taking the question david i was hoping you could sort of touch on some of the nuance within nii momentum and i guess ill ask just the first and then a followup question all kind of wrapped into one i think youve previously suggested the margin could push up closer to like as we enter next year and then kind of advance from there over the next couple of years it feels like the fourth quarter might take a little bit of a step back does that knock us off the track for the and prior path and then the follow on is regardless it still feels as if nii will remain on an upward trajectory so any updated thoughts on how the pacing looks over the next few periods david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp sure yes scott i think the were still intact with regards to that i do think well be in the in the lower part of the in the fourth quarter were going to grow a little bit in terms of nii as indicated and then going into we still have benefit from the front book back book thats going to benefit us weve had a little bit of earning asset growth too and continuing to control our deposit cost and of course we have our derivatives that naturally reset those are a negative carry this past quarter of about million and so as rates come down that certainly helps offset lowering rates so it gives us confidence that we can go into next year and grow the margin r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you very much i appreciate it david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp youre welcome operator our next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore please proceed with your question john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp morning john regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning just first on the loan growth side i guess if you could just give us a little more color what youre seeing in terms of loan demand i know you indicated that utilization is running below historical levels and given that what do you see as the catalyst really to be driving a material pickup and maybe how do you think about that pickup materializing when you look at either fourth quarter or thanks john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp yeah so weve said our customers are cautiously optimistic i would say the environments generally a positive one the economy is still good though slowing weve seen some growth in middle market commercial in our energy portfolio and assetbased lending some of that is offset by declines in the real estate book as projects are maturing and particularly in the multifamily space paying off which offsets some of the growth were experiencing on the business side weve had a little growth in credit card balances and in our interbank originations thats somewhat offset by declines in mortgages we experienced and some paydowns there so i think activity is okay pipelines are softer than they were last quarter but we still feel like we will see some modest possibly growth in loans in as theres more certainty about the political environment as theres more certainty about the continued direction of the economy prices begin to moderate a bit businesses are still doing well balance sheets are strong margins are compressing but customers are still making good money and we think theyll want to invest in their business when its more clear we see have a more clear path in later in david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah john its david i would add that our expectation is for real gdp to be in the little over range in we obviously are in great markets and we think we can take advantage of those when the a little bit of this uncertainty that john just mentioned dissipates a bit and then get on the growth trajectory in john pancari q analyst evercore group llc great thank you for that and then separately on the expense side can you maybe talk about your confidence in your upwardly revised expense expectations here i guess barring the outperformance of revenue on the fee side do you see other risks that could pressure expenses higher again beyond revenue related and then how does that influence your expectation for a positive operating leverage next year david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp sure no once you get to this close to the year the expense estimate were pretty tight on that we just dont see anything that can take us out of the what weve given you from an estimate standpoint and were set up weve done a good job of managing our expenses its an everyday thing for us we continue to look at expense savings opportunities because we want to use some of those savings to reinvest in our business to continue to grow which sets us up for growth in and yes we will generate positive operating leverage in so we kind of dont see anything thats really could create major uncertainty in the fourth quarter in particular regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp yeah our largest expense are obviously salary and benefits and thats controllable as we time the investments that were making we have a big technology project underway as you know we believe that project is on track on budget and so dont have a lot of concern about that at the moment either john pancari q analyst evercore group llc great thank you appreciate it john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp yes operator our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your question john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i guess first question around credit i think david you mentioned the chargeoffs towards the higher end sectors youve talked about just maybe if we look forward given where the economy today is where your customer base is do you think that chargeoffs remain sticky in that to bps range or do we actually see a stair step function decline at some point over the coming quarters john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp yeah ebrahim we look back at our historic performance its been kind of an average of basis points of chargeoffs prior to the pandemic and weve indicated we think based upon the composition of our portfolio that our chargeoffs will range somewhere between and basis points on average there may be a quarter where theyre modestly higher because of large exposures maybe a quarter where theyre lower because of better performance particularly in the business portfolio but we are seeing really good consumer credit performance right now and feel good about that and again based upon the composition of our portfolio and our historical performance we think that to basis point range is pretty typical ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood and i guess just one question maybe for david around deposit pricing im just wondering did the signaling by the fed with the first basis point rate cut give enough ammunition to actually flex deposit costs lower even if assuming we dont get a november cut or do you think every incremental rate cut is much needed in order to be able to bring deposit costs lower regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp no i think you should continue to expect the deposit costs to decline into the fourth quarter we have several things working some maturing cds that are in that range going on today closer to we had an exit rate we put in the script interestbearing cost being so if you look at where we were for the quarter it was so that gives you the indication you should continue to see the benefit of that coming down even if we dont get another cut now obviously more cuts would be even further reduction in costs but you also have to factor in the reinvestment yields on the asset side too so we think were wellpositioned back to the first question that we got from scott in terms of the nii we think we can continue to grow nii and the resulting margin in the fourth quarter and into ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of erika najarian with ubs please proceed with your question erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp morning erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc morning david im sorry for another question on deposit repricing im wondering if you could give us a sense of the cadence over the next several quarters so obviously some of the maturing retail and indexed deposits will reprice more immediately how should we think about once the easy stuff has repriced how we can look forward to deposit repricing going forward and maybe think us through if we havent seen a neutral rate that wasnt zero in such a long time what is your typical deposit spread when the neutral rate has a level like and david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp well theres several questions baked into there so if you look at maturities that was the first part of your question we have ph right at billion that will be maturing here in the fourth quarter between our retail customers which is probably billion of that number and then we got some wealth and small business customers regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 were not seeing the flight for yield as much as we had been and so thats dissipating and as i mentioned earlier our cds of to that are maturing new rates for cds are closer to still trying to keep the duration tight i guess the average is probably closer to five months now with this expectation if rates were going to come down we would have an opportunity to take care of it from a money market standpoint you can see a lot of the deposit shift that came out of nib went into money market we can continue to challenge those rates pretty quickly and so and i think we have a mechanism to be able to adjust our rates pretty quickly at fed funds were talking about deposit costs in the range so couple of hundred basis points spread between those two i think indiscernible john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp total deposit cost david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yes yes erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it very helpful that includes not you mean not including noninterestbearing david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yes our total deposit cost erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it john m turner a jr chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp yes including noninterestbearing erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc perfect perfect and john the second question is for you a lot of the remaining challenge so to speak stories in banks have often been management teams and boards undoing underinvestment of predecessors and you guys have always hit the right balance of efficiency and investment as we think about the setup for next year david mentioned the nii trajectory if we remove the election uncertainty i suspect that your fees will benefit as well in should we calibrate our expectation for expenses regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 relative to revenue rather than just resetting it flat to up or whatever it is in other words should the street just expect okay what can regions generate revenuewise in a better environment and just expect positive operating leverage from there david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah i think at the end of the day were committing to positive operating leverage in a lot of what we do is we look at the revenue generation were going to have we have our core expenses were constantly challenging and were trying to figure out how much we can free up for investment because the more we can free up an investment its not just technology and cyber or consumer compliance its people its putting more people on more boots on the ground in the markets that we want to continue grow in but we have obviously a cap in terms of how much we can do based on the revenue generation that we have so we need to generate positive operating leverage we think that creates shareholder value over time and if we can generate more revenue then we can use a bigger piece of the expense base to make those investments but thats where it gets calibrated to come back to generate positive operating leverage john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp i would just add erika were committed to finding ways to eliminate expenses to use those monies to finance investments in our business and if you look at treasury management as an example weve grown relationships by yearoveryear and revenues up yearoveryear in wealth management where weve been adding some wealth bankers and we expect to do that again next year relationships are up and assets under management are up we finally have i think capital markets back on track and that business is continuing to grow its been a great growth story for us since when we began expanding our capabilities there mortgage is an area where were making some investment as we believe that business will improve and then small business we think is an opportunity across our footprint so we believe we have a number of pathways to grow and we intend to finance the investment in that growth through eliminating expenses that will allow us to make those investments erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc perfect thank you john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed with your question john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp morning matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 good morning i was wondering if you guys could talk about the card and atm fee line i know its just a few million dollars down and its not like all that impactful to the overall picture but it was down and i was just looking how its been down six of the past seven quarters yearoveryear and just remind us whats going on there thanks david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah matt thats so you want to pick on the only one that didnt grow okay ph its killing me thats just really a volume thing and a mix between credit and debit and it depends on what season youre in you can get a little bit of noise and all that theres nothing systemic there that shouldnt enable us to grow that over time so theres not a big story there matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and it does seem like the risk of debit card interchange reform has quieted down so is that a line item that youre hopeful of growing in the future david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah i mean the way to grow that is to continue to grow customers and so we focus on growing checking accounts and the more checking accounts we get the more cards we have in peoples hands and i think again being in the markets that were in are going to give us the opportunity to do that especially as we invest in people that i just talked about so yeah i think thats opportunity to grow you do point out that there is a risk there in terms of the debit interchange rules if that goes through it has quieted down we dont know that it theres no law that says it has to change at all from where it is right now so were going to continue to monitor that but right now we dont count that as something thatll happen in john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp yeah and matt id just remind you that when weve talked about this before visa publishes the power score which is a reflection of consumer customers debit utilization activation and utilization and for quarters in a row now regions customer base has been first in terms of power score we have a customer base that very actively uses their cards particularly debit cards and so to davids point as long as we can continue to grow households put more cards in customers hands we believe that theres plenty of opportunity to grow fee revenue associated with that category matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc all right thats helpful thank you very much john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp yeah thank you regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp thank you operator your final question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed with your question betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp morning betsy hey good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey yeah a couple of cleanups here one just we i know we talked a lot about deposit rates and im wondering whats the implication for deposit growth and how are you thinking about that because its the fuel for the balance sheet obviously david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah it gets back to again being in the markets that were in a lot of migration of people and businesses into our markets were making investments in people and our core strategy of our company has been focusing on growth in checking accounts of a consumer in wealth and operating accounts of a business including small business where were really kind of putting more effort on that than we have in the past were up about since the prepandemic in terms of deposits since and so we think we have a good opportunity to grow we have to be competitive with rates betsy i mean were not trying to just be the low cost provider were trying to be fair and balanced and we think weve done that and so were going to have our opportunity to grow and then and on the corporate banking side weve managed about billion of cash off balance sheet for our customers and were not paying the rate that they would want we get it for them and we get a little fee for it but if we ever needed the liquidity for that we could increase our rates and grow there but we havent had to do that what we want to do is make sure were balancing deposit growth and loan growth to maximize our net interest margin betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc sure okay no thats helpful color and appreciate the billion there in the corporate banking the other question i just had is on the investment spend in capital markets specifically is there anything in capital markets that youre thinking about investing more in to power that line and what im thinking about im wondering is the private credit piece of the ecosystem here does continue to grow and there are opportunities for banks to originate help originate source structure et cetera and im wondering is that an area that you would be looking to invest in or you would say absolutely not theres other things that were focused on thanks regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2024 john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp i think were following the developments in the private credit space and there are a couple of different models that are emerging theyre all new and so well follow that with some interest but we dont have any specific inclination at this point much of what were seeing so far in the way of private credit origination in our markets are things that were not interested in doing so higher leverage less covenants just originations that dont interest us at this point but again were following that development closely in terms of capital markets weve made some great investments we want to continue to optimize those seeing the benefits as an example of our investment in small and real estate originations placement revenue separately our ma advisory platforms both clearsight and blackarch are doing well i think we have some opportunity to take advantage of the investments weve made and to look to potentially add some capabilities around the fringes either addons to those businesses or potentially some fixed income sales and trading capabilities over time but we dont have any burning desire to do anything but other than execute well on the investments that weve made so far betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc perfect thank you so much john m turner jr a chairman president chief executive officer regions financial corp yes thank you operator thank you i would like to turn the call back over to john turner for closing comments john m turner jr chairman president chief executive officer regions
