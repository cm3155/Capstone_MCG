our website these disclosures cover our presentation materials prepared comments and qa i will now turn the call over to john john m turner jr president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you dana and good morning everyone we appreciate you joining our call today earlier this morning we reported earnings of million resulting in earnings per share of and while we have some unusual regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 items in our results this quarter our core performance remained strong and we continue to have one of the best return on average tangible common equity ratios in our peer group at during the quarter we continued to experience elevated levels of checkrelated fraud our third quarter results reflected an incremental million in losses stemming from a second fraud scheme which also began in the second quarter but was unknown to us at the time this game manifested itself in delayed returns and as a result has had a much longer tail after adjusting our countermeasures to identify potential fraud instances more quickly the volume of new fraud claims has slowed although difficult to project based on what we know today we expect quarterly fraud losses to come down significantly and to be approximately million in the fourth quarter based upon the increases we are seeing in check fraud across the industry in fact based on data we have we indicated losses were up about year overyear we expect future fraud losses to normalize in the million per quarter range in although the industry faces headwinds from lingering economic and regulatory uncertainty we continue to benefit from our strong and diverse balance sheet with solid capital robust liquidity and prudent credit risk management our proactive hedging strategies have positioned us for success in any interest rate environment and our granular deposit base and relationship banking approach continue to serve us well weve spent over a decade derisking our balance sheet and are wellpositioned to manage through proposed regulatory changes without significant impact to our business model we remain committed to appropriate riskadjusted returns and now is not the time to stretch for growth we are focused on supporting existing customers where we have a relationship and a proven history we have a great team with a proven track record of executing our strategy with focus and discipline im confident in our ability to adapt to the changing regulatory and economic landscape while continuing to generate top quartile returns through the cycle now david will provide some highlights regarding the quarter david jackson turner jr senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thank you john lets start with the balance sheet average and ending loans remained relatively stable quarter overquarter within the business portfolio average loans were stable while ending loans decreased as john mentioned we are being judicious and reserving our capital for business where we can have a full relationship client sentiment varies across industries with some continuing to expect growth while others have a more muted outlook commercial commitments are down compared to the second quarter average and ending consumer loans increased as growth in mortgage and enerbank was partially offset by declines in home equity and runoff exit portfolios subsequent to quarterend we executed the sale of our remaining greensky portfolio of approximately million which represents one of our consumer exit portfolios the economics of the transaction are relatively neutral but will create approximate basis points of incremental chargeoffs in the fourth quarter offset by the related reserve release looking forward we expect ending loan growth to be in the lowsingle digits from a deposit standpoint the modest deposit declines were in line with expectations largely driven by late cycle rateseeking behavior we continue to experience remixing out of noninterest bearing or nib products and ended the quarter with nib representing of total deposits given the current rate environment we expect the regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 percentage to ultimately level off in the low range while some customers find alternatives and other investment channels outside of regions many are moving to our cds and money market accounts we also continue to provide offbalance sheet opportunities through our wealth management platform and in the corporate banking segment via money market mutual fund solutions in the case of corporate clients overall liquidity under management has remained stable quarter over quarteroverquarter acquisition and retention of high primacy and operating relationships are strong reflecting our focus to sustain and extend our deposits advantage through cycles looking forward the higher rate environment the tightening federal reserve and heightened competition will likely continue to constrain deposit growth and pressure costs for the industry through yearend and into early accordingly we expect deposits to be stable to modestly lower in the fourth quarter and we expect continued remixing into interestbearing categories so lets shift to net interest income net interest income declined by in the third quarter reflecting the anticipated normalization from elevated net interest income and margin levels back towards a sustainable longer term range the decline is driven by deposit cost normalization the start of the active period on billion of incremental hedging as well as a onetime leverage lease residual value adjustment as the federal reserve nears the end of its tightening cycle net interest income is supported by elevated floating rate loan and cash yields at higher market interest rates and fixed rate asset turnover from the maturity of lower yielding loans and securities deposit costs continued to increase through a combination of repricing and remixing increasing the cycletodate interestbearing deposit beta to historically this behavior persists for a few quarters after the fed stops moving interest rates while we expect the pace of repricing to moderate a higher federal funds rate over an extended period will cause remixing from lowcost deposits to persist ultimately pushing deposit betas higher than previously anticipated we now project the cycletodate beta to increase to near by yearend regardless we remain confident that our deposit composition will provide a meaningful competitive advantage for regions when compared to the broader industry if the fed remains on hold fourth quarter net interest income is expected to decline approximately driven by continued deposit and funding cost normalization and the beginning of the active hedging period on another billion of previously transacted forward starting swaps net interest income is projected to grow approximately in when compared to as we look to higher rates for longer likely extends the period of deposit cost and mix normalization we expect net interest income trends to stabilize over the first half of the year and grow over the back half of the year the balance sheet hedging program is an important source of earnings stability in todays uncertain environment hedges added to date create a net interest income profile that is wellprotected and mostly neutral to changes in interest rates through while we do not anticipate adding meaningfully to the hedging position over the coming quarters we continue to look for opportunities to add protection at attractive rate levels in outer years through the use of derivatives or securities during the third quarter we added billion of forwardstarting swaps and million of forward starting rate collars so lets take a look at fee revenue and expense adjusted noninterest income decreased from the prior quarter as modest increases in mortgage and wealth management income were offset by declines primarily in service charges and capital markets the increase in mortgage income was driven by higher servicing income associated with the bulk purchase of the rights to service billion of residential mortgage loans closed early in regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 the quarter service charges declined reflecting the run rate impact of the companys overdraft grace feature implemented late in the second quarter based on our experience todate as well as our expectation for another record year in treasury management we now expect fullyear service charges of approximately million total capital markets income decreased million excluding the impact of cva and dva capital markets income decreased sequentially as increases in ma fees were offset by declines in other categories we had a negative million cva and dva adjustment during the quarter versus the million negative adjustment in the prior quarter with respect to the outlook we now expect fullyear adjusted total revenue to be up to compared to lets move on to noninterest expense adjusted noninterest expense decreased compared to the prior quarter and includes the previously noted elevated operational losses excluding the incremental fraud experienced in both the second and third quarters adjusted noninterest expenses increased sequentially salaries and benefits decreased driven primarily by lower incentives and payroll taxes while other non interest expense increased driven primarily by a million pension settlement charge we remain committed to prudently managing expenses in order to fund investments in our business we will continue to refine our expense base focusing on our largest categories which includes salaries and benefits occupancy and vendor spend we expect full year adjusted noninterest expenses to be up excluding the million of incremental operational losses experienced in the past two quarters we expect adjusted noninterest expenses to be up approximately in when compared to from an asset quality standpoint overall credit performance continues to normalize as expected net chargeoffs increased basis points to basis points due to elevated chargeoffs related to a solar program weve since discontinued at enerbank as well as lower commercial recoveries versus the second quarter nonperforming loans business services criticized loans and total delinquencies also increased nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans increased basis points in the quarter due primarily to a large collateralized information credit provision expense was million or million in excess of net chargeoffs the allowance for credit loss ratio increased basis points to while the allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans declined to the increase to our allowance is due primarily to adverse risk migration and continued credit quality normalization as well as a build in qualitative adjustments for incremental risk in certain portfolios including office multifamily in select markets and enerbank its also worth noting the outcome of the most recent shared national credit exam is reflected in our results the allowance on the office portfolio increased from to importantly the vast majority of our office exposure is in class a properties located primarily within the sunbelt and nongateway markets overall we continue to feel good about the composition of our office book and do not expect any meaningful loss in this portfolio we expect net chargeoffs will continue to normalize including this quarters chargeoffs but excluding the 14basispoint impact on our fourth quarter greensky loan sale we expect fullyear adjusted net chargeoff ratio to be slightly above basis points in the third quarter two anticipated notices of proposed rulemaking were issued while we plan to provide feedback through the comment process on both were wellpositioned to absorb the ultimate impacts without major changes to our business regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 with respect to basel iii endgame as proposed we estimate a low to midsingle digit increase in riskweighted assets under the expanded riskbased approach in addition to the phasein of aoci into regulatory capital regarding minimum longterm debt we estimate a need to issue approximately billion of longterm debt over the course of several years we view this amount to be manageable resulting in a modest drag on earnings importantly the proposal provide clarity on the evolution of the regulatory environment and support our decision to maintain our common equity tier ratio around over the near term as this level should provide sufficient flexibility to meet the proposed changes along the implementation timeline while supporting strategic growth objectives despite the current macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty as well as the continued evolution of the regulatory framework we expect that share repurchases will resume in the near term and finally we have a slide summarizing our expectations which we have addressed throughout the prepared comments with that well move to the qa portion of the call question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you our first question comes from line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thank you for taking the question i wanted to start out just on the nii trajectory when we talk about nii stabilizing in the first half of i guess we might be suggesting that it could continue to compress a bit after the fourth quarters dip so maybe just thinking if you could help us to sort of size the any potential pressure beyond yearend and then additionally your thoughts on what would allow it to resume growing in the second half of next year david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah hey scott this is david so youre right you will see some pressure in the fourth quarter in particular as we see a continued remixing of noninterestbearing deposits going into interestbearing given higher for longer rates and due to the fact that we have billion of notional interest rate swaps that become live in the fourth quarter through that so that alone cost about million in the in nii so youll see an adjustment not as big as you just saw relative to net interest margin decline but youll see some decline in the fourth quarter when we get to the third quarter while we do have an additional billion of interest rate swaps that become live then we think the remixing will start slowing we think there is somewhere between billion and billion worth of remixing of noninterestbearing deposits into interestbearing and thats going back in studying our consumers in particular and how much they had in their accounts relative to their spend and where that billion to billion gets you back to where they were from a prepandemic standpoint so we have confidence that we should see this starting to slow after the fourth quarter there will be like i said a little pressure in the first quarter because of the new derivatives coming on that number will affect us about million to million in the first quarter then we dont have any more after that so we start stabilizing from there and when we get to the second half of the year we can start to grow if i kind of cut to the chase on the endgame we think after all is said and done we can support our margin should bottom out around perhaps a bit higher than that so youre not going to see the kind you cant take the regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 change that you just saw and continue to extrapolate that all the way through the end of the second quarter it youll have a bigger change in the fourth a smaller change in the first and negligible change in the second quarter so the balance sheet whats important in all that is the balance sheet continues to reprice we have about billion worth of fixed rate securities and loans that reprice and the front book back book impacts are about basis points and we continue to have have had that the problem is its been overwhelmed by the move of non interestbearing deposits into interestbearing and as i just mentioned that should start to slow and so i think again our margin bottoming out kind of in that or slightly better than that is really the relevant point here r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you for that color and then i guess just on the notion of deposits and betas i know were thinking about a beta through the end of the year but maybe thoughts on how things could trend into next year if we indeed have just sort of some drag on pricing how much more pressure could we see once rates peaked and how indiscernible might that level off david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah i think so whats baked into what i just told you is that we would have a beta through the end of this year push it on maybe a little underneath that and then we go into perhaps the mid into next year and again thats just considering higher for longer it starts to slow there again because we dont have as much moving out of noninterestbearing into interestbearing so i think the again if we have rates even continue to go up were slightly assetsensitive and the repricing of our balance sheet starts to overwhelm the deposit moves and i think thats the thats a piece that people might not be picking up on r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right wonderful thank you very much david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp you bet operator our next question comes from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs please proceed with your question david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thank you ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc maybe to ask a question on credit first maybe just to clarify the implied a little bit above for the year which i guess implies around for the fourth quarter so that pushes reported up to about with greensky i just wanted to verify that and then can you expand on the comments regarding what youre seeing in office multifamily and maybe what happened with enerbank which i think you referenced higher chargeoffs and exiting some parts of the portfolio david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so you want me to start john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp so yeah i think that well see some increase so lets take the greensky piece out because thats going to be noise and we kind of announced that separate go back to kind of core chargeoffs we said will be slightly higher than call that a couple of points maybe which implies a fourth quarter in that 40basis point chargeoff range we will continue to see elevated chargeoffs coming through enerbank for which we provided this past quarter relative to our program that we discontinued and so well see that for a quarter or two and thats factored into the guidance that weve given you from an office standpoint our office continues to decline even in october i think we put that in john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp outstanding continues to decline the quality of the portfolio david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp im speaking sorry john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp maybe ill speak to that regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp okay john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp with respect to office weve got about billion in outstanding to davids point that represents some decline paydowns refinances over the course of the last quarter as we said before about of that portfolio is in credits direct to single tenant credits and the bulk of that is to investmentgrade quality tenants the balance of our exposure 61plus percent are in multitenant credits of that is in the sunbelt market is class a we have in total about borrowers so we are very much on top of the portfolio having ongoing conversations with customers about of our exposure matures this year and in so were actively working that one of the i think good signs about the portfolio is that sponsors have contributed over the course of the last couple of quarters over million to the projects most of them are unguaranteed so those are commitments the sponsors are making to the continued renewal and extension of those projects the rightsizing of them and as a consequence we feel good about our office exposure we have one nonaccrual and that credit has been renegotiated and is paying as agreed currently david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp got it and john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp and david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah im sorry john sorry john go ahead john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah the rest of the portfolio we did see some uptick in nonaccruals as david said were still guiding to to basis points of loss in we feel good about that i think the portfolio is performing as we expected as it normalizes and thats occurring within enerbank we have a specific program that was associated with a single vendor and it effectively was what i would call kind of a buy now pay later program where the customer entered into an agreement to put solar equipment on their house there was a period of time when that equipment would be installed on the house the customer did not make any payments we exited that program in october of just based on our analysis of the riskadjusted returns associated with it and the profile of the products it was just not something we wanted to continue well now were beginning to see those loans reach a point where customers are having to make payments and we are experiencing a little higher level of losses but the losses within enerbank are still below our expectations regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 for enerbank in general and it continues to perform better than at least consistent with if not better than we had hoped when we made the acquisition ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it david maybe a followup on expenses i know theres lots of moving pieces in this scenario i know youve highlighted that you guys have been doing work on for a while but just given the revenue headwinds that youre likely to face in the beginning of the of the year can you maybe just talk about what youre doing and while i know you might not be ready to give guidance do you think you could potentially hold the line on expenses and keep them relatively flat given the challenging revenue environment into thanks david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so i dont think it should be a surprise to anybody that revenue is going to be challenging thats been out there for a while weve known it and as a result we started working on our expense management and our continuous improvement program throughout this particular quarter unfortunately we had some things that the fraud pension settlement we had some equipment software costs that wont repeat at the level that we had and some professional fees that we incurred that we dont think that will be repeated that being said were going to need to even double down on expense management for were not going to give you a guidance for that but i think suffice it to say our reported number that we have for we should be able to have our number in to be underneath our reported number for how much well give you guidance as we get towards end of the year but yeah i think we should be able to be underneath that number john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp and id just add ryan that weve demonstrated i think over time a commitment to effectively manage expenses and its our intention to continue doing that we realize the importance of it ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc appreciate all the color david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore please proceed with your question david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp hey john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 good morning on the fraud cost if you could give us a little bit more color on that were they running higher than expected than you had expected when you discussed them last quarter and why have they been persistent given the issue that you discovered and also that million per quarter of fraud cost that you flagged for is that brand new or was that already to a degree baked into your run rate expectation as you look at or is this brand new given the longerthanexpected persistence of this issue david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so let me answer the second question first so the million per quarter is slightly higher than our historical run rate fraud is increasing dramatically in the industry we seem to be the one to call it out its hit us very hard to your first question this was a different scheme this time than what we reported on last quarter and unfortunately this scheme that they had you dont know about until the banks on which the checks are written notify you that thats not a good item and it takes about to days before you know that we can look at when events occurred and we can kind of see a pattern where we feel reasonably confident that were not going to see that kind of increase going forward from the schemes that weve seen and of course we are putting in new controls were putting in new technology and its very disappointing we have the million john a bit higher call it million higher than we historically have had because this is just a big deal in the industry and so we want to be a bit conservative well give you better guidance on expenses including fraud when we get to reporting on expectations later so its a tad higher but john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay all right david thank you and then i guess related to that i mean given this is the second visible fraud issue to come up in as many quarters are you getting any pressure incrementally from regulators to invest more actively like you said around these new controls that youre putting in or any input there and then separately on the capital front you talked about buybacks likely to resume in the near term can you maybe give us some color on the timing and potential magnitude there david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp sure so we wont talk about our relationships with our regulators but fraud is our issue if we have to have our regulators tell us what to do with regards to fraud or anything else we probably already missed that boat so thats not an issue and were highly disappointed in it were working hard we have found some people that have committed fraud theyve been put in jail but again the industry report we saw is up from billion in to billion of fraud in thus far in sorry so its affecting all of us but it seems to have gotten us at a kind of concentrated in these two quarters and again i feel confident we put in controls and well be putting in more monitoring it going forward relative to capital yeah so were at on common equity tier we now have seen the basel iii endgame proposal well be going through and providing our comment letter on that as well as to that npr we feel confident in kind of where we are relative to that and the implementation timeframe hopefully we get a bit of a reprieve on that but even if we didnt we feel that were in a good place to be able to implement that without too much harm and theres no need for us to continue to let our capital to continue to increase we accrete to basis points of capital every quarter so if we did nothing we would be pushing on thats just higher than we need and so we think we can enter into buybacks as soon as we get out of the blackout period and what we left in our comments was we would operate close or around that cet1 number regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 john pancari q analyst evercore group llc great thanks david appreciate it operator our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your question david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp hey ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning i guess thanks for the color on cre office just was wondering if you can talk about anything beyond cre office particularly on multifamily in any of the sunbelt states weve read articles about oversupply in some of these markets like raleigh austin etcetera just talk to us one in terms of exposure and if whether or not youre seeing softness within multifamily john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp so ebrahim this is john turner we our total exposure i think in multifamily just exceeds just above billion it is a very diverse portfolio spread across total submarkets some number like that we are in terms of concentrations our top five exposures would be in cities that you would recognize dallas houston charlotte raleigh orlando miami places where we have just historically banked and have a presence we dont have any concentrations at all in any of those markets that would exceed i think one exception would exceed so again good diversity we are seeing some softening of rents increasing costs associated with interest cost about a little over of the portfolio is currently still under construction so we expect that those construction projects to be completed over the next months to deliver out were not while were watching it closely we really havent seen any adverse movement within the portfolio to speak of and again given the location of our projects which are in suburban markets given the diversity of the distribution across geographies and the location primarily in the sunbelt we feel good about our multifamily portfolio ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks john and just a separate question in terms of the deposit beta outlook that you mentioned how are indiscernible in term of the mix of customers one are you seeing indiscernible because of usage and thats driving indiscernible talk about that to some extent and then where do you cds shaking out in terms of demand from borrowers from deposit customers and where cd mix could be months from now if we dont get any rate cuts thanks david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 yeah you were breaking up there a little bit but i think you were saying what are we seeing in terms of movement of nib into cds so thats been the big change thus far for us i think our cds are right at just under of our book of our total deposit book that could grow we do have money market offers that were working on we want to be competitive this remix has been really relegated to highnet worth customers that are taking excess cash and putting it to work and the reason we think that that remix is somewhere in the to to go is because that customer base gets down to having the amount of cash in their account relative to the spend pattern that they had prepandemic and so i think that happens by the end of next year i mean the middle of next year as we think about where cd balances could be as a percentage of total deposits maybe you pick up another 2or through that remix and it really is dependent on how we think about other offers money market and were working on that so there could be some mix in terms of how that to gets put to work but specific to cds to ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator our next question comes from line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your question david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp hi ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey david and hi john just a quick question on the fee side very clear guidance for the fourth quarter just those service charges continue to come in much better million for the year obviously an implied lower exit for the fourth quarter can any line of sight in terms of like are we getting close to the leveling out periods here on that service charges line in terms of yeah i know cash management has been outgrowing the other pieces but is this kind of the right level to use going forward david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah i think from a fee standpoint lets break down the two big pieces so our service charge number relative to our 24hour grace that was implemented in the middle of the second quarter so we have a full quarter run rate on that we dont see that changing materially weve been very proud of our treasury management team thats done a good job of penetrating our commercial base and were seeing that hold up pretty well so i dont think you should see the kind of decline in service charges that you just saw and the only thing that can affect us in fees would be theres a discussion going on with debit interchange and theres been percentages thrown out as to what that may mean just to level set with everybody we have about million of debit per year so whatever percentage change we have you can do your own math on that were not sure that that will even come out but thats been mentioned and so we thought i thought id just put that out there regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah thats fair and david can we just come back on the capital point youre comfortably in that 10plus zone and theres obviously not a lot of current growth in the loan book so just the push and pull of potentially re engaging in the buyback versus just keeping where you are and are left at a more uncertain environment kind of just walk us through just what will be your thought process there david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp sure so as you know we do an awful lot of stress testing we do it constantly we have our ccar submission we have a midyear submission we feel very confident that even if we go into a recession which we are not calling for but even if we did wed have capital to withstand that so its all about optimization ken and we think that our we still believe our operating range of million to million is the right range for regions based on our risk profile that being said weve had an npr we have uncertainty going on so we added basis points to give us the flexibility to adapt and overcome whatever environment is thrown at us we dont see the need to take and let it ride up to and keep going and so were thats what gives us confidence we dont have a big cre book like others do we dont have the risk that some others do and we have a very good engine our ppr engine is among the strongest because of our deposit profile that we have and so we have confidence that our earnings stream is going to get us where we need to be and we think that we have enough capital right now so if we generate more we can buy our stock back ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it okay thanks david operator our next question comes from line of erika najarian with ubs please proceed with your question david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning david my first question is for you i feel like given the reaction of the stock i think its probably best if we completely derisk consensus numbers right so forgive me for asking a super specific question but based on the disclosure of the swap book and everything that youre telling us about deposit behavior and higher for longer it seems like you could hit that sort of trough in the first quarter kind of stay there maybe go up a little bit and then get towards if not a little bit over by so that gives you sort of a full year of lets call it between before again based on the forward curve based on slow growth does that feel fair david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp i think youre pretty good at math i dont know if thats youve nailed exactly regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp were not giving any guidance david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp were not giving any guidance youve done pretty well youre understanding exactly how this works in terms of a bigger downdraft in the fourth quarter than youll see in the first part of the year and then be able to grow from there so directionally youre exactly right erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and then ill follow up with david indiscernible the balance sheet later because i do want to ask this second question to john i think i guess what was surprising to me is that you had like a bnpl solar thing to begin with right so regions has done a great job at not only convincing investors that its completely changed in terms of its underwriting and risk management but also that in the numbers and i guess this is a twopart question number one as you think about an uncertain indiscernible ahead do you feel like youve sort of fully captured like things like that the bnl solar that youre now discontinuing that may not be something that you would normally do under your risk management profile and maybe the followup question to that is the basis points i think a lot of investors are thinking about a mild recession in maybe it just feels like for bank investors versus other types of investors but in that case where would regions peak indiscernible recession relative to that basis point range for next year john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp i think that the answer to your first question is yes to anything that were and we feel like weve been through our portfolios certainly been through the new businesses weve acquired and any products or programs that dont meet our risk and return profiles weve exited and in the case of this particular program as i mentioned we exited it in because of the structure of it weve only begun to see some results and frankly those results probably are consistent with our expectations when we shut the program down so we are continuing to always evaluating the performance of our products of our capabilities our businesses our portfolios to ensure that were getting an appropriate return on the business that we do and so im pretty comfortable there with respect to our guidance of to basis points in the period of to our average chargeoffs were basis points and so i think we still and we have contemplated we believe what we consider to be the probability of a soft landing versus a mild recession in our projections for chargeoffs and at this point still feel good about the to basis points in david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp and i would add is its david that if you think about our recessions probably if it comes it would be we think fairly mild as we look at consumers and we can look at them through the checking account and activity going in there we look at businesses we talk to our business partners all the time businesses and consumers are in regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 pretty good shape and in particular for the consumer if you look at housing prices those continue to remain strong and a lot of our lending if you will in the consumer space is tied to the house to the home so i think that we have a bit of a buffer and going back to the history that john just mentioned the basis points between and gives us confidence that even if we did that wed be in that range john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you operator our next question comes from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please proceed with your question john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning and thanks for taking my question you noted that higher rates are pushing up deposit betas and also changing the mix in nib and ib deposits some of your peers have been saying were closer to the end of this do you think that theres anything different that youre seeing versus peers or is your deposit strategy changing in any way given the increased likelihood of higher for longer rates david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp i dont think our deposit base if anything is a bit better than the peer group we dont have anything unique to us that would cause our beta to be higher than anybody else in this rising rate environment as a matter of fact we did happen to grow more noninterestbearing deposits during the pandemic than most of our peers and thats being put to work so that element of it maybe that piece of it is a bit different and thats what we called for in the guidance that weve given you that it would remix into interestbearing accounts we still have a low loandeposit ratio we still have not wholesale funded so i dont think that whatever the beta is in the industry regions is going to be better than that were already better than that right now with a beta of and the peers are at on a peer median basis right now so i just dont think that if its coming to the end and then itll come to the end for us too manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 got it and then just a separate question on liquidity several of your peers have increased their levels of cash this quarter how do you think about managing your liquidity ahead of any changes in the lcr rules david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so we still have again a very liquid balance sheet access to do that we maintain a good cash position right now we havent added to our securities book as much as some others we think to the extent the lcr comes in well be able to be compliant with that without any major changes to our structure of our balance sheet manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator our final question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please proceed with your question john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey john hi david david can we circle back to the shared national credit exam im curious obviously its changed over the years and if i recall it correctly they examine those books both in the spring and the fall which you referenced and well get the results early in february or sometime in february but can you share with us any color like what was the emphasis was it on leveraged loans was it on office commercial or real estate was there greater stress in certain markets over others just any elaboration would be helpful john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah gerard this is john we didnt notice anything specific about the most recent exam it was broadbased both with respect to product type and business and geography gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then you guys touched a little bit about the economy in your markets so you gave us obviously the forecast you use in building out cecl reserves what are you guys seeing down there theres so many crosscurrents going on in the national numbers is it still im assuming theres strength theres employment strength theres business strength any color there would be helpful as well john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah across the southeast which is where of our deposits are in seven southeastern states if we add texas it goes above were still seeing a pretty strong economy and in seven of the eight southeastern states that we would point to unemployment rates are at or near historical lows customers are still consumers are still in a very good position there are plenty of work there are routinely economic development projects regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 new jobs being announced across markets alabama tennessee georgia florida mississippi and of course texas is continuing to do really well so id say customer sentiment is still positive but cautious given all the things that are going on both the national and international geopolitical level but customers are businesses are just still doing pretty well and the consumer definitely is gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc actually john just a followup quickly there putting the geopolitical international issues on the side for a moment do you have any sense what the customers are looking for to give them more confidence is it the fed finishing with interest rates raising interest rates until we get to that terminal rate or is it better the better budgeting out of washington what because we hear this from your peers as well so its not uncommon but what im trying to figure out what the catalysts will be where businesses really get confident again john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp i think the biggest thing is the federal reserve and the fed making a declaration that inflation is now under control and that theyre not going to continue to raise rates they dont have to continue to raise rates i think theyve been sitting in that message and creating a sense that the environment is more stable than others might business owners might feel today would be hugely helpful with respect to whats going on in the national level politically i dont know that i have an answer for you there and i dont expect that to change anytime in the near term gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great no i appreciate it thank you john m turner jr president chief executive officer director regions financial corp okay thats all the callers for today appreciate your participating thank you ill just say it has been an unusual quarter we had a number of things going on but at the core our business is really sound and solid we have spent the last years working to build a balance sheet and income statement thats going to be consistently performing sustainable and resilient and we believe weve done that we have a lot of confidence in our future performance and appreciate your support thank you operator
