our website these disclosures cover our presentation materials prepared comments and qa ill now turn the call over to john john m turner jr president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you dana and good morning everyone we appreciate you joining our call today were very pleased with our first quarter results early this morning we reported earnings of million resulting in earnings per share of despite the challenging geopolitical backdrop and elevated inflation we remain optimistic about we have a strong balance sheet positioned to withstand an array of economic conditions business customers for the most part have adapted and are prospering in the new operating environment new loan commitments and pipelines remain strong and utilization rates continue to increase the consumer remains healthy net population migration inflows in our markets remain robust and the majority of our footprint has returned to equal or better than prepandemic employment levels asset quality remains strong with virtually all credit related metrics improving in the quarter and net chargeoffs remain below historical levels the integration of sabal enerbank and clearsight are progressing as planned and were excited about their growing contributions additionally we continue to make investments in talent and technology to support strategic growth initiatives we kicked off with a strong start and expect to continue building on that momentum we have a solid strategic plan an outstanding team and a proven track record of successful execution now dave will provide you with some select highlights regarding the quarter david jackson turner jr senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thank you john lets start with the balance sheet average loans grew while ending loans grew during the quarter average business loans increased reflecting broadbased growth in corporate middle market and real estate lending across our diversified and specialized portfolios regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 while still below prepandemic levels commercial loan line utilization levels ended the quarter at approximately increasing basis points over the prior quarter loan production also remained strong late quarter commitments up approximately billion average consumer loans declined as increases in mortgage and other consumer were offset by declines in other categories within other consumer enerbank loans grew approximately compared to the fourth quarter looking forward we expect fullyear average loan balances to grow to compared to and excluding ppp loans and consumer exit portfolios we expect fullyear average loan balances to grow to so lets turn to deposits although the pace of deposit growth has slowed balances continue to increase seasonally this quarter to new record levels average consumer and wealth management deposits increased compared to the fourth quarter but corporate deposits remain relatively stable we are continuing to analyze our deposit base and pandemicrelated deposit increases approximately of the increase or billion is expected to be more stable with behavior similar to our core consumer deposit book this segment is historically quite granular and generally rate insensitive and therefore can be relied upon to support longer term asset growth through the rate cycle the remaining of the deposit increases is a mixture of commercial and other customer types that are expected to be more rate sensitive or that we are less certain about their longterm behavior we assume this segment may have allin beta of roughly this elevated beta assumption includes relationship repricing and some balances shifting from noninterest to interestbearing categories it also reflects a range of billion to billion of balance reduction attributable to tightening monetary policy the combination of these segments and our legacy deposit base represents significant upside for us as rates increase so lets shift to net interest income and margin net interest income was stable quarteroverquarter excluding reduced contributions from ppp net interest income grew benefiting from solid loan growth and rising interest rates net interest income from ppp loans decreased million from the prior quarter and will be less of a contributor going forward approximately of estimated ppp fees have been recognized cash averaged billion during the quarter and when combined with ppp reduced first quarters reported margin by basis points our adjusted margin was higher by basis points versus the fourth quarter the path where net interest income enters the second quarter was strong momentum from both balance sheet growth and higher interest rates excluding ppp average loan balances grew in the first quarter and a similar amount of growth is expected next quarter roughly billion of securities were also added late in the quarter further benefiting future periods the recent runup in rates has certainly validated our decision to wait to deploy into securities and while not included in our current outlook additional securities would provide incremental benefit higher short and long term interest rates provided additional lift to net interest income in the first quarter and these benefits are expected to expand in the coming quarters total net interest income is projected to increase regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 to in the second quarter and is expected to accelerate throughout the year such that the fourth quarter net interest income is expected to be approximately higher than our first quarter regions balance sheet is positioned to benefit meaningfully from higher interest rates over the first basis points of rate tightening each basis point increase in the federal funds rate is projected to add between million and million over a full month period this benefit is supported by a large proportion of stable deposit funding and a significant amount of earning assets held in cash which compares favorably to the industry overall over a longer horizon a more normal interest rate environment or roughly a fed funds rate will support our net interest margin goal of approximately while we have purposefully retained leverage to higher interest rates during a period of lower rates we will attempt to manage a more normal interest rate risk profile as interest rate environment normalizes the feds aggressive path for interest rates gives us the opportunity to protect nii at attractive levels we have begun this process by adding billion yeartodate of forward starting receive fixed swaps and a billion of spot starting securities this represents approximately of the total hedging amount needed this cycle now lets take a look at fee revenue and expense adjusted noninterest income decreased from the prior quarter primarily due to reduced hr asset valuations as well as lower capital markets and card and atm fees within capital markets ma advisory activity was muted by seasonality as well as the timing of transactions pipelines remain robust but some deals have been pushed to later in the year additionally debt and the real estate capital markets were impacted by uncertainty surrounding rates geopolitical tensions and volatility in credit spreads however we are seeing some stabilization in the loan and fixed income markets and anticipate conditions will improve in coming quarters further the reduction in real estate capital markets activity was offset by the addition of sabal capital partners for the full quarter similar to the corporate fixed income market refinance demand has been softer than expected in our agency multifamily finance business as investors assess a significant move in interest rates we continue to expect capital markets to generate quarterly revenue of million to million excluding the impact of cva and dva while we expect to be near the lower end of the range next quarter we expect the activity to pick up in the second half of the year card and atm fees reflect seasonally lower interchange on both debit and credit cards in addition debit card fees were further impacted by fewer days in the quarter mortgage income remained relatively stable and included approximately million in gains associated with previously repurchased ginnie mae loans sold during the quarter while mortgage is anticipated to decline relative to it is still expected to remain a key contributor to fee revenue wealth management income also remained stable this quarter despite elevated market volatility service charges were also stable during the quarter despite seasonal declines in nsf and overdraft related fees the first phase of previously announced nsf and overdraft policy changes were effective at the end of the first quarter and the remaining changes will be implemented over the second and third quarters these changes when combined with the previously implemented changes are expected to result in full year service charges of approximately million and full year service charges of approximately million regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 we expect adjusted total revenue to be up to compared to the prior year driven primarily by growth in net interest income this growth includes the impact of lower ppprelated revenue and the anticipated impact of nsf and overdraft changes so lets move on to noninterest expense adjusted noninterest expenses decreased in the quarter driven by lower salaries and benefits expense and professional and legal fees salaries and benefits decreased primarily due to lower incentive compensation despite higher payroll taxes and 401k expense salaries and benefits also include the favorable impact of lower hr asset valuations professional and legal fees decreased significantly as elevated fees associated with our bolton ma activity in the fourth quarter did not repeat we will continue to prudently manage expenses while investing in technology products and people to grow our business as a result our core expense base will grow we expect adjusted noninterest expenses to be up to compared to importantly this includes the fullyear impact of recent acquisitions as well as anticipated inflationary impacts we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage in overall credit performance remains strong annualized net chargeoffs increased basis point to basis points nonperforming loans continued to improve during the quarter and remain below prepandemic levels at just basis points of total loans our allowance for credit losses decreased basis points to of total loans while the allowance as a percentage of nonperforming loans increased percentage points to the decline in the allowance reflects ongoing improvement in asset quality and continued resolution of pandemic issues partially offset by loan growth and general economic volatility associated primarily with inflation and geopolitical unrest the allowance reduction resulted in a net million benefit to the provision we expect credit losses to slowly begin to normalize in the back half of and currently expect full year net chargeoffs to be in the basis points to basis point range with respect to capital we ended the quarter with a common equity tier i ratio modestly lower at an estimated and we expect to maintain it near the midpoint of our to operating range so wrapping up on the next slide our updated expectations which weve already addressed i do want to point out that these expectations do not include any additional security purchases so that certainly provides the opportunity for incremental benefit in closing as john mentioned we began with great momentum and despite geopolitical tensions and market uncertainty we remain well positioned for growth as the economic recovery continues pretax preprovision income remains strong expenses are wellcontrolled credit risk is relatively benign capital and liquidity are solid and we are optimistic about the pace of the economic recovery in our markets with that were happy to take your questions regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs please proceed with your question ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning john good morning david david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp good morning ryan john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc i was hoping maybe you could talk about expectations for deposit growth which came in better than expected and particularly as it pertains to the surge deposit so maybe just how youre thinking about the tradeoff between keeping some of these deposits and the potential for a higher beta and i think david you highlighted a potential for a billion to billion reduction can you maybe just clarify how much you expect for these to stick around and what it means for deposit growth david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp sure so we had expected the billion to billion of deposits to start flowing out in the first quarter we have maintained pretty conservative deposit assumptions but if you look at the growth and where it came from it was in our consumer book we continue to grow accounts and continue to have a high level of primacy with our retail customers and so our deposit base is our competitive advantage and it has been that way for a long time and were looking to leverage that as we get into this higher rate environment as you think about the surge deposits we have a third of those that we think are going to be fairly similar to our legacy deposits in terms of beta price insensitive then we have the other third on the other end we think are much higher beta to beta those are corporate deposits that are you could characterize those as nonoperational deposits that are probably going to look for a better home or a higher rate as time goes by well see what happens after this next rate increase but weve expected that to either reprice or really flow out of the bank regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 and then you have in the middle which is another third deposits that are stimulus receiving deposits small business type deposits that ones a little harder to predict we do have a higher beta on it not as high as the as the second group but any event if were wrong on the billion to billion its likely that weve maintained our deposits at a higher level and over time if we see that then that gives us a little more comfort to be able to take some of our excess cash that we have some billion sitting on the balance sheet to deploy that into the securities book but our guidance that were giving you does not have that deployed intentionally ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and if we could dig a little bit into the new hedging program so david i dont know if derons in the room i guess you guys were the masters of adding swaps in a timely manner last cycle and now youve begun this new program so i think the market is having a little bit of trouble understanding why banks are adding swaps at this part of the cycle and i think all of us understand so can you maybe just talk about thoughts regarding locking in here particularly using forward starters and i think you talked about another to of additions can you maybe just talk about pacing and why this is the right decision at this point in the cycle for regions thanks david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp ill go ahead and start and if deron is here i think he can add to it but you hit on a key word and that is forward starting and so what were trying to do is get our margin to the optimum level and then layer in protection for that margin over time so if you look at where we put the first call it billion in thats at a receive fixed rate of those are largely going to be effective for so we intentionally had them forward starting because we believe there is risk at that point in the cycle that actually rates could go the other way and we want to be able to protect that if wrong and it happens to not reverse and go lower then we havent lost anything we havent given up any of our net interest income or margin at that point these are all fiveyear duration just like they were last cycle and so when you do it forward starting you can take advantage of pricing theyre not all that expensive to get into and were not giving up our asset sensitivity today thats important we are becoming and maintain our sensitivity and if you on the comments just a minute ago the way were structured in the balance sheet is to benefit in particular at the back end such that our nii in the fourth quarter should be up from the first quarter and its just the nature of how our sensitivity is structured at this point in time deron anything you want to add to that m deron smithy a executive vice president treasurer regions financial corp the only thing i would add is david said it well page of the deck just really shows the path of the net interest margin which really underscores what david is saying were going to enjoy nice margin expansion as the fed is tightening policy but we have a very disciplined approach to manage that exposure as rates push higher regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 as david said the probability of a downturn at some point if the fed has to push higher increases over time and so we want to be cognizant of that and as we get delivered those higher rates put in that protection and really manage the downside risk in those out years ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thank you both for all the color david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thank you operator your next question will come from the line of christopher spahr with wells fargo please proceed with your question christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc good morning john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc so other banks seem to be spending their rate driven incremental net interest income or at least some of it whereas you kept your cost guidance unchanged so why do you think that is and with this higher nii outlook how confident are you that you can expand on your positive operating leverage this year next year david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well im kind of leveraging the comments just before the way we structured the balance sheet our nii itll be growing nicely and throughout the year but are really strong in the fourth quarter which sets up a really strong were still asset sensitive through that time period and so we should have a nice tailwind in terms of revenue growth we pride ourselves on being able to control our cost we did a good job this quarter there is that hr valuation asset that benefited us by million so you need to add that back to kind of get us level set but in any event we continue to leverage our continuous improvement program to stay focused on how we get better every day and how we can leverage technology and process improvement so that we can keep our costs down because we are taking our savings and reinvesting those savings in things like digital talent continuing to hire people so that we can grow we had mentioned that the vast majority of our growth and expenses this year are related to the three acquisitions that we closed in the fourth quarter of so weve had a little bit of inflation weve had to deal with and so were continuing to work at all levels to try and keep our costs under control and generate positive regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 operating leverage which we believe we will have in we didnt have it this quarter but we will when you get to when you look at the whole year and expect to have that going forward in christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you operator your next question will come from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please proceed with your question gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning john good morning david john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp hey good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc david in the slide deck slide you give us the difference in the net interest margins based upon whats weighing down your margin today with the ppp loans and the excess cash can you share with us on the excess cash portion where do where does the fed funds rate need to go where youre not going to need to have that bullet point anymore because it will match your reported margin david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well it really gets back to the deposit expectations so weve maintained this excess cash to be prepared to the extent the surge deposits do seek other alternatives and we have to pay that out obviously were getting beta on the cash while we wait but being patient has benefited us putting that into the securities book earlier would really cost us and we did put a little bit of that to work this quarter billion of that at about a carry if we were to do it today it be even higher and so in the range so i think its important for us to understand what the surge deposit flows are going to do relative to what the fed rate movements are going to be and i think over a fairly short period of time our cash will get down to our normalized level which is billion to billion and then we wont have to have this disclosure and of course ppp will runoff for the most part after this year we wont have to talk about that one either gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup especially talking to you with your background as an accountant can you share with us your thoughts about aoci we all understand its an accounting issue and its only for the securities portfolio obviously similar to your peers had a big negative number this quarter which took down tangible book value per share and book value per share again similar to your peers so youre not standing out regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 but at what point does it become an issue for banks and again i know it doesnt go through your cet1 ratio like it does for the advanced approach banks but do we have to ever get concerned about it if it keeps on the aoic keeps on getting larger on the negative side david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp so ill try to answer this without getting upset i think the account gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc wait david i didnt ask it on cecl i thought that david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well that ones so you hit on two of their four core accounting standards relative to what were doing but in any event we have to follow gaap so oci does not the change in oci relative to securities gains doesnt affect our thinking whatsoever we manage the company based on regulatory cap or capital based on the regulatory rules and for category iv banks like regions and most of our peers thats excluded from the regulatory calculation importantly its also excluded from the rating agencies so they carve out the change in oci relative to securities not importantly its also excluded from the rating agency so they carve out the change in oci relative to securities not pension or other things but securities they carve out and whats frustrating about it is that nobody talks about measuring the fair value of our deposit base which is where the cash came from to go buy the securities and so were marking one element of a balance sheet through capital and thats just not how we manage the company and so its really irrelevant its done because its easy to do we can go get a quote but the fair value of the deposits in particular for regions because of the primacy because of the granularity the fair value of our deposits are shooting through the roof you just dont see that manifest itself on the balance sheet you will see it manifests itself in growing nii and net interest margin this is the time period weve been waiting for for rates to rise so the fact that oci is working against tangible book value we could care less gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good appreciate the insights david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp could not care less i should operator your next question will come from the line of erika najarian with ubs please proceed with your question regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc my first question is a followup to ryans questioning the way you wrote out slide it seems like your that your nii guide includes both a billion to billion potential indiscernible of deposits and beta i guess im asking if im reading that correctly should it be one or the other in other words if they stick around it might have a beta david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc does that make sense david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah yeah dont duplicate that the billion to billion is baked into the billion so if were wrong our beta will be lower thus far as i mentioned on ryans question we thought deposits these particular billion to billion of the deposit would start flowing out in the first quarter they did not we still think thats going to happen perhaps its just delayed a little bit waiting for the next move which we believe is going to be basis points by the way in may and we think those with our largely corporate nonoperational deposits are going to seek a higher return than were willing to pay and theyre probably going to move off the balance sheet in that case so this really doesnt this is not going to be a big deal to us weve been planning for it all along erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and as we think about your nii guide david what type of earning assets growth would we assume again it goes back to the deposit question right because your outlook has felt very conservative since you first put it out but what ph interest asset growth range should we assume lies underneath this nii guide david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so you have to take the pieces and look at it so theres not an appreciable change there weve got two things working one we ought to have pretty good loan growth as weve mentioned exppp and runoff portfolio regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 thats to growth in the loan balances but then weve got the billion to billion of deposits going the other way and so the cash will come down so its not as much as an earning asset changes it is mix and what the carry what the yield is on the net assets that we earning assets that we do have and so we should see our margin continuing to increase were trying to give you the guide by telling you that by the time we get to the fourth quarter our nii is higher than where we are today kind of cutting to the chase because theres a lot of moving parts there erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc no understood thanks david operator your next question will come from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities please proceed with your question peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning i wanted to ask about enerbank the economic environment has changed quite a bit since you guys acquired them and i was wondering have your views changed at all with regards to the loan outlook from enerbank or any consideration maybe further tightening the underwriting standards given a much higher rate environment david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp no were very bullish on enerbank were excited about the fact that we closed that in the fourth quarter if you look at our growth of enerbank this quarter it was obviously if you annualize that its which is below the guide that we gave you and the big driver there is seasonality so this first quarter is the low watermark for them youll see that pick up this is a prime book were really excited about the carry that we can get there and the margin we are ahead of schedule on where we thought we would be and so peter absolutely not we are looking to that to be a good component of our growth and again we feel good about the credit quality in particular being paid for the risk that were taking and a nice return for our shareholders on the capital deployed in that book peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it and then if i could just ask about the capital management strategies going forward just between bolton acquisitions and which have really increased profitability versus buybacks i saw yesterday youve got a billion buyback now the question is how aggressive will you be or is it just being opportunistic and just want to have that authorization in place david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 sure so lets go back through how we think about capital deployment first and foremost our capital is there for organic growth its to support our business as i mentioned exppp and runoff we got loans growing to thats where we want our capital to go first and foremost the second is we want to make sure we pay an appropriate dividend to our shareholders our guide is to of earnings in the form of a dividend so as earnings grow so will the dividend we then think about non bank acquisitions and the three we closed in the fourth quarter are great examples we have a whole team continuing to look and work with our three business segment leaders on how we can provide products and services that we dont have to our customers so well continue to do that and then we use share repurchases as the mechanism to maintain capital at the optimum level and that optimum level is informed by things like ccar and how we think about risk in our book and of course we just filed our ccar submission in april well hear back in the end of june on that and yes we did ask the board and received approval for billion share repurchase program over the next couple of years the control factor there peter is cet1 that needs to be in the range of to thats what our risk profile tells us we need to have cet1 in that range were targeting the middle of it at and so we wont buy shares back if it takes us outside of our operating range even if the price were right which is where youre going opportunistically i think thats just to help us manage our capital at the optimum level because that informs the denominator of our return on capital calculation which we think is critically important to our shareholders peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc great very helpful and just one housekeeping just how much was the credit interest recovery this quarter and net interest income david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp i didnt commit that to memory hold on just a minute ill tell you its at the bottom of the page peter well get that to you peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp youre talking about the impact to nii right peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc yeah regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp interest recovery and nii peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc yeah david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah that well look somebody look that up well get to you in a minute peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks david thanks for taking the questions operator your next question will come from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed with your questions matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning you did mention earlier about some consideration in your reserves for inflation and i do want to ask you always talk about your average account size being a bit smaller than some of your peers and i guess logic would have it that that customer base might be a little more impacted by inflation by rising energy gas prices and just wondering what youre seeing on some of those call it leading indicators that would be helpful thanks john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah matt hey this is john i would just say so far not a lot of change generally speaking our customer base we look at deposit balances the impact of covid and relief dollars on customer deposit balances we saw on average even in the lowest balance segment about a increase in to increase in prepandemic deposit balances and we are still seeing customers maintaining that level of excess liquidity as evidenced by the fact that our deposit balances actually grew quarteroverquarter we do are aware of the impact of inflation or the likely impact of inflation on our customer base it is a more mass markets customer base as weve talked about before about a of our consumer deposit customers are in the mass market so there will be some impact and were certainly watching for that but we havent seen it yet matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then i guess on the other side of the loan book in the commercial side you had a big drop in nonperforming loans big drop in the criticized assets was that anything specific like a couple of borrowers or sectors or it has been improving for some time but it has gotten quite low regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah no i think its broad based and we continue to see improvement in credit quality across the book a reduction in criticized loans classified loans and nonperforming assets i think it reflects the work that our teams have continued to do working with our customers closely to evaluate the risk in our portfolios to exit certain relationships portfolios and businesses where we feel like that we are seeing increased amounts of risk or were not getting an appropriate return if i had to point to any business where or businesses portfolios where we saw improvement it would be restaurant as we continue to work out of that portfolio and hotel as the economy recovers through the pandemic matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you operator your next question will come from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your question john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hey hey good morning hi everybody so just a followup on the fee side now that youre getting close to the implementation of your changes to the deposit products and youre continuing to reiterate your service charges expectations for and service charges are actually probably better than people expected in the first quarter so just wanted to kind of get your updated views on your confidence that youve got the right outlook and as you start to put the products in place like what are your early takeaways from the continuation of that view david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so our service charge were a little better than anticipated i will say that weve put in some changes at the end of the first quarter youll see more change coming in the second and third where so its too early to change our guidance that we gave you last quarter we reiterated it this quarter which was million for service charges in and million in the next year as we go through and see what the impact is for these changes well update that whichever way it might go and well probably have a better feel for the year next earnings call but right now its prior to early change it ken usdin q analyst jefferies company yeah understood okay and then one just followup on credit just following up on matts question about your provisioning cost but can you just talk about as you talked about normalization of losses starting to happen towards the back half of the year what parts of the portfolio are you expecting to see chargeoffs increase in first regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 and what areas are you just noticing that potential change in terms of delinquencies and loss rates thanks david david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well i think that we lowered our range basis points to basis points as we think about risk going forward theres certainly the consumer on the consumer side of the house there has been a lot of stimulus money i think we feel pretty good about the consumer but thats an area we need to watch closely to see where that starts to move first the second piece of that would be small business i think small business is an area that probably has on a relative basis incremental risk the issue is were just not seeing any of that right now john had mentioned all of our asset quality indicators are getting better we believe our normalized loss rate is as likely to be lower than our history because of our derisking that we just mentioned in our whole credit book so we feel pretty good about that i think the leverage book we want to watch closely as well as we see rates increasing and what kind of pressure might that put on the leveraged portfolios so those would be two or three that we watch ken usdin q analyst jefferies company all right thank you david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp i do want to get back peter you asked about the recovery that was in nii its million this quarter i want to close that out operator your next question will come from the line of john pancari with evercore isi please proceed with your question john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning on the expense side i want to see if i can kind of ask the opposite of chris spahrs question earlier wondering what type of expense flexibility you may have if the revenue backdrop comes in weaker than expected this year and do you still think that that youre implying about basis points of positive operating leverage in your guidance is that sustainable if the revenue backdrop gets tougher david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 well so you saw a pretty good quarter this quarter again make sure you add back the million on the hr to get level set there the reason we were down is because our revenue was down in certain areas like capital markets that has a tendency to be more variable in terms of the cost relative to the revenue things like ma if you dont have ma transactions then you dont have the compensation that goes with the deal so it depends where the revenue challenges come from john if were seeing it in places like that then we should have lower compensation mortgage if we dont have the mortgage production that we think then youre going to see lower compensation for that as well so we do have some mechanism to take care of revenue if its lower than we thought and a big driver of our change in weve changed i guess two times now our revenue outlook has been because of the rate environment and just more carry there so if we have if we dont get the rate increases that the forwards imply implied at march which is whats baked into our guidance then were probably going to have a lower incentive compensation so there are puts and takes there we still feel confident with the operating leverage number that you just mentioned thats exactly whats baked into our guidance and we will we are committed to having operating leverage over time john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thanks david thats helpful and then on the loans side as you look at the remainder of the year in terms of overall growth drivers where do you see the strongest loan generation coming out of both on the commercial side and the consumer side what are the biggest drivers of growth over the remainder of this year as you look at the economic backdrop john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp john this is john turner our growth in the last quarter and frankly over the last i guess two or three quarters has been broad based across all three segments so were experiencing growth in our corporate banking business our middle market commercial business and our real estate business were seeing customers access lines of credit at increasing rates to both rebuild inventories and to adjust to increasing cost associated with inventories so obviously increases in line utilization are both inventory and cost driven were also seeing some capex which im excited about across a number of different industries customers are investing in expansion activities some of it is for modernization and recognition of a much tighter labor market in alabama unemployments in georgia its florida and tennessee at so were at full employment across some very good markets and as a result customers are looking for ways to modernize and to continue to borrow growth in the portfolio has come in health care it has come in transportation it has come in our technology and defense sectors and assetbased lending in the real estate business weve seen some growth in homebuilder as markets are again continuing to expand as a result of consistent inmigration of people also seeing some growth in our real estate investment trust business which has been an important portfolio for us and a really highly regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 performing portfolio so we are optimistic about our ability to continue to grow through the balance of the year and we expect that growth to be fairly broad based john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right john thank you john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you operator your next question will come from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed with your question betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning betsy hey betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey i had a couple of questions one is i just want to make sure i understand how you are positioning yourself for this surged deposit activity that you outlined on slide i know you put the expected beta of to for the mid stable mid beta and to for the least stable higher beta is that your indication to us of what you think it would take to retain these deposits and would you go after them or are you saying look we think it would retain this and were not going to go after them or it depends on how it progresses could you just give us some color on that david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp i think if you look at the if youre on that page lets start with the right hand side those are the higher beta to id characterize those as nonoperational corporate deposits these are deposits that are parked here that probably are going to seek a better avenue a better yield than were willing to pay for so you could expect those to most likely move off the balance sheet first when you get to the middle which is at to beta those are accounts that has stimulus or small business accounts with a disproportionate amount of cash in their accounts that we think will normalize over time i think youll see a little bit of both youll see some of that move off the balance sheet youll see some of that where well pay a higher price but at the end of the day were going to have to monitor that we have a deposit rate committee this is what they do every month they meet to try to figure out what we should pay regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 as you know our deposit beta was among the lowest of the peer group we expect that to be true going forward because of our granular high primacy deposit base so that one has that middle billion is something were going to have to watch closely to see whether it stays on and if it does what will it cost us there is going to be an avenue for both of these that is in the middle column in the right for offbalance sheet opportunities where well move those out of the bank but well be able to have a fee associated with that that will help compensate us a little bit wont cover what were earning today or likely earning as rates move up but nonetheless itll be a bit of a carry for us going forward betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then since were looking for bps up in right in may and june basis points each we should start to see some of this surge deposit exit in shouldnt we or i read that wrong david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah no i think youre exactly right i think again when its basis points that may have been different basis points if youre a large corporation has nonoperational deposits youre going to be moving pretty quickly so again we expected to billion to billion that we talked about to move off in the first quarter it did not now our corporate deposits were about flat on an average basis we do expect that after this basis points for that to start happening so yes you would expect deposits to be down in the second quarter as a result of that betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just two other things one is what factors will drive you to shift your excess cash to securities are you going to be waiting to get through like of the fed funds rate hikes to assess and then redeploy or are you going to be redeploying along the way david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp well i think weve redeployed some so weve put billion to work this last quarter as spreads continue to actually gap out a bit things like cmbs agency cmbs was a good place for us i guess we put at what was billion if we were to do that today itd be closer to billion so its kind of a little bit of again we need to just watch and see what the rate environment will give us we do have some cash we can put to work if our beta assumptions are better then well have that much more cash to deploy over time now our guidance were giving you doesnt have that does not have that baked into the guidance but using the spot securities and the forward starting swaps all thats baked into our hedging strategy that were trying to put in place so that we can protect a really nice margin that we think we can get to over time and weve given you that guidance on one of our slides slide and i think in our prerecorded message we think we can push up to with a fed fund so thatd be quite nice for us regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and last question is just on you had the aoci hit i know its gerard spoke about that with you earlier on the call the long end of the curve obviously is up since march so should we expect like for the dv01 hit in this quarter would be similar to last quarter for a like dv01 move or are some of these hedging strategies that you indicated early are changing that and really im asking what we need to take into consideration as we think through to with this rate back up what the aoci hit could be david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so my first point would be to ignore it and you dont have to do the math indiscernible something else but if you want to track it for whatever reason that you have i would expect it to probably negatively impact us but not to the tune of what it did this past quarter partially because of what were legging into right now and frankly the change in the long end isnt going to be as we dont think be as severe as it was this quarter so good luck with your math happy for betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc but those hedging strategies you talked about earlier help you on that front is that an accurate statement or not david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah thats right betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right thanks operator your final question will come from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed with your question bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning thank you for taking my questions following up on your response to both gerard and betsy i appreciate your comments around how it doesnt make any fundamental economic sense to mark securities to fair value on the left hand side of your balance sheet without also marking the deposits to fair value on the right side and so fundamentally available for sale oci hits are nothing more than accounting noise regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 but how would you respond to the idea that in the recession bank stocks are going to trade down the tangible book value and so while it may not matter fundamentally from a practical perspective its something that investors tend to care about david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah this whole concept of tangible book value came about in the recession to the extent we have a recession the rate environment is actually going to go the other way and securities are going to be worth that much more and so again i think if you want to mark the entire balance sheet to fair value that would be reasonable especially in trying times where youre trying to figure out what the true fair value of net assets are for a given company but that whole concept to tangible book value my opinion is really not a going concern issue its a failure notion its im going out of business what might i get as a shareholder if we liquidate everything and the biggest issue i have with oci is youre marking one element of the entire balance sheet securities youre not marking loans youre not marking deposits or anything else so youre not getting a very good understanding of what true tangible book value is in any rate scenario and i realize im in the minority and people just do are going to do what they want but in a recession it actually goes the other way because the rates will be down bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood yeah that makes sense you guys have exhibited prowess in protecting your margins through the hedging program i guess is there anything that could lead you to ever consider wanting to protect that tangible book or maybe since it is a focus of investors maybe introducing the tangible book value ex the available for sale might be something that people focus on because i guess with the passage of time goes indiscernible would not be realized if you hold the securities to maturity david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah i i dont again we dont use this to manage our bank at all we dont use it for capital we dont use for rating agencies so to put it in held to maturity where we dont have to have a mark all that does is restrict our ability to manage the portfolio the way we want and so we dont see any need for that we do realize there are some people for whatever reason that this is important and all im saying is go calculate the fair value of our deposits which will be in our 10q coming up and just add that in as youre thinking about tangible book value and then we at least have a better idea of what it is bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thank you for taking my questions regions financial corp rf corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 john m
