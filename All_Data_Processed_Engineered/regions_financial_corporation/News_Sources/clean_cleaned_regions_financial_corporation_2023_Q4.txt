kyle puchta is up well before dawn most days poring over weather forecasts that regions financial purchases from a private contractor based in norway whenever there is a hurricane tornado or other disaster coming the banks way he sends a am email to prep colleagues on how to get ready the 59yearold puchta a senior vice president in corporate security at regions is the point man for a unit of employees known inside the bank as the swat team or the weather team the role wasnt intended to focus on weather when puchta started it in but he spends at least half of his time on it these days we never have an off time puchta said in an interview at the regions operations center housed in an office park miles south of the bank headquarters in birmingham ala sometimes his earlymorning emails are the start of swift action branches must be boarded up mobile units and atms must be sent to areas where the power went out the reports also inform the banks longerterm planning executives review them for clues on how natural disasters will affect the balance sheet now and years in the future it is just one piece of the banks attempt to adjust to a planet where extreme weather is becoming more commonplace even when there are no alerts for the weather team to monitor and the bank gets thousands each year there is a disaster playbook to refine and quarterly weather reports to put together the possibilities it must consider are numerous customers whose businesses or properties are destroyed households that cant get homeowners insurance havoc in the oilandgas industry for chief executive john turner preparing for climate change is a matter of math we lend money he said and we want to make sure we get paid back regions is an oldschool southern bank not known for flashy technology or a major presence on wall street its branches run across hurricane country in the southeast and parts of tornado alley in the midwest as well as states such as texas that are prone to all kinds of extreme weather companies of all types are at risk from supercharged heat waves storms floods and wildfires some are already turning their whole business upside down the fishermen who switch to kelp farming when the lobsters move north the burger joint that must keep kitchen employees cool when the air conditioner breaks down in tripledigit heat banks at the very least will have to make bets on how trillions of dollars in loans will hold up against climate change they may have to reassess which businesses and households they can afford to do business with and where shifts that would ripple through the economy big global banks are taking an expansive approach to the issue of climate change believing they have an important role in stopping it by redirecting lending and pushing clients to make changes regions is doing more than other banks of its size but it hasnt exactly reworked its whole business model a large part of its approach is simply planning out how loans might go bad or how many branches and atms might be destroyed in a storm executives said climatechange risks havent stopped the bank from lending to certain industries like oil and gas or in certain places and the bank hasnt announced a pledge to for example become carbon neutral but regions has changed the way it underwrites and monitors loans executives said bankers have to consider how exposed a property is to floods or other disasters before they make a loan for example or whether a company has timber tracts or oil fields concentrated in one area the bank is also watching how insurance could affect the businesses and households that it banks since many are finding it much harder and more expensive to get property insurance if you were to ask me what keeps you up at night it would be realestate lending and risk on the mortgage side said kate danella head of consumer banking at regions bigbutnothuge banks like regions are already under pressure this year from high interest rates and new capital rules and several midsize banks collapsed earlier this year that makes tamping down on risk without cutting into profits more important last month federal regulators for the first time rolled out rules on how banks with more than billion in assets including regions should prepare for risks related to climate change the federal reserve has asked six of the largest banks including jpmorgan chase and bank of america to go a few steps further by mapping out their ability to handle different climate scenarios some other big regional banks have started to think about how to model climate risk though those efforts are in early stages the us banking industry mentioned climate change in at least calls or securities filings in compared with more than a year earlier according to factiva data in much of the decade before banks mentioned it on a few dozen calls or filings a year at most mother nature isnt exactly easy to predict so preparing for weatherrelated losses isnt either in for example regions initially estimated losses from hurricane katrina would be around million but they turned out to be less than million last year the bank put away million for hurricane ian which hit florida then reversed it the next quarter having lowerthanexpected losses isnt bad but those reserves drag on profits its hard to be precise and thats why we believe that being conservative and hanging up a bigger reserve early on is better for our customers and our shareholders said regions chief financial officer david turner who isnt related to the ceo just go ahead and take your medicine regions named climate change as a risk factor in its annual filing with securities regulators as early as the phrase now appears in that filing a dozen times you cant not recognize that we are seeing more severe climaterelated events john turner said weatherrelated events other natural or manmade disasters climate change and the transition to a lowercarbon economy pose shorter and longerterm risks to our business the bank wrote in its most recent annual filing with the securities and exchange commission and are expected to increase over time
