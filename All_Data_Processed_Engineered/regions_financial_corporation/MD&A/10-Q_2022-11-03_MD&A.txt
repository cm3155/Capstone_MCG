residential first mortgage residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a residence these loans are typically financed over a to year term and in most cases are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence these loans increased million in comparison to yearend balances the increase is primarily due to a decline in prepayment rate and an increase in arm

increased by million compared to the second quarter of nonperforming loans excluding held for sale and nonperforming assets also increased by million and million respectively compared to the second quarter of regions september baseline forecast deteriorated slightly compared to the june forecast driven by a small decline in real gdp growth the september baseline forecast continues to anticipate real gdp growth in supported primarily by consumer spending and business investments in equipment machinery and intellectual property with potential for further support from infrastructure spending to

to doubledigit levels experienced in recent quarters as measured by cpi inflation is expected to remain above the fomcs percent target for the remainder of and into furthermore ongoing disruptions in

and external data available the table below reflects a range of macroeconomic factors utilized in the base forecast over the twoyear rs forecast period as of september the unemployment rate is the

regions footprint especially florida and south carolina the hurricane caused significant flood and wind damage resulting in loss of life property and power due to the proximity of the hurricane to quarterend regions is still assessing all aspects of the impact to customers a full evaluation of the stormrelated impact may take several months as such the availability of additional or different information affecting customers in the hurricaneimpacted areas could cause the allowance to be increased or decreased in future periods while regions quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of imprecision the qualitative framework has a general imprecision component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are inherent in any modeling estimate the september general imprecision allowance remained relatively flat compared to the second quarter of and reflects continued uncertainty in the economic environment heightened financial volatility and supply chain issues based on the overall analysis performed management deemed an allowance of billion to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan and credit commitment portfolios as of september details regarding the allowance and net chargeoffs including an analysis of activity from the

other banking and financial services companies for a share of the deposit market regions ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the company meets customers needs regions employs various means to meet those needs and enhance competitiveness such as providing a high level of customer service and competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers regions also serves customers through providing centralized highquality banking services through the companys digital channels and contact center the following table summarizes deposits by category table 14deposits september december in millions noninterestbearing demand interestbearing checking savings money marketdomestic time deposits total deposits total deposits at september decreased approximately billion compared to yearend levels as trends have largely returned to the seasonal deposit patterns observed prior to the pandemic the declines in noninterest bearing demand and interestbearing checking accounts were primarily driven by corporate and wealth management customers continuing to reduce excess balances accumulated over the past two years with recent increases in market interest rates corporate customers have experienced some remixing into higheryielding deposit accounts which contributed to the increases in savings and money market accounts consumer balances have increased across all account types due to seasonality which partially offset the declines in noninterestbearing demand and interestbearing checking accounts and further contributed to the increases in savings and money market accounts the decrease in time deposits was driven by a decline in accounts acquired through enerbank as these deposits are not being

of income and is one of the most important elements of regions ability to meet its overall performance goals both net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by market interest rates and in the first nine months of the fomc increased the fed funds rate by basis points with the potential for additional rate increases in the remaining quarter of net interest income taxableequivalent basis increased in the third quarter and first nine months of compared to the same periods in the increases in net interest income were driven primarily by higher interest rates and continued average loan growth which included consumer home improvement loans from the fourth quarter acquisition of enerbank also contributing to the increases were larger securities portfolio balances increases in average deposit balances and costs as well as a decline in ppp forgiveness income in the third quarter and the first nine months of partially offset the increases to net interest income net interest margin also increased in the third quarter and first nine months of compared to the same periods in driven primarily by higher market interest rates and the addition of higheryielding consumer home improvement loans from the acquisition of enerbank in the fourth quarter of also contributing to the increases were declining cash balances and contractual loan and cash repricing outpacing the increase in deposit costs see the third quarter overview section for the companys expectations for interest income as a component of total revenue see also the market riskinterest rate risk section below for additional information market riskinterest rate risk regions primary market risk is interest rate risk this includes uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest rate levels which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the company offers to quantify this risk regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful shortterm indicator of regions interest rate risk sensitivity measurementfinancial simulation models are regions primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of regions balance sheet assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic plans and from customer behavior among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business interest raterelated risks are expressly considered such as pricing spreads the pricing of deposit accounts prepayments and other option risks regions considers these factors as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior the primary objective of assetliability management at regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles in computing interest rate sensitivity for measurement regions compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates the standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus and minus and basis points in addition to parallel curve shifts multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are contemplated regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements phased in over a sixmonth period that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements exposure to interest rate movementsas of september regions was asset sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as compared to the base case for the 12month measurement horizon ending september the estimated exposure associated with the rising and falling rate scenarios in the table below reflects the combined impacts of movements in shortterm and longterm interest rates currently net interest income is projected to benefit from rising shortterm interest rates ie asset sensitive profile an increase or reduction in shortterm interest rates such as the fed funds rate the rate of interest on excess reserves 1month libor sofr and bsby will drive the yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such rates higher or lower under either environment it is expected that changes in funding costs and balance sheet hedging income will only somewhat offset the change in asset yields importantly the potential to retain surge deposits with lower than expected repricing behavior represents an opportunity for further net interest income growth in the increasing rate scenario as well in the third quarter of regions experienced a slight decline in lowcost deposits acquired through the pandemic retention of these deposits remains uncertain and some amount may be more rate sensitive in a rising rate environment therefore additional sensitivity analysis focused on pandemicrelated surge deposit pricing behavior and retention is outlined in table net interest income remains exposed to intermediate yield curve tenors while this was a headwind to net interest income during the pandemic it represents a tailwind to net interest income growth as the yield curve rises an increase in intermediate and longterm interest rates such as intermediate to longerterm us treasuries swap and mortgage rates will drive yields higher on certain fixed rate newly originated or renewed loans increase prospective yields on certain investment portfolio purchases and reduce amortization of premium expense on existing securities in the investment portfolio the opposite is true in an environment where intermediate and longterm interest rates fall the interest rate sensitivity analysis presented below in table is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve though there are many assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income those pertaining to deposit pricing deposit mix and overall balance sheet composition are particularly impactful given the uncertainties associated with monetary policy tightening on the pace of interest rate movement and industry liquidity levels management evaluates the impact to its sensitivity analysis from these key assumptions sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future results the companys baseline balance sheet assumptions include managements best estimate for balance sheet growth in the coming months the behavior of pandemicrelated surge deposits under a rising rate scenario is uncertain since yearend the last periodend free from the effects of the pandemic deposit balances have increased by approximately billion exclusive of deposits acquired in the enerbank acquisition and approximately billion of the increase was determined to be attributable to pandemicrelated surge deposits therefore table includes two balance sheet scenarios to help inform a potential range of outcomes the first is an opportunity scenario and assumes that these deposits behave more like stable legacy balances which is consistent with historical disclosures the second scenario assumes that these depositors will be more sensitive to rate requiring a higher interest rate in order to hold their balances with the bank these deposits including noninterest bearing products are attributed with an approximate percent repricing beta in rising rate scenarios but assumes an accelerated attrition profile importantly the impact to net interest income under a changing rate environment is the same whether the surge deposit balances are held at a higher beta or the balances attrite and the funding is replaced with wholesale sources given the evolving nature of the environment estimates have been conservatively derived should the balances remain with the company longer or demonstrate less sensitivity to interest rates there is potential for upside eg the opportunity scenario the disclosure in table does not prescribe a view as to the longevity of surge deposits on the balance sheet the behavior of deposit pricing in response to changes in interest rate levels is largely informed by analyses of prior rate cycles in both the base case and the scenario one gradual basis point shock scenarios in table interestbearing deposits reprice using an approximately to percent cumulative beta the deposit beta model is dynamic across both interest rate level and time again the surge deposit interestbearing deposit beta is bookended in each scenario assuming legacy betas and a percent beta respectively deposit pricing outperformance or underperformance of percent in that scenario would increase or decrease net interest income by approximately million respectively in rising rate scenarios only management assumes that the mix of legacy deposits will change versus the base case as informed by analyses of prior rate cycles management assumes that in rising rate scenarios some shift from noninterest bearing to interestbearing products will occur the magnitude of the shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately billion over months in the gradual basis point scenario in table the table below summarizes regions positioning over the next months in various parallel yield curve shifts ie including all yield curve tenors the scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate hedging activities some forwardstarting swaps have starting dates beyond the next months therefore while the impact of hedges on reported exposure is limited they will meaningfully reduce the net interest income sensitivity to changes in market interest rates over the coming year as they enter the measurement window more information regarding hedges is disclosed in table and its accompanying description table 20interest rate sensitivity scenario one estimated annual change in net interest income september scenario two estimated annual change in net interest income september in millions

hedges reflected within the measurement horizon see table for additional information regarding hedge start and maturity dates scenario one assumes all deposits including surge deposits perform consistently with historical experiences scenario two accounts for uncertainty in surge deposit balances approximately billion as of by assuming an accelerated attrition profile and and an approximate beta on a declining amount of surge deposits regions comprehensive interest rate risk management approach uses derivatives as discussed further below and debt securities to manage its interest rate risk position as a result of the following transactions executed during the third quarter of the company was able to add incremental asset sensitivity in the nearterm and extend incremental downside rate protection over a longer horizon at the beginning of the third quarter the company terminated billion in notional originally scheduled to mature at quarter end also during the quarter the company repositioned existing cash flow swaps by unwinding and replacing billion of notional to extend interest rate protection by lengthening the weighted average maturity by eight months in addition to the repositioning the company entered into additional forwardstarting cash flow hedges to add protection during periods of time when the balance sheet is more exposed to interest rate declines which included million in forwardstarting cash flow swaps that begin in january with six month maturities and billion in forwardstarting cash flow swaps that begin in with three year maturities these additional hedges have a weighted average receivefixed rate of percent paying overnight sofr subsequent to september the company continued to add cash flow hedges as a part of its hedging strategy regions entered into billion in forwardstarting cash flow swaps that begin in with six month maturities and also entered into billion in forwardstarting cash flow swaps that begin in with three year maturities the weighted average receivefixed rates on these cash flow hedges was percent paying overnight sofr interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of regions securities portfolio which can directly impact the carrying value of shareholders equity derivatives regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity alco which consists of members of regions senior management team in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with customer derivatives which include interest rate credit and foreign exchange risks the most common derivatives regions employs are forward rate contracts eurodollar futures contracts interest rate swaps options on interest rate swaps interest rate caps and floors and forward sale commitments forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield a eurodollar futures contract is a future on a eurodollar deposit eurodollar futures contracts subject regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates because futures contracts are cash settled daily there is minimal credit risk associated with eurodollar futures interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable or vice versa streams of interest payments the notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreedupon price foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate these contracts are executed on behalf of the companys customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform regions has made use of interest rate swaps and floors in balance sheet hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixedrate funding position to a variablerate position to effectively convert a portion of its fixedrate debt securities available for sale portfolio to a variablerate position and to effectively convert a portion of its floatingrate loan

by us and our customers the growing use of mobile cloud and other emerging technologies and the increasing sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external parties or fraud on the part of employees even when regions successfully prevents cyber attacks to its own network the company may still incur losses that result from customers account information being obtained through breaches of retailers networks that enable customer transactions the related fraud losses as well as the costs of reissuing new cards may impact regions financial results in addition regions also relies on some vendors to provide certain business infrastructure components and although regions actively assesses and monitors the information security capabilities of these vendors regions reliance on them may also increase exposure to information security risk in the event of a cyber attack or other data breach regions may be required to incur
