item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis is part of regions financial corporations regions or the company quarterly report on s health pandemics government stimulus and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts floods and hurricanes management considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the allowance these variables and others have the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts the allowance totaled billion at june compared to billion at december which represents managements best estimate of expected losses over the life of the loan and credit commitment portfolios key drivers of the change in the allowance are presented in table below while many of these items overlap regarding impact they are included in the category most relevant table allowance changes three

an immaterial associated allowance this balance includes million related to the initial allowance for nonpcd loans acquired as part of the ascentium acquisition impact included only for the quarter of acquisition regions adopted the cecl accounting guidance on january and recorded the cumulative effect of the change in accounting guidance as a reduction to retained earnings and an increase to deferred tax assets in the first quarter of credit metrics are monitored throughout the quarter in order to understand external macroviews trends and industry outlooks as well as regions internal specific views of credit metrics and trends the second quarter of exhibited strong asset quality performance reflecting broadbased improvements across most portfolios commercial and investor real estate criticized balances decreased approximately million classified balances decreased million and total net chargeoffs decreased million compared to the first quarter of nonperforming loans excluding held for sale decreased approximately million compared to the first quarter of while nonperforming assets increased modestly additionally mortgage ltvs are holding up well and the hpi showed robust appreciation regions continued to perform a bottomup review of loan portfolios during the second quarter of which resulted in fewer sectors considered highrisk compared to the first quarter of as of june billion of commercial and investor real estate loans are in covid19 highrisk industry segments a decline of million from march refer to the portfolio characteristics section for more information about the highrisk industries as the credit risk within regions loan portfolio continues to be evaluated both negative and positive factors of the economic landscape were considered in determining the allowance estimate as economic activity accelerated due to widespread reopening of the economy the second quarter of showed continued signs of economic improvement regions june forecast was relatively consistent with the march forecast with the exception of hpi which saw meaningful increases regions economic forecast utilized in the june allowance estimate considered sustained reopening of the economy further vaccine distribution and continued increases in consumer spending on goods and services refer to the economic environment in regions banking markets within the second quarter overview section for more information furthermore regions benchmarked its internal forecast with external forecasts and external data available the table below reflects a range of macroeconomic factors utilized in the base forecast over the twoyear rs forecast period as of june the unemployment rate is the most significant macroeconomic factor among the cecl models unemployment

annualized change unemployment rate hpi yearoveryear change sp the continued improvement in the economic forecast due to vaccine deployment the impact of expected chargeoffs previously provided for lower expectations of future credit losses and credit improvement described above were significant drivers of the modeled decreases in the allowance while regions quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of imprecision the qualitative framework has a general imprecision component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are inherent in any modeling estimate the june general imprecision allowance was reduced compared to the first quarter of but continues to reflect managements caution with respect to the modeled reductions in the allowance given the uncertainty surrounding the pace of economic recovery including the potential for higher inflation as the changing status of the pandemic unfolds based on the overall analysis performed management deemed an allowance of billion to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan and credit commitment portfolios as of june details regarding the allowance and net chargeoffs including an analysis of activity from the previous years totals are included in table allowance for credit losses as noted above economic trends such as interest rates unemployment volatility in commodity prices inflation and collateral valuations as well as the length and depth of the covid19 pandemic and the impact of the cares act and other policy accommodations will impact the future levels of net chargeoffs and may result in volatility of certain credit metrics during the remainder of and beyond table 9allowance

reconciliation troubled debt restructurings tdrs tdrs are modified loans in which a concession is provided to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty as provided initially in the cares act passed into law on march and subsequently extended through the consolidated appropriations act signed into law on december certain loan modifications related to the covid19 pandemic beginning march through the earlier of days after the end of the pandemic or january are eligible for relief from tdr classification regions elected this provision of both acts therefore modified loans that met the required guidelines for relief are not considered tdrs and are excluded from the disclosures below under regions covid19 deferral and forbearance programs customer payments are deferred for a period of time typically days upon expiration of the deferral period customers may apply for additional relief or resume making payments on their loans repayment plans for the deferrals differ depending on the loan type and repayment ability of the borrower the tdr relief and shortterm nature of most covid19 deferrals precluded these modifications from being classified as tdrs as of june residential first mortgage home equity consumer credit card and other consumer tdrs are consumer loans modified under the cap commercial and investor real estate loan modifications are not the result of a formal program but represent situations where modifications were offered as a workout alternative renewals of classified commercial and investor real estate loans are considered to be tdrs even if no

transfers to held for sale regions may remove loans from tdr classification if the following conditions are met the borrowers financial condition improves such that the borrower is no longer in financial difficulty the loan has not had any forgiveness of principal or interest the loan has not been restructured as an a noteb note the loan has been reported as a tdr over one fiscal yearend and the loan is subsequently refinanced or restructured at market terms such that it qualifies as a new loan for the consumer portfolio changes in tdrs are primarily due to additions from cap modifications and outflows from payments and chargeoffs given the types of concessions currently being granted under the cap as detailed in note loans and the allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements regions does not expect that the market interest rate condition will be widely achieved therefore regions expects consumer loans modified through cap to continue to be identified as tdrs for the remaining term of the loan table 12analysis of changes in commercial and investor real estate tdrs six months ended june six months ended june commercial investor real

respectively goodwill goodwill totaled billion at both june and december and is allocated to each of regions reportable segments each a reporting unit at which level goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more often if events and circumstances indicate the fair value of the reporting unit may have declined below the carrying value refer to note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in the annual report on form 10k for the year ended december for further discussion of when regions tests goodwill for impairment and the companys methodology and valuation approaches used to determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit the result of the assessment performed for the second quarter of did not indicate that the estimated fair values of the companys reporting units corporate bank consumer bank and wealth management had declined below their respective carrying values therefore regions determined that a test of goodwill impairment was not required for any of regions reporting units for the june interim period deposits regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a share of the deposit market regions ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the company meets customers needs regions employs various means to meet those needs and enhance competitiveness such as providing a high level of customer service and competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers regions also serves customers through providing centralized highquality banking services and the companys digital channels and contact center the following table summarizes deposits by category table 15deposits june december in millions noninterestbearing demand savings interestbearing transaction money marketdomestic time deposits customer deposits corporate treasury time deposits total deposits at june increased approximately billion compared to yearend levels driven by increases in categories other than customer time deposits increases across categories were primarily driven by an increase in customer deposit balances due to recent government stimulus payments and new account growth also contributing to noninterest bearing demand growth is an increase in deposits from business customers who continued to retain excess liquidity customer time deposits decreased due to maturities and continued lower interest rates resulted in a decrease in the utilization of time deposit accounts

requirements established by federal and state banking agencies these regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the companys assets liabilities and selected offbalance sheet items and also qualitative judgments by the regulators failure to meet minimum capital requirements can subject the company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions under the basel iii rules regions is designated as a standardized approach bank additional discussion of the basel iii rules their applicability to regions recent proposals and final rules issued by the federal banking agencies and recent laws enacted that impact regulatory requirements is included in the supervision and regulation subsection of the business section in the annual report on form 10k and the

to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report on form 10k in the third quarter of the federal banking agencies finalized a rule related to the impact of cecl on regulatory capital requirements the rule allows an addback to regulatory capital for the impacts of cecl for a twoyear period at the end of the two years the impact is then phasedin over the following three years the addback is calculated as the impact of initial adoption adjusted for percent of subsequent changes in the allowance at june the impact of the addback on cet1 was approximately million or approximately

rule change at implementation the scb replaced the current capital conservation buffer which was a static percent in addition to the minimum riskweighted asset ratios shown above during the third quarter of and in connection with the results of its supervisory stress test released in june the federal reserve finalized regions scb requirement for the fourth quarter of through the third quarter of at percent the percent requirement represented the amount of capital degradation under the supervisory severely adverse scenario inclusive of four quarters of planned common stock dividends in december the federal reserve disclosed the results of its supervisory stress test associated with the capital plan resubmission while the federal reserve did not recalibrate scbs as a part of the resubmission for participating banks regions implied scb would have been floored at percent based on capital degradation in the supervisory severely adverse scenario had the scb been updated the decision to update scb requirements based on the resubmission results was initially deferred to march and subsequently deferred again to june regions chose to participate in ccar in part to have the

shareholders equity and related ratios regions believes that expressing earnings and certain other financial measures excluding these significant items provides a meaningful basis for periodtoperiod comparisons which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the company and predicting future performance these nongaap financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of regions business because management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations regions believes that presentation of these nongaap financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the company on the same basis as that applied by management management and the board utilize these nongaap financial measures as follows preparation of regions operating budgets monthly financial performance reporting monthly closeout reporting of consolidated results management only presentations

from net interest margin gaap the adjusted efficiency ratio nongaap which is a measure of productivity is generally calculated as adjusted noninterest expense divided by adjusted total revenue on a

shareholders equity ratios have become a focus of some investors in analyzing the capital position of the company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock traditionally the federal reserve and other banking regulatory bodies have assessed a banks capital adequacy based on tier capital the calculation of which is codified in federal banking regulations analysts and banking regulators have assessed regions capital adequacy using the tangible common shareholders equity measure because tangible common shareholders equity is not formally defined by gaap this measure is considered to be a nongaap financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently than regions disclosed calculations since analysts and banking regulators may assess regions capital adequacy using tangible common shareholders equity regions believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess regions capital adequacy on this same basis nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited although these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap in particular a measure of earnings that excludes

for applicable state income taxes net of the related federal tax benefit net interest income decreased slightly for the second quarter compared to the same period in and increased slightly for the first six months of compared to the same period in net interest income declines from lower longterm rates have been offset by lower deposit and borrowing costs and active cash management strategies including billion of securities purchases in the second quarter of interest income on loans for the first three and six months of and was aided by the companys hedging strategy with benefits expanding as more notional became active throughout the hedges had a positive impact of approximately million for the first six months of compared to million in the same period of the declines in net interest margin for the second quarter and first six months of compared to the same periods in were primarily driven by continued elevated liquidity as indicated by higher cash balances regions continues to prudently manage its excess liquidity balances through extinguishments of longterm borrowings and securities purchases net interest margin for the second quarter and first six months of was negatively impacted by the repricing of fixedrate loan portfolios and the securities portfolio at lower market interest rates excluding the impact of ppp lending and excess cash which regions considers to be balances in excess of million adjusted net interest margin nongaap for the second quarter and the six months ended june compared to the same periods in declined modestly to and respectively while the second quarter of securities purchases benefited net interest income and net interest margin they reduced adjusted net interest margin see table gaap to nongaap reconciliations for a reconciliation of adjusted net interest margin net interest income exclusive of the impact from ppp loans and excess cash is expected to grow through the remainder of aided by hedging balance sheet management strategies and deposit rates furthermore longterm rate pressure is expected to become more neutral near yearend market riskinterest rate risk regions primary market risk is interest rate risk this includes uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest rate levels which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the company offers to quantify this risk regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful shortterm indicator of regions interest rate risk sensitivity measurement financial simulation models are regions primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of regions balance sheet assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic plans and from customer behavior among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business interest raterelated risks are expressly considered such as pricing spreads the pricing of deposit accounts prepayments and other option risks regions considers these factors as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior the primary objective of assetliability management at regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles in computing interest rate sensitivity for measurement regions compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates the standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus and basis points given low market rates by historical standards the company focuses on a falling rate shock scenario where all rates fall to levels consistent with historical minimums in addition to parallel curve shifts multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are contemplated regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements phased in over a sixmonth period that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements exposure to interest rate movements as of june regions was asset sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as compared to the base case for the 12month measurement horizon ending june the second quarter of continued the trend of strong growth in lowcost deposits and cash balances held with the federal reserve retention of these balance sheet liquidity inflows is uncertain and much of the recent deposit growth may be more rate sensitive under a rising rate scenario therefore additional sensitivity analysis focused on pandemicrelated surge deposit pricing behavior and retention is outlined in table the estimated exposure associated with the rising and falling rate scenarios in the table below reflects the combined impacts of movements in shortterm and longterm interest rates net interest income sensitivity to shortterm rates is approximately neutral when excluding pandemicrelated deposit increases an increase or reduction in shortterm interest rates such as the fed funds rate the rate of interest on excess reserves and 1month libor will drive the yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such rates higher or lower under either environment it is expected that changes in funding costs and balance sheet hedging income will completely offset the change in asset yields importantly the potential to retain surge deposits with lower than expected repricing behavior represents an opportunity for further net interest income growth in the increasing rate scenario net interest income remains exposed to intermediate yield curve tenors while this was a headwind to net interest income during the pandemic it also represents a tailwind to net interest income growth as the yield curve steepens an increase in intermediate and longterm interest rates such as intermediate to longerterm us treasuries swap and mortgage rates will drive yields higher on certain fixed rate newly originated or renewed loans increase prospective yields on certain investment portfolio purchases and reduce amortization of premium expense on existing securities in the investment portfolio the opposite is true in an environment where intermediate and longterm interest rates fall approximately of fixed rate asset production is at the 5year tenor point or shorter the interest rate sensitivity analysis presented below in table is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve though there are many assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income those pertaining to deposit pricing deposit mix and overall balance sheet composition are particularly impactful given the uncertainties associated with the prolonged period of low interest rates and industry liquidity management evaluates the impact to its sensitivity analysis of these key assumptions sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future results the companys baseline balance sheet assumptions include managements best estimate for balance sheet growth in the coming months however the behavior of pandemicrelated surge deposits under a rising rate scenario is uncertain therefore table includes two balance sheet scenarios to help inform a potential range of outcomes the first is an opportunity scenario and assumes that these deposits behave more like stable legacy balances which is consistent with historical disclosures the second is a reduction scenario assuming that these depositors will be more sensitive to rate requiring a higher interest rate in order to hold their balances with the bank for this scenario surge deposits are assumed to encompass all balance growth on legacy accounts evidenced from february to june or approximately billion these deposits including noninterest bearing products are attributed with a repricing beta in rising rate scenarios importantly the impact to net interest income under a changing rate environment is the same whether the surge deposit balances are held at a higher beta or the balances attrite and the funding is replaced with wholesale sources given the evolving nature of the environment estimates have been conservatively derived should the balances remain with the company longer or demonstrate less sensitivity to interest rates there is potential for upside eg the opportunity scenario the disclosure in table does not prescribe a view as to the longevity of surge deposits on the balance sheet the behavior of deposit pricing in response to changes in interest rate levels is largely informed by analyses of prior rate cycles in the base case scenario and falling rate scenarios in table interestbearing deposit rates move into the single digits the deposit beta model is dynamic across both interest rate level and time currently the scenario one gradual basis point shock outlined in the table below includes an approximate to interestbearing deposit beta for legacy deposits again the surge deposit interestbearing deposit beta is bookended in each scenario assuming legacy betas and a beta respectively deposit pricing outperformance or underperformance of in that scenario would increase or decrease net interest income by approximately million respectively in rising rate scenarios only management assumes that the mix of legacy deposits will change versus the base case as informed by analyses of prior rate cycles management assumes that in rising rate scenarios some shift from noninterest bearing to interestbearing products will occur the magnitude of the shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately billion over months in the gradual basis point scenario in table the table below summarizes regions positioning in various parallel yield curve shifts ie including all yield curve tenors the scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate hedging activities more information regarding hedges is disclosed in table and its accompanying description importantly outstanding receivefixed cash flow hedges begin to mature in december while those maturities are outside of the 12month horizon of the analysis outlined in table the hedge maturity profile will begin to add asset sensitivity at a time when markets currently expect the fomc to begin to increase shortterm interest rates regions expects to maintain a persistent amount of hedges through time to support a consistent sustainable earnings profile and will adjust outstanding derivatives depending on changing market dynamics and the balance sheet mix table 21interest rate sensitivity scenario one estimated annual change in net interest income june scenario two estimated annual change in net interest income june in millions gradual change in interest rates basis points basis points basis points floored instantaneous change in interest rates basis points basis points basis points floored disclosed interest rate sensitivity levels represent the 12month forward looking net interest income changes as compared to market forward rate cases and include expected balance sheet growth and remixing all cash flow hedges are fully reflected within the measurement horizon see table for additional information regarding hedge maturity dates scenario assumes all deposits including surge deposits perform consistently with historical experiences scenario accounts for uncertainty in surge deposit balances assumes a beta on surge balances calculated as legacy deposit growth experienced since february billion as of june the basis point floored scenario represents a rate shock where all rates are floored at historical lows observed during the pandemic regions has established scenarios by which yield curve tenors will fall to a consistent level the shock magnitude for each tenor when compared to market forward rates equates to the lesser of the shock scenario amount or a rate equal to the historical alltime minimum further the scenarios presented do not allow for negative rates the falling rate scenarios in table above quantify the expected impact for both gradual and instantaneous shocks under this environment interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of regions securities portfolio which can directly impact the carrying value of shareholders equity regions from time to time may hedge these price movements with derivatives as discussed below derivatives regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity alco which consists of members of regions senior management team in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with customer derivatives which include interest rate credit and foreign exchange risks the most common derivatives regions employs are forward rate contracts eurodollar futures contracts interest rate swaps options on interest rate swaps interest rate caps and floors and forward sale commitments forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield a eurodollar futures contract is a future on a eurodollar deposit eurodollar futures contracts subject regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable rate or vice versa streams of interest payments the notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreedupon price foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate these contracts are executed on behalf of the companys customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform regions has made use of interest rate swaps and floors in balance sheet hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixedrate funding position to a variablerate position and to effectively convert a portion of its variablerate loan portfolios to fixedrate regions also uses derivatives to economically manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business in the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this heldforsale portfolio futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing

contracts reference a combination of shortterm libor benchmarks primarily 1month libor as of june all of the cash flow hedging relationships designated in table above were active total cash flow hedges have a current weighted average maturity of approximately years during the first and second quarters of regions shortened a portion of its future hedge exposure to balance its future interest rate risk needs with the evolving macroeconomic environment and its changing balance sheet during the first and second quarters of the company terminated billion and million respectively in notional of floor hedges during the first and second quarters of the company terminated billion and billion respectively in notional of swap hedges notional of billion and billion was replaced with shorter maturity swaps during the first and second quarters of respectively longer maturity receivefixed swap terminations of billion in the second quarter of were intended to offset some of the sensitivity impact from adding billion fixedrate securities during the second quarter importantly the gain on unwound hedges is deferred and amortized into net interest income over the life of the original hedge creating no change in the expected net interest income profile relative to the discounted future cash flows under market forward rates at the time the hedges are unwound these changes and the resulting hedge maturity profile allow for an increasing asset sensitive balance sheet position when the fomc seems more likely to move shortterm rates higher further the industry transition away from libor rates is not expected to materially impact either hedge effectiveness or income recognition on the companys current portfolio of hedges the following table presents cash flow hedge notional

regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions for nondealer transactions the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements when there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from andor posted to that counterparty all hedging interest rate swap derivatives traded by regions are subject to mandatory clearing the counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the clearinghouse allowing regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse the credit risk section in regions annual report on form 10k for the year ended december contains more information on the management of credit risk regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers interest rate swaps interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives

cloud and other emerging technologies and the increasing sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external parties or fraud on the part of employees as a result of the covid19 pandemic regions has experienced a modest increase in cyber events such as phishing attacks and malicious traffic from outside the united states however the companys layered control environment has effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these events even when regions successfully prevents cyber attacks to its own network the company may still incur losses that result from customers account information being obtained through breaches of retailers networks that enable customer transactions the fraud losses as well as the costs of investigations and reissuing new customer cards may impact regions financial results in addition regions also relies on some vendors to provide certain business infrastructure components and although regions actively assesses and monitors the information security capabilities of these vendors regions reliance on them may also increase exposure to information security risk in the event of
