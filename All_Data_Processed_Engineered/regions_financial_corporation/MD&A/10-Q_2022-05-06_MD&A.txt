higher net interest income for the first quarter of net interest income taxableequivalent basis totaled billion up million compared to the first quarter of the net interest margin taxableequivalent basis was percent for the first quarter of and percent in the first quarter of the increase in net interest income was primarily driven by increases in average loan balances and average debt securities balances as well as lower funding costs net interest margin was negatively impacted by continued elevated liquidity as evidenced by higher average cash balances held at the federal reserve refer to table consolidated average daily balances and yieldrate analysis for further details the benefit for credit losses totaled million in the first quarter of as compared to a benefit of million

general imprecision component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are inherent in any modeling estimate the march general imprecision allowance remained relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter of and reflects uncertainty in the current environment including the risk of persistent inflation at elevated levels geopolitical tension impacts and supply chain issues based on the overall analysis performed management deemed an allowance of billion to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan and credit commitment portfolios as of march details

related federal tax benefit net interest income is regions principal source of income and is one of the most important elements of regions ability to meet its overall performance goals both net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by market interest rates and in the first quarter of the fomc increased the fed funds rate by basis points with additional rate increases expected in net interest income taxableequivalent basis increased for the first three months of compared to the same period in the increase in net interest income was driven primarily by average loan growth and rising interest rates also contributing to the increase was slightly higher hedgerelated income lower funding costs and a larger securities portfolio these increases were partially offset by a decline in ppp forgiveness income when compared to first quarter of net interest margin was equal to percent and percent for the first three months of and respectively the decline was primarily driven by continued elevated liquidity as indicated by higher cash balances see the first quarter overview section for the companys expectations for interest income as a component of total revenue see also the market riskinterest rate risk section below for additional information market riskinterest rate risk regions primary market risk is interest rate risk this includes uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest rate levels which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the company offers to quantify this risk regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful shortterm indicator of regions interest rate risk sensitivity measurementfinancial simulation models are regions primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of regions balance sheet assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic plans and from customer behavior among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business interest raterelated risks are expressly considered such as pricing spreads the pricing of deposit accounts prepayments and other option risks regions considers these factors as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior the primary objective of assetliability management at regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles in computing interest rate sensitivity for measurement regions compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates the standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus and basis points given low market rates by historical standards the company focuses on a falling rate shock scenario where all rates fall to levels consistent with historical 12month average rate minimums in addition to parallel curve shifts multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are contemplated regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements phased in over a sixmonth period that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements exposure to interest rate movementsas of march regions was asset sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as compared to the base case for the 12month measurement horizon ending march the first quarter of continued the trend of balance sheet growth in lowcost deposits observed throughout retention of these balance sheet liquidity inflows is uncertain and some amount of the recent deposit growth may be more rate sensitive under a rising rate scenario therefore additional sensitivity analysis focused on pandemicrelated surge deposit pricing behavior and retention is outlined in table the estimated exposure associated with the rising and falling rate scenarios in the table below reflects the combined impacts of movements in shortterm and longterm interest rates currently net interest income is projected to benefit from rising shortterm interest rates ie asset sensitive profile an increase or reduction in shortterm interest rates such as the fed funds rate the rate of interest on excess reserves 1month libor sofr and bsby will drive the yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such rates higher or lower under either environment it is expected that changes in funding costs and balance sheet hedging income will only somewhat offset the change in asset yields importantly the potential to retain surge deposits with lower than expected repricing behavior represents an opportunity for further net interest income growth in the increasing rate scenario as well net interest income remains exposed to intermediate yield curve tenors while this was a headwind to net interest income during the pandemic it represents a tailwind to net interest income growth as the yield curve rises an increase in intermediate and longterm interest rates such as intermediate to longerterm us treasuries swap and mortgage rates will drive yields higher on certain fixed rate newly originated or renewed loans increase prospective yields on certain investment portfolio purchases and reduce amortization of premium expense on existing securities in the investment portfolio the opposite is true in an environment where intermediate and longterm interest rates fall approximately percent of fixed rate asset production is at the 5year tenor point or shorter the interest rate sensitivity analysis presented below in table is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve though there are many assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income those pertaining to deposit pricing deposit mix and overall balance sheet composition are particularly impactful given the uncertainties associated with the prolonged period of low interest rates and industry liquidity management evaluates the impact to its sensitivity analysis of these key assumptions sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future results the companys baseline balance sheet assumptions include managements best estimate for balance sheet growth in the coming months however the behavior of pandemicrelated surge deposits under a rising rate scenario is uncertain since yearend the last periodend free from the effects of covid19 deposit balances have increased by approximately billion exclusive of deposits acquired in the enerbank acquisition and approximately billion of the increase was determined to be attributable to pandemicrelated surge deposits therefore table includes two balance sheet scenarios to help inform a potential range of outcomes the first is an opportunity scenario and assumes that these deposits behave more like stable legacy balances which is consistent with historical disclosures the second scenario assumes that these depositors will be more sensitive to rate requiring a higher interest rate in order to hold their balances with the bank these deposits including noninterest bearing products are attributed with an approximate percent repricing beta in rising rate scenarios importantly the impact to net interest income under a changing rate environment is the same whether the surge deposit balances are held at a higher beta or the balances attrite and the funding is replaced with wholesale sources given the evolving nature of the environment estimates have been conservatively derived should the balances remain with the company longer or demonstrate less sensitivity to interest rates there is potential for upside eg the opportunity scenario the disclosure in table does not prescribe a view as to the longevity of surge deposits on the balance sheet the behavior of deposit pricing in response to changes in interest rate levels is largely informed by analyses of prior rate cycles in the base case scenario in table interestbearing deposits reprice using an approximately percent beta the deposit beta model is dynamic across both interest rate level and time currently the scenario one gradual basis point shock outlined in the table below includes an approximate percent to percent interestbearing deposit beta for legacy deposits again the surge deposit interestbearing deposit beta is bookended in each scenario assuming legacy betas and a percent beta respectively deposit pricing outperformance or underperformance of percent in that scenario would increase or decrease net interest income by approximately million respectively in rising rate scenarios only management assumes that the mix of legacy deposits will change versus the base case as informed by analyses of prior rate cycles management assumes that in rising rate scenarios some shift from noninterest bearing to interestbearing products will occur the magnitude of the shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately billion over months in the gradual basis point scenario in table the table below summarizes regions positioning over the next months in various parallel yield curve shifts ie including all yield curve tenors the scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate hedging activities

table for additional information regarding hedge start and maturity dates scenario one assumes all deposits including surge deposits perform consistently with historical experiences scenario two accounts for uncertainty in surge deposit balances assumes an approximate beta on surge balances approximately billion projected surge deposit balance the basis point floored scenario represents a rate shock where all rates are floored at 12month average historical lows regions has established scenarios by which yield curve tenors will fall to a consistent level the shock magnitude for each tenor when compared to market forward rates equates to the lesser of the shock scenario amount or a rate equal to the historical 12month average minimum for example the 10year treasury yield falls to basis points the falling rate scenarios in table above quantify the expected impact for both gradual and instantaneous shocks under this environment interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of regions securities portfolio which can directly impact the carrying value of shareholders equity regions comprehensive interest rate risk management approach uses derivatives and debt

during first quarter of derivatives regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity alco which consists of members of regions senior management team in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with customer derivatives which include interest rate credit and foreign exchange risks the most common derivatives regions employs are forward rate contracts eurodollar futures contracts interest rate swaps options on interest rate swaps interest rate caps and floors and forward sale commitments forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield a eurodollar futures contract is a future on a eurodollar deposit eurodollar futures contracts subject regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates because futures contracts are cash settled daily there is minimal credit risk associated with eurodollar futures interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable or vice versa streams of interest payments the notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreedupon price foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate these contracts are executed on behalf of the companys customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform regions has made use of interest rate swaps and floors in balance sheet hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixedrate funding position to a variablerate position to effectively convert a portion of its

establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions for nondealer transactions the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements when there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from andor posted to that counterparty most hedging interest rate swap derivatives traded by regions are subject to mandatory clearing the counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively

to compromise or disable information systems such attempts have increased in recent years and the trend is expected to continue for a number of reasons including increases in technologybased products and services used by us and our customers the growing use of mobile cloud and other emerging technologies and the increasing sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external parties or fraud on the part of employees as a result of the covid19 pandemic regions has experienced a modest increase in cyber events such as phishing attempts and malicious traffic from outside the us however the companys layered control environment has effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these events even when regions successfully prevents cyber attacks to its own network the company may still incur losses that result from customers account information being obtained through breaches of retailers networks that enable customer transactions the related fraud losses as well as the costs of reissuing new cards may impact regions financial results in addition regions also relies on some vendors to provide certain business infrastructure components and although regions actively assesses and monitors the information security capabilities of these vendors regions reliance on them may also increase exposure to information security risk in the event of a cyber attack or other data breach regions may be required to incur significant expenses including with respect to remediation costs costs of
