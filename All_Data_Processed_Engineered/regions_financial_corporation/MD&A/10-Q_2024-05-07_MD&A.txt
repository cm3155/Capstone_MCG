taxableequivalent net interest income is based on the statutory federal income tax rate of adjusted for applicable state income taxes net of the related federal tax benefit net interest income is regions principal source of income and is one of the most important elements of regions ability to meet its overall performance goals both net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by market interest rates and although interest rates are expected to decline in longterm and shortterm interest rates remain higher as compared to the first quarter of net interest income taxableequivalent basis decreased by million and net interest margin decreased by basis points to percent in the first quarter of compared to the same period in these decreases were driven primarily by increases in deposit and funding costs due to remixing partially offsetting the increase in funding cost is higher asset yields benefiting from the maturity and replacement of loweryielding fixed rate loans and securities market riskinterest rate risk regions primary market risk is interest rate risk this includes uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest rate levels which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the company offers as its primary tool to analyze this risk regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful shortterm indicator of regions interest rate risk in addition to net interest income simulations regions also utilizes an eve analysis as a measurement tool to estimate risk exposure over a longerterm horizon eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets liabilities and derivative instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates importantly eve values only the current balance sheet excluding the growth assumptions used in net interest income sensitivity analyses additionally the results are highly dependent on imprecise assumptions for products with embedded prepay optionality and indeterminate maturities the uncertainty surrounding important assumptions used in eve analysis may limit its efficacy sensitivity measurementfinancial simulation models are regions primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of regions balance sheet assumptions are made about the direction and magnitude of interest rate movements the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic plans and customer behavior among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business interest raterelated risks are expressly considered such as pricing spreads the pricing of deposit accounts prepayments and other option risks regions considers these factors as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior the primary objective of assetliability management at regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles in computing interest rate sensitivity regions compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates see the first quarter overview section for details on expectations for net interest income in the set of alternative interest rate scenarios includes instantaneous parallel rate shifts of various magnitudes in addition to parallel rate shifts multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are contemplated regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements phased in over a sixmonth period that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements exposure to interest rate movementsregions balance sheet is naturally asset sensitive with net interest income increasing with higher interest rates and decreasing with lower interest rates this is the result of approximately half of the loan portfolio floating contractually with market rate indices and funding from a large mostly stable retail deposit portfolio importantly the stability and rate sensitivity of regions deposit portfolio has been proven over multiple interest rate cycles with this natural balance sheet profile the ability to utilize discretionary asset duration strategies within the investment portfolio and through derivative hedges is critical in mitigating the banks naturally asset sensitive position as of march regions evidenced a mostly balanced or neutral assetliability position with an asset duration of approximately years and a liability duration of approximately years using historicallyinformed approximations the securities portfolio duration was approximately years and is appropriate for regions risk profile in order to offset the longduration deposit liabilities while the derivative hedging portfolio is recorded on the balance sheet including current unrealized losses deposit value increases have more than offset these losses through the rising rate environment the additional value of deposits in a higher rate environment is realized in the form of lowercost funding when compared with wholesale sources while balance sheet analysis particularly eve analysis does contemplate the economic value of deposits the estimated fair value of deposits is equal to their carrying value for certain financial statement footnote disclosures consistent with industry practices see note fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements for additional information as of march regions net interest income profile was mostly neutral to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as compared to the base case for the 12month measurement horizon ending march the estimated exposure associated with the rising and falling rate scenarios in table below reflects the combined impacts of movements in shortterm and longterm interest rates an increase or reduction in shortterm interest rates such as the fed funds rate the rate of interest on excess reserves and sofr will drive the yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such rates higher or lower in either scenario it is expected that changes in funding costs and balance sheet hedging income will offset the change in asset yields resulting in little change to net interest income net interest income remains exposed to intermediate and longterm yield curve tenors while this was a headwind to net interest income during a low rate environment it represents a tailwind to net interest income growth as the yield curve rises and remains elevated elevated or increasing intermediate and longterm interest rates such as intermediate to longerterm us treasuries swaps and mortgage rates will drive yields higher on certain fixedrate newly originated or renewed loans increase prospective yields on certain investment portfolio purchases and reduce amortization of premium expense on existing securities in the investment portfolio the opposite is true in an environment where intermediate and longterm interest rates fall the interest rate sensitivity analysis presented below in table is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve though there are many assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income those pertaining to deposit pricing deposit mix and overall balance sheet composition are particularly impactful given the uncertainties associated with monetary policy on industry liquidity levels and the cost of that liquidity management evaluates the impacts from these key assumptions through sensitivity analysis sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be considered predictive of future results the companys baseline balance sheet assumptions include managements best estimate for balance sheet changes in the coming months in the first quarter of regions experienced a slight increase in deposits due to seasonality the baseline scenario projects deposit balances to decline modestly over the forecast horizon additional deposit balance outflow of billion would reduce net interest income by million over months in the parallel instantaneous basis point scenario in table conversely if an additional billion are retained a positive benefit of million would be expected over months in the parallel instantaneous basis point scenario table in rising rate scenarios only management assumes that the mix of deposits will further change versus the base case as informed by analyses of prior rate cycles currently however much of the anticipated mix shift has already occurred or is expected to occur within the baseline scenario mitigating the amount of additional remixing in higher rate scenarios the magnitude of the remixing shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately billion over months in the parallel instantaneous basis point scenario in table furthermore over the month horizon an increase of billion in deposit remixing would decrease net interest income by approximately million and a decrease of billion in deposit remixing would increase net interest income by million in the parallel instantaneous basis point scenario the interestbearing deposit beta is calibrated using the experience from prior rate cycles and is dynamic across both interest rate level and time the base case scenario anticipates a peak in deposit rates by midyear the parallel instantaneous basis point shock scenario in table incorporates an incremental beta between and percent when compared to the base case scenario while the parallel instantaneous basis point shock scenario incorporates an incremental beta between and percent when compared to the base case scenario incremental deposit pricing outperformance or underperformance of percent in a parallel instantaneous basis point shock would increase or decrease net interest income by approximately million the table below summarizes regions positioning over the next months in various parallel yield curve shifts ie including all yield curve tenors the scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate hedging activities more information regarding hedges is disclosed in table and its accompanying

carrying value of shareholders equity derivatives regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity alco which consists of members of regions senior management team in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with customer derivatives which include interest rate credit and foreign exchange risks the most common derivatives regions employs are forward rate contracts forward sale commitments futures contracts interest rate swaps interest rate options caps floors and collars and contracts with a combination of these instruments forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield futures contracts subject regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates because futures contracts are cash settled daily there is minimal credit risk associated with futures interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable or vice versa streams of interest payments the notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreedupon price foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate these contracts are executed on behalf of the companys customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform regions has made use of interest rate swaps and options in balance sheet hedging strategies

it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions for nondealer transactions the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements when there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from andor posted to that counterparty most hedging interest rate swap derivatives traded by regions are subject to mandatory clearing the counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the clearinghouse allowing regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse the credit risk section in this report contains more information on the management of credit risk regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers interest rate swaps
