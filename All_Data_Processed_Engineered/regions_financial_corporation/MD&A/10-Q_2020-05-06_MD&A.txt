item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis is part of regions financial corporations regions or the company quarterly report on s health pandemics government stimulus and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts floods and hurricanes management considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the allowance these variables and others have the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts since january regions increased the allowance by million to billion which represents managements best estimate of expected losses over the life of the loan and credit commitment portfolios key drivers of the change in the allowance for credit losses are presented below table allowance changes three months ended march in millions allowance for credit losses at january as adjusted for change in accounting guidance economic uncertainty and specific model adjustments increase in specific allowances model parametersother adjustments consumer portfolio segment balance runoff total changes allowance for credit losses at march regions adopted the cecl accounting guidance on january and recorded the cumulative effect of the change in accounting guidance as a reduction to retained earnings and an increase to deferred tax assets see note for additional details changes in the macroeconomic environment can be extremely impactful to the allowance estimate under cecl when compared to january which was based on a benign economic environment regions economic forecast utilized in the march allowance models had deteriorated as a result of the covid19 pandemic regions benchmarked its internal forecast with external forecasts and external data available while various data points and alternative viewpoints were considered the risks to the economic forecast utilized in the allowance were weighted to the downside through the qualitative framework given the high degree of uncertainty around how widely the covid19 pandemic could spread and how long it could persist the effectiveness of government relief programs and debt payment relief being provided by the company as well as the potential for any future stimulus was also considered which the company believes could be significant mitigating factors regions quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors however any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of imprecision the qualitative framework has a general imprecision component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are inherent in any modeling estimate given that credit deterioration from covid19 had not fully materialized at march and that the models are not calibrated for such a pandemic the impact of covid19 on the allowance was primarily captured through the economic uncertainty component of the qualitative framework as part of the qualitative framework regions ran an updatedmore severe forecast through the allowance models for sensitivity purposes the updatedmore severe forecast reflects an abrupt halt to the economy management also benchmarked the updatedmore severe forecast to external forecasts noting overall alignment and comparability of results the tables below reflect a range of macroeconomic factors utilized in the base utilized in the allowance models and updatedmore severe utilized in the qualitative framework forecasts over the rs forecast period with unemployment being the most significant macroeconomic factor among the cecl models first quarter forecast information is also included table macroeconomic factors in the forecast prers period base rs

includes additional qualitative amounts in addition to the modeled base forecast to capture economic uncertainties as such the base forecast factors listed in the table above do not specifically align with regions allowance there were several points of analysis used to inform an appropriate qualitative overlay for economic uncertainty in addition to running the updatedmore severe forecast industrylevel stress analyses were also performed on industries most acutely impacted by covid19 refer to the portfolio characteristics section for more information about covid19 impacted industries the overall range from these collective alternative analyses resulted in potential increases of approximately million to million as compared to the january allowance these analyticallyderived ranges however are not able to fully take into consideration the specifics of the cares act and other policy accommodations which could materially impact loss expectations based on the overall analysis performed management deemed an increase in the allowance of million as compared to january to be appropriate to absorb expected credit losses in the loan and credit commitment portfolios as of march subsequent to march additional economic forecasts indicated continued rapid deterioration in certain macroeconomic factors primarily real gdp and unemployment rates the level of uncertainty related to how these forecasts will impact expected credit losses and future credit loss provisions remains high due to uncertainty concerning the length and depth of the covid19 pandemic and related shelter in place orders as well as the offsetting impacts of current and future government stimulus and lending programs due to the unprecedented nature of the uncertainties discussed above an estimate of the expected increase in the allowance cannot be made at this time however if the current trends continue it is likely that increases in the allowance which could be material will be required in future periods as a point of reference in the federal reserve disclosed their estimation of modeled credit losses for regions as part of dfast this included two scenarios an adverse and a severely adverse economic environment modeled losses in the scenarios were billion in the adverse and billion in the severely adverse scenarios whereas these stress tests assumed a different macroeconomic outlook they may represent a possible range of potential credit losses assuming a longerterm widespread pandemic with no offsetting benefits from government stimulus or lending programs which as noted above the company believes could be significant mitigating factors see the first quarter overview section for further information regarding the companys economic outlook as the second quarter of began to unfold as noted above changes in the factors used by management to determine the appropriateness of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance to be increased or decreased in future periods in addition bank regulatory agencies as part of their examination process may require changes in the level of allowance based on their judgments and estimates volatility in certain credit metrics is to be expected additionally changes in circumstances related to individually large credits commodity prices or certain macroeconomic forecast assumptions may result in volatility the scenarios discussed above or other scenarios have the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ perhaps materially from the originally estimated amounts in addition it is difficult to predict how changes in economic conditions the impact of government stimulus or other relief programs could affect borrower behavior this analysis is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect uncertainty and imprecision based on thencurrent circumstances and conditions details regarding the allowance and net chargeoffs including an analysis of activity from the previous years totals are included in table allowance for credit losses as noted above economic trends such as interest rates unemployment volatility in commodity prices and collateral valuations as well as the length and depth of the covid19 pandemic and the impact of the cares act and other policy accommodations will impact the future levels of net chargeoffs and may result in volatility of certain credit metrics during the remainder of table 8allowance for credit losses three months ended

nonperforming loans at march have increased compared to yearend levels primarily driven by energy credits that have experienced stress due to recent declines in oil prices economic trends such as interest rates unemployment volatility in commodity prices and collateral valuations will impact the future level of nonperforming assets circumstances related to individually large credits could also result in volatility at march regions estimates that the amount of commercial and investor real estate loans that have the potential to migrate to nonaccrual status in the next quarter is within the range of million to million in order to arrive at the estimated range of potential problem loans for the next quarter credit personnel forecast certain larger dollar loans that may potentially be downgraded to nonaccrual at a future time depending upon the occurrence of future events a variety of factors are included in the assessment of potential problem loans including a borrowers capacity and willingness to meet contractual repayment terms make principal curtailments or provide additional collateral when necessary and provide current and complete financial information including global cash flows contingent liabilities and sources of liquidity for other loans for example smaller dollar loans a trend analysis is also incorporated to determine an estimate of potential future downgrades in addition the economic environment and industry trends are evaluated in the establishment of the estimated range of potential problem loans for the next quarter current trends will additionally influence the size of the estimated range because of the inherent uncertainty in forecasting future events the estimated range of potential problem loans ultimately represents the estimated aggregate dollar amounts of loans as opposed to an individual listing of loans many of the loans on which the potential problem loan estimate is based are considered criticized and classified detailed disclosures for substandard accrual loans as well as other credit quality metrics are included in note loans and the allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial

and december and is allocated to each of regions reportable segments each a reporting unit at which level goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more often if events and circumstances indicate the fair value of the reporting unit may have declined below the carrying value refer to note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in the annual report on of this form 10q that could potentially indicate goodwill impairment including analyzing the impacts from the onset of the covid19 pandemic the indicators assessed included recent operating performance changes in market capitalization regulatory actions and assessments changes in the business climate including legislation legal factors competition and impacts from covid19 companyspecific factors including changes in key personnel asset impairments and business dispositions and trends in the banking industry after assessing the indicators noted above regions determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units corporate bank consumer bank and wealth management had declined below their carrying value as of march therefore regions determined that a test of goodwill impairment was not required for each of regions reporting units for the march interim period regions will continue to monitor for indicators of impairment throughout deposits regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a share of the deposit market regions ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the company meets customers needs regions employs various means to meet those needs and enhance competitiveness such as providing a high level of customer service competitive pricing and convenient branch locations for its customers regions also serves customers through providing centralized highquality banking services and alternative product delivery channels such as mobile and internet banking the following table summarizes deposits by category table 14deposits march december in millions noninterestbearing demand savings interestbearing transaction money marketdomestic time deposits customer deposits corporate treasury time deposits corporate treasury other deposits total deposits at march increased approximately billion compared to yearend levels due to increases in noninterestbearing demand domestic money market and savings accounts these increases were offset by decreases in corporate treasury other deposits and customer time deposits noninterestbearing demand deposits increased as customers reacted to the uncertainly in the economic environment driven by the covid19 pandemic by increasing line of credit draws and keeping excess cash in deposit accounts domestic money market and savings accounts also increased as customers seek the safety of a regulated and insured financial institution in times of economic uncertainty corporate treasury other deposits decreased as these deposits were used to supplement incremental balance sheet funding at yearend but were no longer being utilized at the end of the first quarter of shortterm borrowings shortterm borrowings which consist of fhlb advances totaled billion at march as compared to billion at december the levels of these borrowings can fluctuate depending on the companys funding needs and the sources utilized fhlb borrowings increased from december to march as additional fhlb advances were used to increase cash held at the frb in response to the current economic environment shortterm secured borrowings such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase and fhlb advances are a core portion of regions funding strategy the securities financing market and specifically shortterm fhlb advances continue to provide reliable funding at attractive rates see the liquidity section for further detail of regions borrowing capacity with the fhlb

weightedaverage interest rate of percent at march and percent at december with remaining maturities ranging from less than one year to eight years and a weightedaverage of approximately year shareholders equity shareholders equity was billion at march as compared to billion at december during the first three months of net income increased shareholders equity by million while cash dividends on common stock reduced shareholders equity by million and cash dividends on preferred stock reduced shareholders equity by million the cumulative effect from the adoption of cecl decreased shareholders equity by million see note basis of presentation for information about the cecl adoption changes in accumulated other comprehensive income increased shareholders equity by billion primarily due to the net change in unrealized gains losses on securities available for sale and derivative instruments as a result of changes in market interest rates during the first quarter during the second quarter of the board authorized the repurchase of up to billion of the companys common stock permitting repurchases from the beginning of the third quarter of through the end of the second quarter of the company did not repurchase shares in the first quarter of and given the uncertainty in the overall economic environment as a result of the covid19 pandemic no share repurchases are currently anticipated for regions dividend policy is set to withstand adverse conditions and as such the company currently has no plans to reduce the level of or eliminate cash dividends in consideration of the covid19 pandemic however regions will continue to exercise prudent capital management and closely monitor the implications from the evolving economic environment under us capital rules the company would be subject to constraints on dividend payout restrictions if it failed to meet the effective minimum ratio requirements which are comprised of regulatory minimum capital levels of cet1 to riskweighted assets tier capital to riskweighted assets and total riskbased capital to riskweighted assets plus a static capital conservation buffer as such effective minimum requirements are currently cet1 capital to riskweighted assets tier capital to riskweighted assets and total riskbased capital to riskweighted assets in the first quarter of the federal reserve finalized the stress capital buffer framework that will replace the capital conservation buffer when implemented in october see regulatory requirements section for further information see note stockholders equity and accumulated other comprehensive income loss for additional information regulatory requirements regions and regions bank are required to comply with regulatory capital requirements established by federal and state banking agencies these regulatory capital requirements involve quantitative measures of the companys assets liabilities and selected offbalance sheet items and also qualitative judgments by the regulators failure to meet minimum capital requirements can subject the company to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions under the basel iii rules regions is designated as a standardized approach bank additional discussion of the basel iii rules their applicability to regions recent proposals and final rules issued by the federal banking agencies and recent laws enacted that impact regulatory requirements is included in the regulatory requirements section of managements discussion and analysis in the annual report on form 10k additional discussion is also included in note regulatory capital requirements and restrictions to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report on form 10k in late march the federal banking agencies published an interim final rule related to revised transition of the impact of cecl on regulatory capital requirements the rule allows an addback to regulatory capital for the impacts of cecl for a twoyear period at the end of the two years the impact is then phasedin over the following three years the addback is calculated as the impact of initial adoption adjusted for percent of subsequent changes in the allowance at march this amount was approximately million the impact on cet1 was approximately basis points the interim final rule has been published for comment and has an immediate effective date additionally in late march the cares act was signed into law this act provides optional temporary relief from complying with cecl while regions is deferring the capital impact of cecl allowed by the interim final rule as discussed above the company did not elect the statutory relief related to cecl implementation provided by the cares act the following table summarizes the applicable holding

highquality liquid assets under an acute 30day liquidity stress scenario under the tailoring rules regions has been designated as a category iv institution and is no longer subject to any lcr requirement category iv institutions including regions remain subject to liquidity risk management requirements but these requirements are now tailored such that collateral positions are calculated only monthly a more limited set of liquidity risk limits exists and fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures are monitored also liquidity stress testing is required quarterly rather than monthly and liquidity data on the fr is reported on a monthly basis regions remains subject to the liquidity buffer requirements regions maintains a robust liquidity management framework designed to effectively manage liquidity risk in accordance with sound risk management principals the framework establishes sustainable processes and tools to effectively identify measure mitigate monitor and report liquidity risks beginning with regions liquidity management policy and the liquidity risk appetite statements approved by the board processes within the liquidity management framework include

and related ratios regions believes that expressing earnings and certain other financial measures excluding these significant items provides a meaningful base for periodtoperiod comparisons which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the company and predicting future performance these nongaap financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of regions business because management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations regions believes that presentation of these nongaap financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the company on the same basis as that applied by management management and the board utilize these nongaap financial measures as follows preparation of regions operating budgets monthly financial performance reporting monthly closeout reporting of consolidated results management only presentations to investors of

average and ending total loans provides a meaningful calculation of loan growth rates and presents them on the same basis as that applied by management the adjusted efficiency ratio nongaap which is a measure of productivity is generally calculated as adjusted noninterest expense divided by adjusted total revenue on a taxableequivalent basis the adjusted fee income ratio nongaap is generally

analyzing the capital position of the company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock traditionally the federal reserve and other banking regulatory bodies have assessed a banks capital adequacy based on cet1 the calculation of which is codified in federal banking regulations analysts and banking regulators have assessed regions capital adequacy using the tangible common shareholders equity measure because tangible common shareholders equity is not formally defined by gaap this measure is considered to be a nongaap financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently than regions disclosed calculations since analysts and banking regulators may assess regions capital adequacy using tangible common shareholders equity regions believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess regions capital adequacy on this same basis nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited although these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a

interest rate exposure using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of regions balance sheet assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic plans and from customer behavior among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business interest raterelated risks are expressly considered such as pricing spreads the pricing of deposit accounts prepayments and other option risks regions considers these factors as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior the primary objective of assetliability management at regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles in computing interest rate sensitivity for measurement regions compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates the standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus and basis points given low market rates by historical standards the company focuses on a falling rate shock scenario with most yield curve tenors floored near zero and a reduction in mortgage indices based on historical minimums as explained in the following section in addition to parallel curve shifts multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are contemplated regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements phased in over a sixmonth period that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements exposure to interest rate movements as of march regions was modestly asset sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as compared to the base case for the measurement horizon ending march the estimated exposure associated with falling rate scenarios in the table below reflects the combined impacts of movements in shortterm and longterm interest rates the decline in shortterm interest rates such as the fed funds rate the rate of interest on excess reserves and month libor will lead to a reduction of yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such rates deposit and other funding costs are currently low when compared to historical levels therefore it is expected that declines in funding costs will only partially offset the decline in asset yields yet the combination of deposit cost reductions and increased balance sheet hedging income serves to mostly offset net interest income sensitivity to shortterm rates net interest income remains exposed to longer yield curve tenors a reduction in intermediate and longterm interest rates such as intermediate to longerterm us treasuries swap and mortgage rates will drive yields lower on certain fixed rate newly originated or renewed loans reduce prospective yields on certain investment portfolio purchases and increase amortization of premium expense on existing securities in the investment portfolio the table below summarizes regions positioning in various parallel yield curve shifts ie including all yield curve tenors the scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate risk hedging activities forward starting hedges that have been transacted are contemplated to the extent they start within the measurement horizon twelvemonth horizon asset sensitivity levels are expected to continue to decline through as forward starting hedges move completely into the measurement window more information regarding forward starting hedges is disclosed in table and its accompanying description table 20interest rate sensitivity estimated annual change in net interest income march in millions gradual change in interest rates basis points basis points basis points floored instantaneous change in interest rates basis points basis points basis points floored disclosed interest rate sensitivity levels represent the month forward looking net interest income changes as compared to market forward rate cases and include expected balance sheet growth and remixing forward starting cash flow hedges already transacted will reduce sensitivity levels through as they continue to move into the measurement horizon see table for additional information regarding hedge start dates the basis point floored scenario represents a month average rate shock of basis points and basis points to zero for month libor and the year us treasury yield respectively mortgage yield shocks are floored at their historical minimums minus basis points as market interest rates increased in recent years regions had established scenarios by which yield curve tenors will fall to a consistent level the shock magnitude for each tenor when compared to market forward rates equated to the lesser of the shock scenario amount or a rate basis points lower than the historical alltime minimum recent market volatility and new historic lows established for longer yield curve tenors have resulted in a shock scenario where the majority of rates now fall to approximately zero mortgage rates which have retained somewhat elevated levels are still being shocked in the manner previously described further the scenarios presented do not allow for negative rates the falling rate scenarios in table above quantify the expected impact for both gradual and instantaneous shocks under this environment as discussed above the interest rate sensitivity analysis presented in table is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve though there are many assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income those pertaining to deposit pricing deposit mix and overall balance sheet composition are particularly impactful given the uncertainties associated with the prolonged period of low interest rates management evaluates the impact to its sensitivity analysis of these key assumptions sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future results the companys baseline balance sheet assumptions include loan and deposit growth reflecting managements best estimate the behavior of deposits in response to changes in interest rate levels is largely informed by analyses of prior rate cycles but with suitable adjustments based on managements expectations in the current rate environment in the base case scenario and falling rate scenarios in table interestbearing deposit rates achieve historical lows in rising rate scenarios only management assumes that the mix of deposits will change versus the base case balance sheet growth assumptions as informed by analyses of prior rate cycles management assumes that in rising rate scenarios some shift from noninterest bearing to interestbearing products will occur the magnitude of the shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately billion over months in the gradual basis point scenario in table while estimates should be used as a guide differences may result driven by the pace of rate changes and other market competitive factors interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of regions securities portfolio which can directly impact the carrying value of shareholders equity regions from time to time may hedge these price movements with derivatives as discussed below derivatives regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity alco which consists of members of regions senior management team in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with customer derivatives which include interest rate credit and foreign exchange risks the most common derivatives regions employs are forward rate contracts eurodollar futures contracts interest rate swaps options on interest rate swaps interest rate caps and floors and forward sale commitments forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield a eurodollar futures contract is a future on a eurodollar deposit eurodollar futures contracts subject regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates because futures contracts are cash settled daily there is minimal credit risk associated with eurodollar futures interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable or vice versa streams of interest payments the notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreedupon price foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate these contracts are executed on behalf of the companys customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform regions has made use of interest rate swaps and floors in balance sheet hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixedrate funding position to a variablerate position and to effectively convert a portion of its variablerate loan portfolios to fixedrate regions also uses derivatives to economically manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business in the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this heldforsale portfolio futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing the following table presents additional information about the hedging interest rate

risk of these instruments in much the same way as it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions for nondealer transactions the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements when there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from andor posted to that counterparty all hedging interest rate swap derivatives traded by regions are subject to mandatory clearing the counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the clearinghouse allowing regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse the credit risk section in regions annual report on form 10k for the year ended december contains more information on the management of credit risk regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers interest rate swaps interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to customers other derivative instruments with similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility associated with this portfolio instruments used to service customers are held in the

that by the end of panel banks will no longer be required to submit estimates that are used to construct libor confirming that the continuation of libor will not be guaranteed beyond that date regions holds instruments that may be impacted by the likely discontinuance of libor including loans investments hedging products floatingrate obligations and other financial instruments that use libor as a benchmark rate the company cannot currently predict the full impact of the libor discontinuation on net interest income or the related processes however regions is coordinating with regulators and industry groups to identify appropriate alternative rates for contracts expiring after and preparing for this transition as it relates to both new and existing exposures the company has established a libor transition program which includes dedicated leadership and staff with all relevant business lines and support groups engaged a libor impact and risk assessment has been performed which

impact to contracts and products evaluating necessary operational and infrastructure enhancements upon implementation of alternative benchmark rates and coordinating communications with customers market riskprepayment risk regions like most financial institutions is subject to changing prepayment speeds on mortgagerelated assets under different interest rate environments prepayment risk is a significant risk to earnings and specifically to net interest income for example mortgage loans and other financial assets may be prepaid by a debtor so that the debtor may refinance its obligations at lower rates as loans and other financial assets prepay in a falling rate environment regions must reinvest these funds in loweryielding assets prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce regions interest income and overall asset yields conversely in a rising rate environment these assets will prepay at a slower rate resulting in opportunity cost by not having the cash flow to reinvest at higher rates prepayment risk can also impact the value of securities and the carrying value of equity regions greatest exposures to prepayment risks primarily rest in its mortgagebacked securities portfolio the mortgage fixedrate loan portfolio and the residential msr all of which tend to be sensitive to interest rate movements each of these assets is also exposed to prepayment risk due to factors which are not necessarily the result of interest rates but rather due to changes in policies or programs related either directly or indirectly to the us governments governance over certain lending and financing within the mortgage market such policies can work to either encourage or discourage financing dynamics and represent a risk that is extremely difficult to forecast and may be the result of noneconomic factors the company attempts to monitor and manage such exposures within reasonable expectations while acknowledging all such risks cannot be foreseen or avoided further regions has prepayment risk that would be reflected in noninterest income in the form of servicing income on the residential msrs regions actively monitors prepayment exposure as part of its overall net interest income forecasting and interest rate risk management liquidity liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of regions and affects regions ability to meet the borrowing needs

regions goal in liquidity management is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers while at the same time meeting the companys cash flow needs in normal and stressed conditions having and using various sources of liquidity to satisfy the companys funding requirements is important in order to ensure an appropriate level of liquidity is maintained regions performs specific procedures including scenario analyses and stress testing at the bank holding company and affiliate levels regions liquidity policy requires the holding company to maintain cash sufficient to cover the greater of months of debt service and other cash needs or a minimum cash balance of million cash and cash equivalents at the holding company totaled billion at march compliance with the holding company cash requirements is reported to the risk committee of the board on a quarterly basis regions also has minimum liquidity requirements for the bank and subsidiaries these minimum requirements are informed by internal stress testing measures which are reflective of regions portfolio and business mix the banks funding and contingency planning does not currently assume any reliance on shortterm unsecured sources risk limits are established by the board through its risk appetite statement and liquidity policy the companys board lroc and alco regularly review compliance with the established limits the securities portfolio is one of regions primary sources of liquidity proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of securities provide a constant flow of funds available for cash needs see note debt securities to the consolidated financial statements the agency guaranteed mortgagebacked securities portfolio is another source of liquidity in various secured borrowing capacities maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds regions liquidity is further enhanced by its relatively stable customer deposit base liquidity needs can also be met by borrowing funds in state and national money markets although regions does not assume reliance on shortterm unsecured sources of funding the balance with the frb is the primary component of

characteristics section of the annual report on form 10k for the year ended december for a discussion of risk characteristics of each loan type information security risk regions faces a variety of operational risks including information security risks information security risks such as evolving and adaptive cyber attacks that are conducted regularly against regions and other large financial institutions to compromise or disable information systems have generally increased in recent years this trend is expected to continue for a number of reasons including the proliferation of new technologies including technologybased products and services used by us and our customers the increasing use of mobile devices and cloud technologies the ability to conduct more financial transactions online and the increasing sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external parties or fraud on the part of employees regions devotes significant financial and nonfinancial resources to identify and mitigate threats to the confidentiality availability and integrity of its information systems regions regularly assesses the threats and vulnerabilities to its environment so it can update and maintain its systems and controls to effectively mitigate these risks layered security controls are designed to complement each other to protect customer information and transactions regions regularly tests its control environment utilizing practices such as penetration testing and more targeted assessments to ensure its controls are working as expected regions will continue to commit the resources necessary to mitigate these growing cyber risks as well as continue to develop and enhance controls processes and technology to respond to evolving disruptive technology and to protect its systems from attacks or unauthorized access in addition regions maintains a strong commitment to a comprehensive risk management program that includes due diligence and oversight of thirdparty relationships with vendors as a result of the covid19 pandemic regions has experienced a modest increase in cyber events such as phishing attacks and malicious traffic from outside the united states however the companys layered control environment has effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these events regions system of internal controls also incorporates an organizationwide protocol for the appropriate reporting and escalation of information security matters to management and the board to ensure effective and efficient resolution and if necessary disclosure of any matters the board is actively engaged in the oversight of regions continuous efforts to reinforce and enhance its operational resilience and receives education to ensure that their oversight efforts accommodate for the everevolving information security threat landscape the board monitors regions information management risk policies and practices primarily through its risk committee which oversees areas of operational risk such as information technology activities risks associated with development infrastructure and cybersecurity approval and oversight of internal and thirdparty information security risk assessments strategies policies and programs and disaster recovery business continuity and incident response plans additionally the boards audit committee regularly reviews regions cybersecurity practices mainly by receiving reports on the cybersecurity management program prepared by the chief information security officer risk management and internal audit the board annually reviews the information security program and through its various committees is briefed at least quarterly on information security matters regions participates in information sharing organizations such as fsisac to gather and share information with peer banks and other financial institutions to better prepare and protect its information systems from attack fsisac is a nonprofit organization whose objective is to protect the financial services sector against cyber and physical threats and risk it acts as a trusted third party that provides anonymity to allow members to submit threat vulnerability and incident information in a nonattributable and trusted manner so information that would normally not be shared is instead made available to other members for the greater good of the membership in addition to fsisac regions is a member of bits bits serves the financial community and its members by providing industry best practices on a variety of security and fraud topics regions has contracts with vendors to provide denial of service mitigation these vendors have also committed the necessary resources to support regions in the event of a cyber event even though regions devotes significant resources to combat cyber security risks there is no guarantee that these measures will provide absolute security as an additional security measure regions has engaged a computer forensics firm and an industryleading consulting firm on retainer in case of a cyber event regions has also developed and maintains robust business continuity and disaster recovery plans that it could implement in the event of a cyber event so as to mitigate the effects of any such event and minimize necessary recovery time some of regions financial risk exposure with respect to data breaches may be offset by applicable insurance even if regions successfully prevents cyber attacks to its own network the company may still incur losses that result from customers account information being obtained through breaches of retailers networks where customers have transacted business the fraud losses as well as the costs of investigations and reissuing new customer cards may impact regions financial results in addition regions also relies on some vendors to provide certain components of its business infrastructure and although regions actively assesses and monitors the information security capabilities of these vendors regions reliance on them may also increase exposure to information security risk in the event of a cyberattack or other data breach regions may be required to incur significant expenses including with respect to remediation costs costs of implementing additional preventative measures addressing any reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil litigation arising from the event provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit losses at a level that in managements judgment is appropriate to absorb expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and
