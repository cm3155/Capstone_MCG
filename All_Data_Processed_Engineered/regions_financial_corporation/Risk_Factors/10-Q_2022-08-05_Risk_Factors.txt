adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally we provide traditional commercial retail and mortgage banking services as well as other financial services including asset management wealth management securities brokerage mergerandacquisition advisory services and other specialty financing all of our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in the south midwest and texas the principal markets in which we conduct business global economic conditions also affect our operating results because global economic conditions directly influence the us economic conditions sources of global economic and market instability include but are not limited to the potential for an economic slowdown in united kingdom europe and the united states the impact of trade negotiations economic conditions in china including the global economic impacts of the chinese economy and chinas regulation of commerce and escalating military tensions in europe as a result of russias invasion of ukraine various market conditions also affect our operating results certain changes in interest rates inflation or the financial markets could affect demand for our products a worsening of business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business could have adverse effects on our business including the following a decrease in the demand for or the availability of loans and other products and services offered by us a decrease in the value of our loans held for sale or other assets secured by consumer or commercial real estate an impairment of certain intangible assets such as goodwill a decrease in interest income from variable rate loans due to declines in interest rates and an increase in the number of clients and counterparties who become delinquent file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us which could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets net chargeoffs provisions for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale in the event of severely adverse business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business there can be no assurance that the federal government and the federal reserve would intervene further the trajectory of the covid19 pandemic including variant strains and resurgences of the covid19 virus and its effects on the us and global economy remains uncertain as does the success of any measures taken or that may be taken in response to the covid19 pandemic which ultimately may not be sufficient to address the specific effects of the pandemic or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity if economic conditions worsen or volatility increases our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected volatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation which may lead to increased costs for businesses and consumers and potentially contribute to poor business and economic conditions generally may enhance or contribute to some of the risks discussed herein for example higher inflation or volatility and uncertainty related to inflation could reduce demand for the our products adversely affect the creditworthiness of the companys borrowers or result in lower values for our investment securities and other interestearning assets in response to sustained inflationary pressures the federal reserve increased interest rates by basis points on march by basis points on may by basis points on june and by an additional basis points on july the federal reserve has also signaled its intention to continue to raise interest rates over the course of and has announced that it will begin to taper its purchases of agency mortgagebacked securities and treasury securities to the extent these policies do not mitigate the volatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation or to the extent conditions otherwise worsen we could experience adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations fluctuations in market interest rates may adversely affect our performance our profitability depends to a large extent on our net interest income which is the difference between the interest income received on interestearning assets primarily loans leases investment securities and cash balances held at the frb and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities primarily deposits and borrowings the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interestearning assets the average balance of interestbearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities these factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by external factors such as the local economy competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the fomc and interest rates markets the cost of our deposits and shortterm wholesale borrowings is largely based on marketbased liquidity and shortterm interest rates the level of which is influenced heavily by the fomcs monetary policy however the yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by both shortterm and longerterm interest rates longerterm rates are affected by multiple factors including the actions of the fomc such as quantitative easing or tightening as well as the markets expectations for future inflation growth and other economic considerations the level of net interest income is therefore influenced by the overall level of interest rates along with the shape of the yield curve interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains or create unrealized losses in our portfolios if the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interestearning assets our net interest income may decline our net interest income would be similarly affected if the interest rates on our interestearning assets declined at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities the low benchmark federal funds interest rate of the last several years implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic is ending the federal reserve increased the benchmark federal funds interest rate by basis points on march by basis points on may by basis points on june and by an additional basis points on july the federal reserve has signaled that there will be additional federal funds interest rate increases during the remainder of while an increasing rate environment would have a positive impact on net interest income increasing rates would also increase debt service requirements for some of our borrowers and may adversely affect those borrowers ability to pay as contractually obligated and could result in additional delinquencies or chargeoffs our results of operations and financial condition may also be adversely affected as a result conversely should interest rates move lower we would expect modest declines in net interest income over the next twelve months given the protection that remains in place
