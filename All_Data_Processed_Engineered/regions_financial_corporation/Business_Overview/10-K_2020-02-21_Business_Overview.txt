five other riskbased indicators crossjurisdictional activity wstwf nonbank assets offbalance sheet exposure and status as a us gsib under the tailoring rules regions and pursuant to the tailoring rules its depository institution subsidiary regions bank is subject to category iv standards which apply to banking organizations with at least billion in total consolidated assets that do not meet any of the thresholds specified for categories i through iii firms subject to category iv standards will generally be subject to the same capital and liquidity requirements as firms with less than billion in total consolidated assets but are among other things subject to certain enhanced prudential standards and also required to monitor and report certain riskbased indicators accordingly under the tailoring rules category iv firms are among other things not subject to lcr requirements or in certain cases subject to reduced requirements no longer subject to companyrun capital stress testing requirements subject to supervisory capital stress testing on a biennial instead of annual basis subject to requirements to develop and maintain a capital plan on an annual basis and subject to certain liquidity risk management and risk committee requirements a chart summarizing key elements of the capital liquidity and enhanced prudential standards requirements applicable to regions under the tailoring rules is included immediately below and elements of the tailoring rules are discussed in further detail throughout this section in addition regions and regions bank are subject to the final rule adopted by the federal reserve occ and fdic in july relating to simplifications of the capital rules applicable to nonadvanced approaches banking organizations these rules will be effective for the company on april and provide for simplified capital requirements relating to the threshold deductions for mortgage servicing assets deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that

rules do not amend the federal reserves capital plan rule but the federal reserve indicated that it expects to release a future proposal to do so to incorporate the riskbased categories in the final rules as well as to further tailor the capital planning requirements applicable to category iv firms the nsfr has not been adopted but the applicability of any finalized nsfr is expected to follow the framework for applying the lcr pursuant to the doddfrank act as amended by egrrcpa certain bhcs are required to submit resolution plans to the federal reserve and fdic providing for the companys strategy for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of its material financial distress or failure regions submitted its most recent resolution plan to these agencies in december however in connection with the release of the tailoring rules the federal reserve and fdic finalized rules in october which among other things adjust the review cycles and applicability of the agencies resolution planning requirements under these new rules category iv firms such as regions are no longer required to submit resolution plans in april the fdic released an advance notice of proposed rulemaking about potential changes to its resolution planning requirements for insured depository institutions such as regions bank and the next round of insured depository institution resolution plan submissions will not be required until the rulemaking process is complete regions bank submitted its most recent resolution plan in june on february the federal reserve provided relief to certain bhcs with assets between billion and billion including regions in the form of a oneyear extension to the requirement to submit a capital plan to the federal reserve thus regions was not required to submit a capital plan to the federal reserve in but must submit a plan by april in addition regions was not subject to the supervisory capital stress testing or the companyrun capital stress testing requirements for but will be subject to supervisory capital stress testing for however regions is still required to develop a capital plan that is reviewed and approved by regions board of directors on an annual basis furthermore while regions was not required to submit a full capital plan to the federal reserve in the company was required to submit its planned capital actions for the period between july and june the federal reserve has announced that for the period from july through june regions like other firms granted an extension is approved to make capital distributions up to the amount that would have allowed the firm to remain above all minimum capital requirements in ccar adjusted for any changes in regions regulatory capital ratios since the federal reserve acted on regions capital plan regions cannot predict future changes in the applicable laws regulations and regulatory agency policies yet such changes may have a material impact on regions business financial condition or results of operations we will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes in law and any new regulations promulgated including changes in regulatory costs and fees modifications to consumer products or disclosures required by the cfpb and the requirements of the enhanced supervision provisions among others permissible activities under the bhc act in general the bhc act limits the activities permissible for bhcs to the business of banking managing or controlling banks and such other activities as the federal reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be properly incidental thereto a bhc electing to be treated as a fhc like regions may also engage in a range of activities that are i financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity or ii complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of a depository institution or to the financial system generally these activities include securities dealing underwriting and market making insurance underwriting and agency activities merchant banking and insurance company portfolio investments for a bhc to be eligible to elect fhc status all of its subsidiary insured depository institutions must be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged as described below under regulatory remedies under the fdia and must have received at least a satisfactory rating on such institutions most recent examination under the cra the bhc itself must also be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged in order to be eligible to elect fhc status if an fhc fails to continue to be wellcapitalized or wellmanaged after engaging in activities not permissible for bhcs that have not elected to be treated as financial holding companies the company must enter into an agreement with the federal reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements if the company does not return to compliance within days the federal reserve may order the company to divest its subsidiary banks or the company may be required to discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bhc electing to be treated as an fhc furthermore if the federal reserve determines that an fhc has not maintained a cra rating of at least satisfactory the fhc would not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities although the fhc would still be allowed to engage in activities closely related to banking and make investments in the ordinary course of conducting banking activities the bhc act does not place territorial restrictions on permissible nonbanking activities of bhcs the federal reserve has the power to order any bhc or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the federal reserve has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bhc capital requirements regions and regions bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve which are based on the basel iii framework the basel iiibased us capital rules among other things impose a capital measure called common equity tier capital or cet1 capital to which most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures must be made in addition the basel iiibased us capital rules specify that tier capital consists of cet1 and additional tier capital instruments meeting certain specified requirements under the us basel iiibased capital rules the minimum capital ratios are cet1 capital to riskweighted assets tier capital that is cet1 capital plus additional tier capital to riskweighted assets total capital that is tier capital plus tier capital to riskweighted assets and tier capital to total average consolidated assets as defined under us basel iii standardized approach known as the leverage ratio the us capital rules also impose a ccb of on top of the three minimum riskweighted asset ratios listed above banking institutions that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios once the ccb is taken into account that is for cet1 capital to riskweighted assets for tier capital to riskweighted assets and for total capital to riskweighted assets will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation the severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institutions eligible retained income that is four quarter trailing net income net of distributions and tax effects not reflected in net income on april the federal reserve issued a proposal designed to create a single integrated capital requirement by combining the quantitative assessment of firms capital plans with the ccb requirement details of this proposal are discussed under comprehensive capital analysis and review and stress testing below although the proposal if adopted would change the way in which the minimum ratios are calculated firms would continue to be subject to progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions as they approach the minimum ratios in december the basel committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the basel iii postcrisis regulatory reforms the standards are commonly referred to as basel iv among other things these standards revise the basel committees standardized approach for credit risk including recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain unconditionally cancellable commitments such as unused credit card and home equity lines of credit and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital under the basel framework these standards will generally be effective on january with an aggregate output floor phasing in through january under the current us basel iii rules operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions and not to regions or regions bank the impact of basel iv will depend on the manner in which it is implemented in the us with respect to firms such as regions and regions bank for more information see the regulatory requirements section of item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k leverage requirements bhcs and banks are also required to comply with minimum leverage capital requirements these requirements provide for a minimum ratio of tier capital to total consolidated average tangible assets as defined for regulatory purposes called the leverage ratio of for all bhcs liquidity requirements under the aforementioned tailoring rules category iv firms with less than billion in wstwf including regions are no longer subject to a lcr requirement however category iv firms remain subject to minimum liquidity buffers and liquidity stress testing requirements though the minimum frequency of such testing has been revised to quarterly rather than monthly the tailoring rules also adjusted liquidity risk management requirements such that category iv firms are required to i calculate collateral positions monthly as opposed to weekly ii establish a more limited set of liquidity risk limits than was previously required and iii monitor fewer elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures category iv firms are required to continue reporting liquidity data on the fr on a monthly basis the nsfr was designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banks over a oneyear time horizon in may the us banking regulators issued a proposed rule to implement the nsfr for large us banking organizations under the proposal bhcs with less than billion but more than billion in total consolidated assets and less than billion in onbalance sheet foreign exposure such as regions would have been subject to a less stringent modified nsfr requirement although the nsfr has not been finalized it is expected that the framework for applying any finalized nsfr will be consistent with the approach for the lcr requirement under the tailoring rules comprehensive capital analysis and review and stress testing the federal reserve currently conducts analyses of bhcs with at least billion in total consolidated assets to determine whether the firms have sufficient capital on a consolidated basis necessary to absorb losses in baseline and severely adverse economic conditions under the tailoring rules category iv firms including regions are now subject to supervisory stress testing every other year rather than annually and are no longer subject to companyrun stress testing requirements but remain subject to the quantitative review of their capital plans under ccar to required capital plan submissions and to the fr y14 reporting requirements us bhcs with total consolidated assets of billion or more such as regions must annually develop and maintain a capital plan and must submit the capital plan to the federal reserve as part of the federal reserves ccar process the ccar process is intended to help ensure that these bhcs have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for each companys unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress as noted above in connection with the finalization of the tailoring rules the federal reserve stated that it expects to revise its guidance relating to capital planning to align with the categories of standards set forth in the tailoring rules and the impact of the future proposal on regions and its capital planning process will depend on the final form of the federal reserves revised guidance as previously noted above on april the federal reserve issued a proposal designed to create a single integrated capital requirement by combining the quantitative assessment of ccar with the ccb requirement if adopted the proposal would replace the current static ccb with a scb requirement the scb subject to a minimum of would reflect stressed losses in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the federal reserves supervisory stress tests and would also include four quarters of planned common stock dividends the proposal would also introduce a slb requirement similar to the scb which would apply to the tier leverage ratio in addition the proposal would eliminate the quantitative objection provisions of ccar but would require a bhc to reduce its planned capital distributions if those distributions would not be consistent with the applicable capital buffer constraints based on the bhcs own baseline scenario projections the federal reserve has stated that it intends to propose revisions to the stress buffer requirements that would be applicable to category iv bhcs to align with the twoyear supervisory stress testing cycle for category iv bhcs in addition to other limitations our ability to make capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases is contingent on the federal reserves nonobjection to our capital plan should the federal reserve object to a capital plan a bhc may not make any capital distribution other than those capital distributions to which the federal reserve has indicated its nonobjection in writing our annual capital planning submission is currently due by april and the federal reserve will publish the results of its supervisory ccar review of our capital plan by june as noted above the tailoring rules which changed the supervisory stress testing cycle from annual to biennial did not similarly amend the federal reserves capital plan rule but the federal reserve indicated that it expects to release a future proposal to do so safety and soundness standards the fdia requires the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements the fdia establishes five capital categories wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized and the federal banking agencies must take certain mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized the severity of these mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed generally subject to a narrow exception the fdia requires the banking regulator to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized as of december both regions and regions bank were wellcapitalized an institution that is classified as wellcapitalized based on its capital levels may be treated as adequately capitalized and an institution that is adequately capitalized or undercapitalized based upon its capital levels may be treated as though it were undercapitalized or significantly undercapitalized respectively if the appropriate federal banking agency after notice and opportunity for hearing determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment an institution that is categorized as undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking regulator under the fdia in order for the capital restoration plan to be accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency a bhc must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution will comply with its capital restoration plan subject to certain limitations the bhc must also provide appropriate assurances of performance the fdia requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain noncapital standards for safety and soundness relating generally to operations and management asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards regulators also must take into consideration i concentrations of credit risk ii interest rate risk when the interest rate sensitivity of an institutions assets does not match the sensitivity of its liabilities or its offbalance sheet position and iii risks from nontraditional activities as well as an institutions ability to manage those risks when determining the adequacy of an institutions capital regulators make this evaluation as a part of their regular examination of the institutions safety and soundness additionally regulators may choose to examine other factors in order to evaluate the safety and soundness of financial institutions payment of dividends we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banking and other subsidiaries the principal source of cash flow to us including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders and principal and interest on any of our outstanding debt is dividends from regions bank there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by regions bank to us as well as by us to our stockholders if in the opinion of a federal bank regulatory agency an institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice such agency may require after notice and hearing that such institution cease and desist from such practice the federal bank regulatory agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete an institutions capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice under the fdia an insured institution may not pay a dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized see safety and soundness standards above moreover the federal reserve and the fdic have issued policy statements stating that bhcs and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings payment of dividends by regions bank under the federal reserves regulation h regions bank may not without approval of the federal reserve declare or pay a dividend to regions if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year exceeds the total of a regions banks net income for that year and b its retained net income for the preceding two calendar years less any required transfers to additional paidin capital or to a fund for the retirement of preferred stock under alabama law regions bank may not pay a dividend in excess of of its net earnings unless its surplus is equal to at least of capital regions bank is also required by alabama law to seek the approval of the alabama superintendent of banking prior to the payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by regions bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of a regions banks net earnings for that year plus b its retained net earnings for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus the statute defines net earnings as the remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and other assets after deducting from the total thereof all current operating expenses actual losses accrued dividends on preferred stock if any and all federal state and local taxes regions bank cannot without approval from the federal reserve and the alabama superintendent of banking declare or pay a dividend to regions unless regions bank is able to satisfy the criteria discussed above payment of dividends by regions our payment of dividends to our stockholders is subject to the oversight of the federal reserve in particular the dividend policies and share repurchases of a large bhc such as regions are reviewed by the federal reserve based on capital plans submitted as part of the ccar process and stress tests as submitted by the bhc see capital requirements and comprehensive capital analysis and review and stress testing above support of subsidiary banks under longstanding federal reserve policy which has been codified by the doddfrank act regions is expected to act as a source of financial strength to and to commit resources to support its subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when regions may not be inclined to provide it in addition any capital loans by a bhc to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank in the event of a bhcs bankruptcy any commitment by the bhc to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment transactions with affiliates sections and of the federal reserve act and the federal reserves regulation w restrict transactions between a bank and its affiliates including a parent bhc regions bank is subject to these restrictions which include quantitative and qualitative limits on the amounts and types of transactions that may take place including extensions of credit to affiliates investments in the stock or securities of affiliates purchases of assets from affiliates and certain other transactions with affiliates these restrictions also require that credit transactions with affiliates be collateralized and that transactions with affiliates be on market terms or better for the bank generally a banks covered transactions with any affiliate are limited to of the banks capital stock and surplus and covered transactions with all affiliates are limited to of the banks capital stock and surplus deposit insurance regions bank accepts deposits and those deposits have the benefit of fdic insurance up to the applicable limits under the fdia insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the insured depository institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by a banks federal regulatory agency regions bank pays deposit insurance premiums to the fdic based on an assessment rate established by the fdic fdic assessment rates for large institutions with more than billion in assets such as regions bank are calculated based on a scorecard methodology that seeks to capture both the probability that an individual large institution will fail and the magnitude of the impact on the deposit insurance fund if such a failure occurs based primarily on the difference between the institutions average of total assets and average tangible equity the fdic has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score up or down based upon significant risk factors that may not be adequately captured in the scorecard for large institutions including regions bank after accounting for potential baserate adjustments the total base assessment rate could range from to basis points on an annualized basis for more information see the fdic insurance assessments section of item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k acquisitions the bhc act requires every bhc to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before i it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or savings and loan association if after such acquisition the bhc will directly or indirectly own or control or more of the voting shares of the institution ii it or any of its subsidiaries other than a bank may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings and loan association or iii it may merge or consolidate with any other bhc fhcs must obtain prior approval from the federal reserve before acquiring certain nonbank financial companies with assets exceeding billion fhcs seeking approval to complete an acquisition must be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged the bhc act further provides that the federal reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the us or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served the federal reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bhcs and banks impacted and the convenience and needs of the community to be served consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy and the consideration of convenience and needs of the community to be served includes the parties performance under the cra the federal reserve must also take into account the institutions effectiveness in combating money laundering in addition pursuant to the doddfrank act the bhc act was amended to require the federal reserve to when evaluating a proposed transaction consider the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the us banking or financial system depositor preference under federal law claims of depositors and certain claims for both administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver volcker rule the doddfrank act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in sponsoring and having certain relationships with private funds such as hedge funds or private equity funds that would be considered an investment company for purposes of the volcker rule the final rules implementing the volcker rule also require that large bhcs such as regions design and implement compliance programs to ensure adherence to the volcker rules prohibitions development and monitoring of the required compliance program may require the expenditure of resources and management attention in october the federal reserve occ fdic cftc and sec finalized rules to tailor the application of the volcker rule based on the size and scope of a banking entitys trading activities and to clarify and amend certain definitions requirements and exemptions these regulators have also stated their intention to engage in further rulemaking with respect to the implementing regulations relating to covered funds including potential changes to the definition of covered fund and the prohibitions on certain covered transactions consumer protection laws we are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws including laws designed to protect customers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population these laws include but are not limited to the equal credit opportunity act the fair credit reporting act the truth in lending act the home mortgage disclosure act the real estate settlement procedures act the truth in savings act the electronic funds transfer act and their respective state law counterparts the cfpb has broad rulemaking supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws including the laws referenced above fair lending laws and certain other statutes the cfpb also has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with billion or more in assets including the authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products financial privacy and cybersecurity the federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party these regulations affect how consumer information is used in diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors in addition consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service such as that shown on consumer credit reports and application information consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services the federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management standards among financial institutions a financial institution is expected to establish multiple lines of defense and to ensure their risk management processes address the risk posed by potential threats to the institution a financial institutions management is expected to maintain sufficient processes to effectively respond and recover the institutions operations after a cyberattack a financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations if a critical service provider of the institution falls victim to this type of cyberattack the regions information security program reflects the requirements of this guidance state regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations recently several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs including data encryption requirements many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements for example the california consumer privacy act became effective on january we expect this trend of statelevel activity in those areas to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which our customers are located community reinvestment act regions bank is subject to the provisions of the cra under the terms of the cra regions bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its communities including providing credit to individuals residing in low and moderateincome neighborhoods the cra requires each appropriate federal bank regulatory agency in connection with its examination of a depository institution to assess such institutions record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of the community served by that institution including low and moderateincome neighborhoods the regulatory agencys assessment is part of the federal reserves consideration of applications by a bank or bhc to acquire merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits or to relocate an office in the case of a bhc applicant the federal reserve will assess the records of each subsidiary depository institution of the applicant bhc and such records may be the basis for denying the application in april the us department of treasury issued a memorandum to the federal banking regulators with recommended changes to the cras implementing regulations to reduce their complexity and associated burden on banks subsequently in december the occ and fdic issued a notice of proposed rulemaking intended update and modernize the cras implementing regulations however the federal reserve has not issued any proposed changes we will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the regulations implementing the cra regions banks most recent cra rating from the federal reserve is satisfactory compensation practices our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the federal reserve the federal banking regulators have provided guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices the guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements i the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ii the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management and iii the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance the guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated as appropriate into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions the guidance also provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness antimoney laundering a continued focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing the usa patriot act broadened the application of antimoney laundering regulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions such as brokerdealers investment advisors and insurance companies and strengthened the ability of the us government to help prevent detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism the principal provisions of title iii of the usa patriot act require that regulated financial institutions including state member banks i establish an antimoney laundering program that includes training and audit components ii comply with regulations regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to open an account iii take additional required precautions with nonus owned accounts and iv perform certain verification and certification of money laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships failure of a financial institution to comply with the usa patriot acts requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution regions banking subsidiary has augmented its systems and procedures to meet the requirements of these regulations and will continue to revise and update their policies procedures and controls to reflect changes required by the usa patriot act and implementing regulations the usa patriot act also requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition fincen which drafts regulations implementing the usa patriot act and other antimoney laundering and bank secrecy act legislation has adopted rules that require financial institutions to obtain beneficial ownership information with respect to legal entities with which such institutions conduct business subject to certain exclusions and exemptions bank regulators are focusing their examinations on
