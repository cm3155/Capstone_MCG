authorities cannot be predicted but may have a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations overview as a bhc regions is subject to regulation under the bhc act and to regulation examination and supervision by the federal reserve regions has elected to be treated as an fhc which allows it to engage in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permissible for a bhc the bhc act provides for umbrella regulation of fhcs by the federal reserve and functional regulation of holding company subsidiaries by applicable regulatory agencies the bhc act also requires the federal reserve to examine any subsidiary of a bhc other than a depository institution engaged in activities permissible for a depository institution the federal reserve is also granted the authority in certain circumstances to require reports of examine and adopt rules applicable to any holding company subsidiary regions bank is an alabama statechartered bank and a member of the federal reserve system its operations are generally subject to supervision and examination by both the federal reserve and the alabama state banking department regions bank is also affected by the actions of the federal reserve as it implements monetary policy as a federal reserve system member bank regions bank is required to hold stock in the federal reserve bank of atlanta in an amount equal

including the sec cftc finra and the nyse regions bank is also subject to additional state and federal laws as well as various compliance regulations that govern its activities the investments it makes and the aggregate amount of loans that may be granted to one borrower examinations by regions regulators consider not only compliance with applicable laws regulations and supervisory policies of the agency but also capital levels asset quality risk management effectiveness the ability and performance of management and the board of directors the effectiveness of internal controls earnings liquidity interest rate risk management and various other factors following those examinations regions and regions bank are assigned supervisory ratings this supervisory framework including the examination reports and supervisory ratings which are considered confidential supervisory information could materially impact the conduct growth and profitability of regions operations under the federal reserves large financial institution rating system component ratings are assigned for capital planning liquidity risk management and governance and controls to be considered well managed under this rating system a firm must be rated broadly meets expectations or conditionally meets expectations for each of its three component ratings the results of examinations by any of regions federal bank regulators potentially can result in the imposition of significant limitations on regions activities and growth these regulatory agencies generally have broad enforcement authority and discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity including the imposition of substantial monetary penalties and nonmonetary requirements against a regulated entity where the relevant agency determines that the operations of the regulated entity or any of its subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations are conducted in an unsafe or unsound manner or represent an unfair or deceptive act or practice enhanced prudential standards and regulatory tailoring rules as a bhc with over billion in total consolidated assets we are subject to enhanced prudential standards and capital rules the tailoring rules the tailoring rules assign each us bhc with billion or more in total consolidated assets as well as its bank subsidiaries to one of four categories based on its size and five other riskbased indicators crossjurisdictional activity wstwf nonbank assets offbalance sheet exposure and status as a us gsib under the tailoring rules regions and regions bank are each subject to category iv standards which apply to banking organizations with at least billion in total consolidated assets that do not meet any of the thresholds specified for categories i through iii firms subject to category iv standards are generally subject to the same capital and liquidity requirements as firms with less than billion in total consolidated assets but are among other things subject to certain enhanced prudential standards and also required to monitor and report certain riskbased indicators accordingly under the tailoring rules category iv firms are among other things not subject to lcr or nsfr requirements or in certain cases subject to reduced requirements remain eligible to optout of the requirement to recognize most elements of aoci in regulatory capital not subject to companyrun capital stress testing requirements subject to supervisory capital stress testing on a biennial instead of annual basis subject to requirements to develop and maintain a capital plan on an annual basis and subject to certain liquidity risk management and risk committee requirements permissible activities under the bhc act the bhc act limits the activities permissible for bhcs to the business of banking managing or controlling banks and such other activities as the federal reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be properly incidental thereto a bhc electing to be treated as a fhc like regions may also engage in a range of activities that are i financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity or ii complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of a depository institution or to the financial system generally these activities include securities dealing underwriting and market making insurance underwriting and agency activities merchant banking and insurance company portfolio investments the federal reserve has the authority to limit an fhcs ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities if the fhc or any of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases to meet applicable eligibility requirements the federal reserve may also impose corrective capital andor managerial requirements on the fhc and if deficiencies are persistent may require the company to divest its subsidiary banks or the company may be required to discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bhc electing to be treated as an fhc furthermore if the federal reserve determines that an fhc has not maintained a cra rating of at least satisfactory the fhc would not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities although the fhc would still be allowed to engage in activities closely related to banking and make investments in the ordinary course of conducting banking activities the federal reserve has the power to order any bhc or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the federal reserve has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bhc regulatory capital requirements regions and regions bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve which are based on the basel iii framework the basel iiibased us capital rules among other things include both riskbased requirements which compare three measures of capital to rwas as well as leverage requirements which in the case of category iv banking organizations such as regions consist of the tier leverage ratio described below the capital rules also require firms to maintain a buffer referred to as the scb consisting of solely cet1 capital in addition to the minimum riskbased requirements failure to satisfy the buffer requirement in full results in graduated constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and discretionary executive compensation the extent to which capital distributions will be constrained depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institutions eligible retained income which is defined as the greater of a banking institutions net income for the four preceding calendar quarters net of any distributions to shareholders and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income and the average of a banking institutions net income over the preceding four quarters as a category iv banking organization regions scb is determined through the federal reserves ccar supervisory stress tests which include analyses using baseline and severely adverse economic and financial scenarios regions scb requirement is determined by adding the federal reserves modeled capital degradation in the supervisory severely adverse scenario plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends as a category iv banking organization the capital degradation component of the scb is calculated every other year in evennumbered years during a year in which a category iv banking organization does not undergo a supervisory stress test it will receive an updated scb requirement that reflects its updated planned common stock dividends a category iv banking organization is also able to elect to participate in the supervisory stress test in a year in which it would not normally be subject to the supervisory stress test and consequently receive an updated scb requirement the scb is subject to a percent floor while regions was not required to participate in supervisory stress testing the company did receive its scb reflecting planned capital changes including plans to increase its common stock dividend for the fourth quarter of through the third quarter of the scb continues to be floored at percent the regulatory minimum for regions bank the buffer requirement is the percent scb see note regulatory capital requirements and restrictions in item financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k for details on minimum capital ratios and those needed to be well capitalized regions is also subject to rules that provide for simplified capital requirements relating to the threshold deductions for mortgage servicing assets deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that a banking organization could not realize through net operating loss carry backs and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions as well as the inclusion of minority interests in regulatory capital as a category iv banking organization regions must also develop and maintain a capital plan and must submit the capital plan to the federal reserve as part of the ccar process the ccar process is intended to help ensure that bhcs have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for each companys unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress in addition the federal reserves capital plan rule relating to the ccar process provides that a bhc must receive prior approval for any dividend stock repurchase or other capital distribution if the bhc is required to resubmit its capital plan subject to an exception for distributions on newly issued capital instruments among other circumstances a bhc may be required to resubmit its capital plan in connection with certain acquisitions or dispositions in the us federal banking agencies published a final rule to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of cecl the final rule provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of cecls effect on regulatory capital relative to the incurred loss methodologys effect on regulatory capital followed by a threeyear transition period fiveyear transition option regions adopted the capital transition relief over the permissible fiveyear period in july the us banking regulators issued a proposal to revise the riskbased capital standards applicable to regions which generally aligns with the global basel accord the proposal would introduce a new measure of riskweighted assets which would reflect the proposed new standardized approaches for credit risk operational risk and credit valuation adjustment risk as well as a proposed new measure for market risk that would be based on both internal models and standardized supervisory models of market risk for category iii and iv institutions this includes removing the aoci optout in calculating regulatory capital the proposed effective date is july subject to a threeyear transition period ending july over which the expanded total riskweighted assets would be phased in the company will continue to evaluate this proposal as well as any potential future changes to the proposal and the potential impacts on regions in august the us banking regulators proposed a rule that would require banking organizations with billion or more in total assets to comply with longterm debt requirements and clean holding company requirements that currently apply only to global systemically important banking organizations this proposal would also impose a longterm debt requirement on certain categories of idis including idis with billion or more in total assets such as regions bank if adopted this proposal would require the company and regions bank to each maintain a minimum outstanding eligible longterm debt amount of no less than the greatest of i of riskweighted assets ii of total leverage exposure and iii of average total consolidated assets regions bank would be required to issue the minimum amount of eligible longterm debt to the company and the company would be required to issue the minimum amount of eligible longterm debt externally in addition if adopted as proposed the clean holding company requirement would limit or prohibit the company from entering into certain transactions that could impede its orderly resolution including for example prohibiting the company from entering into transactions that could spread losses to subsidiaries and third parties as well as limiting the amount of the companys liabilities that are not eligible longterm this proposal is subject to a comment period the company will continue to evaluate this proposal and the potential impacts if adopted as proposed for more information see the regulatory requirements section of item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k liquidity requirements under the tailoring rules category iv firms with less than billion in wstwf including regions and regions bank are not subject to a lcr requirement or any nsfr requirement however bhcs that are category iv firms are subject to minimum monthly liquidity buffers and liquidity stress testing requirements under the federal reserves enhanced prudential standards furthermore as a category iv firm regions is obligated at a minimum to i calculate collateral positions monthly ii establish a more limited set of liquidity risk limits iii monitor elements of intraday liquidity risk exposures and iv report liquidity data on the fr on a monthly basis resolution planning category iv firms such as regions are not required to submit 165d resolution plans the fdic separately requires insured depositary institutions with billion or more in total assets such as regions bank to submit to the fdic periodic plans for resolution in the event of the banks failure regions bank submitted its most recent resolution plan in november in august the fdic issued a proposal to amend its rules requiring covered idis including regions bank to periodically submit resolution plans to the fdic if adopted as proposed regions bank would be required to submit a full resolution plan to the fdic every two years and submit an interim supplement in each year that it is not required to submit a full resolution plan in addition this proposal would increase the content requirements for plan submissions and introduce a new credibility standard for the fdics evaluation of resolution plans which would be enforceable against the covered idis enforcement authority the federal banking agencies have broad authority to issue orders to depository institutions and their holding companies prohibiting activities that constitute violations of law rule regulation or administrative order or that represent unsafe or unsound banking practices as determined by the federal banking agencies the federal banking agencies also are empowered to require affirmative actions to correct any violation or practice issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced direct increases in capital limit dividends and distributions restrict growth assess civil money penalties against institutions or individuals who violate any laws regulations orders or written agreements with the agencies order termination of certain activities of holding companies or their nonbank subsidiaries remove officers and directors order divestiture of ownership or control of a nonbanking subsidiary by a holding company or terminate deposit insurance and appoint a conservator or receiver fdia and prompt corrective action the fdia requires the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements the fdia establishes five capital categories wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized and the federal banking agencies must take certain mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized the severity of these mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed subject to a narrow exception the fdia requires the banking regulator to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized as of december both regions and regions bank were wellcapitalized an institution that is classified as wellcapitalized based on its capital levels may be treated as adequately capitalized and an institution that is adequately capitalized or undercapitalized based upon its capital levels may be treated as though it were undercapitalized or significantly undercapitalized respectively if the appropriate federal banking agency after notice and opportunity for hearing determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment an institution that is categorized as undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking regulator under the fdia in order for the capital restoration plan to be accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency a bhc must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution will comply with its capital restoration plan subject to certain limitations the bhc must also provide appropriate assurances of performance the fdia requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain noncapital standards for safety and soundness relating generally to operations and management asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards regulators also must take into consideration i concentrations of credit risk ii interest rate risk when the interest rate sensitivity of an institutions assets does not match the sensitivity of its liabilities or its offbalance sheet position and iii risks from nontraditional activities as well as an institutions ability to manage those risks when determining the adequacy of an institutions capital regulators make this evaluation as a part of their regular examination of the institutions safety and soundness additionally regulators may choose to examine other factors in order to evaluate the safety and soundness of financial institutions safety and soundness the federal banking agencies have adopted a set of guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards relating to internal controls and information systems informational security internal audit systems loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate exposure asset growth and compensation fees and benefits the guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer employee director or principal shareholder properly managing risks is critical to the conduct of safe and sound banking activities and has become even more important as new technologies product innovation and the size and speed of financial transactions have changed the nature of banking markets the agencies have identified a spectrum of risks facing banking institutions including but not limited to credit market liquidity operational legal compliance and reputational risk some of the regulatory pronouncements have focused on operational risk which arises from the potential that inadequate information systems operational problems breaches in internal controls fraud or unforeseen catastrophes will result in unexpected losses new products and services thirdparty risk management and cybersecurity are critical sources of operational risk that financial institutions are expected to address in the current environment regions bank is expected to have active board and senior management oversight adequate policies procedures and limits adequate risk measurement monitoring and management information systems and comprehensive and effective internal controls payment of dividends regions is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries the principal source of cash flow to us including cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest on any of our outstanding debt is dividends from regions bank there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by regions bank to us as well as by us to our shareholders if in the opinion of a federal bank regulatory agency an institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice such agency may require after notice and hearing that such institution cease and desist from such practice the federal bank regulatory agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete an institutions capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice under the fdia an insured institution may not pay a dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized see safety and soundness standards above moreover the federal reserve and the fdic have issued policy statements stating that bhcs and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings payment of dividends by regions bank under the federal reserves regulation h regions bank may not without approval of the federal reserve declare or pay a dividend to regions if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year exceeds the total of a regions banks net income for that year and b its retained net income for the preceding two calendar years less any required transfers to additional paidin capital or to a fund for the retirement of preferred stock under alabama law regions bank may not pay a dividend in excess of of its net earnings unless its surplus is equal to at least of capital regions bank is also required by alabama law to seek the approval of the alabama superintendent of banking prior to the payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by regions bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of a regions banks net earnings for that year plus b its retained net earnings for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus the statute defines net earnings as the remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and other assets after deducting from the total thereof all current operating expenses actual losses accrued dividends on preferred stock if any and all federal state and local taxes regions bank cannot without approval from the federal reserve and the alabama superintendent of banking declare or pay a dividend to regions unless regions bank is able to satisfy the criteria discussed above payment of dividends by regions payment of dividends to our shareholders is subject to the oversight of the federal reserve in particular the dividend policies and share repurchases of a large bhc such as regions are reviewed by the federal reserve based on capital plans submitted as part of the ccar process and may be constrained in certain scenarios see capital requirements above support of subsidiary banks under the doddfrank act regions is expected to act as a source of financial strength to and to commit resources to support its subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when regions may not be inclined to provide it limits on exposure to one borrower and exposure to insiders alabama banking law imposes limits on the amount of credit a bank can extend to any one person or group of related persons for regions bank this limit includes credit exposures arising from loan and equivalent exposure and investment and trading exposure applicable banking laws and regulations also place restrictions on loans by fdicinsured banks and their affiliates to their directors executive officers and principal shareholders lending standards and guidance the federal banking agencies have adopted uniform regulations prescribing standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate under these regulations all idis such as regions bank must adopt and maintain written policies establishing appropriate limits and standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or are made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate these policies must establish loan portfolio diversification standards prudent underwriting standards including loantovalue limits that are clear and measurable loan administration procedures and documentation approval and reporting requirements the real estate lending policies must reflect consideration of the federal bank regulators interagency guidelines for real estate lending policies de novo branching and de novo banks with the approval of applicable regulators state banks may establish de novo branches in states other than their home state as if such state was

that the customer obtain some additional product or service from the bank or any of its affiliates other than loans deposits and trust services transactions with affiliates sections and of the federal reserve act and the federal reserves regulation w restrict transactions between a bank and its affiliates including a parent bhc regions bank is subject to these restrictions which include quantitative and qualitative limits on the amounts and types of transactions that may take place including extensions of credit to affiliates investments in the stock or securities of affiliates purchases of assets from affiliates and certain other transactions with affiliates these restrictions also require that credit transactions with affiliates be collateralized and that transactions with

affiliates are limited to of the banks capital stock and surplus deposit insurance regions banks deposits are insured by the fdic up to the applicable limits which is currently per account ownership type the fdic imposes a riskbased deposit premium assessment system that determines assessment rates for an idi based on an assessment rate calculator which is based on a number of elements to measure the risk each idi poses to the dif the assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity as defined under the doddfrank act the assessment rate schedule can change from time to time at the discretion of the fdic subject to certain limits under the current system premiums are assessed quarterly the fdic as required under the fdia established a plan in september to restore the dif reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of percent within eight years this plan did not include an increase in the deposit insurance assessment rate based on the fdics recent projections however the fdic determined that the dif reserve ratio is at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum by the statutory deadline of september without increasing the deposit insurance assessment rates during the fdic adopted a final rule to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules by basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of this rule combined with other factors influenced by regions financial performance increased regulatory premiums in the fdic also concurrently maintained the designated reserve ratio for the dif at percent in november the fdic issued a final rule to implement a special assessment to recoup losses to the dif associated with bank failures in the first half of under the rule the assessment base for the special assessment is equal to an idis estimated uninsured deposits reported as of december adjusted to exclude the first billion of uninsured deposits the special assessment for regions is estimated

or more deposit accounts to maintain complete and accurate data on each depositors ownership interest by right and capacity and to develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner by ownership right and capacity acquisitions the bhc act requires every bhc to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before i it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or savings and loan association if after such acquisition the bhc will directly or indirectly own or control or more of the voting shares of the institution ii it or any of its subsidiaries other than a bank may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings and loan association or iii it may merge or consolidate with any other bhc fhcs must obtain prior approval from the federal reserve before acquiring certain nonbank financial companies with assets exceeding billion fhcs seeking approval to complete an acquisition must be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged the bhc act further provides that the federal reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the us or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served the federal reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bhcs and banks impacted and the convenience and needs of the community to be served consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy and the consideration of convenience and needs of the community to be served includes the parties performance under the cra the federal reserve must also take into account the institutions effectiveness in combating money laundering in addition pursuant to the doddfrank act the bhc act was amended to require the federal reserve to when evaluating a proposed transaction consider the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the us banking or financial system in july the biden administration issued an executive order on competition which included provisions relating to bank mergers these provisions encourage the department of justice and the federal banking regulators to update guidelines on banking mergers and to provide more scrutiny of bank mergers depositor preference under federal law claims of depositors and certain claims for both administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver volcker rule the doddfrank act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in sponsoring and having certain relationships with private funds such as hedge funds or private equity funds that would be considered an investment company for purposes of the volcker rule the compliance requirements under regulations implementing the volcker rule are tailored based on the size and scope of trading activities because tal are maintained under billion regions is categorized with limited tal and benefits from a presumption of compliance with the volcker rule regions has put in place the compliance programs required by the volcker rule and has either divested or received extensions for any holdings in illiquid funds consumer protection laws we are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws including laws designed to protect customers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population these laws include but are not limited to the equal credit opportunity act the fair credit reporting act the truth in lending act the home mortgage disclosure act the real estate settlement procedures act the truth in savings act the electronic funds transfer act the consumer financial protection act and their respective state law counterparts the cfpb has broad rulemaking supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws including the laws referenced above other fair lending laws and certain other statutes the cfpb also has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to consumer financial laws for depository institutions with billion or more in assets including the authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products the cfpb may issue regulations that impact products and services offered by regions or regions bank the regulations could reduce the fees that regions receives alter the way regions provides its products and services or expose regions to greater risk of private litigation or regulatory enforcement action privacy and cybersecurity we are or may in the future become subject to a variety of complex and evolving laws regulations rules and standards at the federal state and local level regarding privacy and cybersecurity privacy and cybersecurity are currently areas of considerable legislative and regulatory attention with new or modified laws regulations rules and standards being frequently adopted and potentially subject to divergent interpretation or application in a manner that may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements for businesses privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations often impose strict requirements regarding the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer protection and other processing of personal information which may have adverse consequences on our business including incurring significant compliance costs requiring changes to our business or operations and imposing severe penalties for noncompliance for example at the federal level the federal banking regulators have adopted certain rules including pursuant to the glba that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic personal information about consumers to third parties these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties in addition consumers may also prevent disclosure among affiliated companies of certain nonpublic personal information that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service such as that shown on consumer credit reports and application information consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share certain information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services federal law also requires financial institutions to implement a written information security program that includes administrative technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities the program should be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information protect against unanticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer financial institutions must also conduct ongoing oversight of thirdparty service providers to ensure they are maintaining appropriate security controls financial institutions must report on the institutions cybersecurity program annually to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors the federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management standards among financial institutions a financial institution is expected to establish multiple lines of defense against security threats and to ensure their risk management processes appropriately address the risk posed by potential threats to the institution a financial institutions management is expected to maintain sufficient processes to effectively identify prevent and detect a cyberattack a financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations if a critical service provider of the institution falls victim to cyberattack the regions information security program is designed to reflect the requirements of these regulatory requirements and guidance in addition in the spring of federal banking regulators have imposed a new cybersecurityrelated notification rule that requires banking organizations including regions and regions bank to notify their primary federal regulator as soon as possible and within hours of incidents that among other things have materially disrupted or degraded or are reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade the banking organizations ability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base jeopardize the viability of key operations of the banking organization or impact the stability of the financial sector the rule also imposes requirements on bank service providers to notify their affected banking organization customers of certain computersecurity incidents further in the sec issued regulations requiring public companies to disclose certain information regarding material cybersecurity incidents impacting those companies as well as descriptions about how they manage material cybersecurity risks state regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity laws regulations rules and standards several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and have provided detailed requirements with respect to these programs including data encryption requirements many states have also implemented or are considering implementing comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations such as the ccpa in addition laws in all us states generally require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to individuals whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach we expect this trend of statelevel activity to persist and we are continually monitoring developments in the states in which our customers are located moreover the united states congress has considered and is currently considering various proposals for more comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity legislation to which regions andor regions bank may be subject to if passed in october the cfpb proposed a rule to implement section of the doddfrank act sometimes referred to as the doddfrank acts open banking provision which would require certain entities including regions and regions bank to comply with an established framework to govern consumer access to electronic financial data the company continues to monitor this proposal and evaluate the potential impacts if adopted as proposed or otherwise on regions and regions bank community reinvestment act the cra requires regions banks primary federal bank regulatory agency the federal reserve to assess the banks record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank including low and moderateincome neighborhoods and persons institutions are assigned one of four ratings outstanding satisfactory needs to improve or substantial noncompliance this assessment is considered for any bank that applies to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of an idi or to open or relocate a branch office the
