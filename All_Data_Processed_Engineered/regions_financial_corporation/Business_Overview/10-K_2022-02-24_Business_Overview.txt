regulations promulgated including changes in regulatory costs and fees modifications to consumer products or disclosures required by the cfpb and the requirements of the enhanced supervision provisions among others permissible activities under the bhc act in general the bhc act limits the activities permissible for bhcs to the business of banking managing or controlling banks and such other activities as the federal reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be properly incidental thereto a bhc electing to be treated as a fhc like regions may also engage in a range of activities that are i financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity or ii complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of a depository institution or to the financial system generally these activities include securities dealing underwriting and market making insurance underwriting and agency activities merchant banking and insurance company portfolio investments for a bhc to be eligible to elect and maintain fhc status all of its subsidiary insured depository institutions must be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged as described below under regulatory remedies under the fdia and must have received at least a satisfactory rating on such institutions most recent examination under the cra the bhc itself must also be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged in order to be eligible to elect fhc status if an fhc fails to continue to be wellcapitalized or wellmanaged after engaging in activities not permissible for bhcs that have not elected to be treated as financial holding companies the company must enter into an agreement with the federal reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements if the company does not return to compliance within days the federal reserve may order the company to divest its subsidiary banks or the company may be required to discontinue or divest investments in companies engaged in activities permissible only for a bhc electing to be treated as an fhc furthermore if the federal reserve determines that an fhc has not maintained a cra rating of at least satisfactory the fhc would not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities although the fhc would still be allowed to engage in activities closely related to banking and make investments in the ordinary course of conducting banking activities the bhc act does not place territorial restrictions on permissible nonbanking activities of bhcs the federal reserve has the power to order any bhc or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the federal reserve has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bhc capital requirements regions and regions bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve which are based on the basel iii framework the basel iiibased us capital rules among other things include both riskbased requirements which compare three measures of capital to rwas as well as leverage requirements which in the case of category iv bhcs such as regions consist of the tier leverage ratio described below under the us basel iiibased capital rules the minimum capital ratios are cet1 capital to rwas tier capital that is cet1 capital plus additional tier capital to rwas total capital that is tier capital plus tier capital to rwas and tier capital to total average consolidated assets the leverage ratio the capital rules also require firms to maintain a buffer consisting of solely cet1 capital in addition to the minimum riskbased requirements failure to satisfy the buffer requirement in full results in graduated constraints on capital distributions and discretionary executive compensation the extent to which capital distributions will be constrained depends on the amount of the shortfall and the institutions eligible retained income which is defined as the greater of a banking institutions net income for the four preceding calendar quarters net of any distributions to shareholders and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income and the average of a banking institutions net income over the preceding four quarters as a category iv bhc regions scb is determined through the frbs ccar supervisory stress tests the scb reflects stressed losses in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the ccar stress tests and includes four quarters of planned common stock dividends the scb is

total assets such as regions bank and provides details regarding the content that filers will be expected to prepare prior to each plan submission cycle the fdic will notify each bank of the timing of its next submission which will be at least months after the date of that communication regions bank was notified in august that it will be required to submit the next resolution plan on or before december safety and soundness standards the fdia requires the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements the fdia establishes five capital categories wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized and the federal banking agencies must take certain mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized the severity of these mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed generally subject to a narrow exception the fdia requires the banking regulator to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized as of december both regions and regions bank were wellcapitalized an institution that is classified as wellcapitalized based on its capital levels may be treated as adequately capitalized and an institution that is adequately capitalized or undercapitalized based upon its capital levels may be treated as though it were undercapitalized or significantly undercapitalized respectively if the appropriate federal banking agency after notice and opportunity for hearing determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment an institution that is categorized as undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking regulator under the fdia in order for the capital restoration plan to be accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency a bhc must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution will comply with its capital restoration plan subject to certain limitations the bhc must also provide appropriate assurances of performance the fdia requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain noncapital standards for safety and soundness relating generally to operations and management asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards regulators also must take into consideration i concentrations of credit risk ii interest rate risk when the interest rate sensitivity of an institutions assets does not match the sensitivity of its liabilities or its offbalance sheet position and iii risks from nontraditional activities as well as an institutions ability to manage those risks when determining the adequacy of an institutions capital regulators make this evaluation as a part of their regular examination of the institutions safety and soundness additionally regulators may choose to examine other factors in order to evaluate the safety and soundness of financial institutions payment of dividends we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banking and other subsidiaries the principal source of cash flow to us including cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest on any of our outstanding debt is dividends from regions bank there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by regions bank to us as well as by us to our shareholders if in the opinion of a federal bank regulatory agency an institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice such agency may require after notice and hearing that such institution cease and desist from such practice the federal bank regulatory agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete an institutions capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice under the fdia an insured institution may not pay a dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized see safety and soundness standards above moreover the federal reserve and the fdic have issued policy statements stating that bhcs and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings payment of dividends by regions bank under the federal reserves regulation h regions bank may not without approval of the federal reserve declare or pay a dividend to regions if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year exceeds the total of a regions banks net income for that year and b its retained net income for the preceding two calendar years less any required transfers to additional paidin capital or to a fund for the retirement of preferred stock under alabama law regions bank may not pay a dividend in excess of of its net earnings unless its surplus is equal to at least of capital regions bank is also required by alabama law to seek the approval of the alabama superintendent of banking prior to the payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by regions bank in any calendar year will exceed the total of a regions banks net earnings for that year plus b its retained net earnings for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus the statute defines net earnings as the remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and other assets after deducting from the total thereof all current operating expenses actual losses accrued dividends on preferred stock if any and all federal state and local taxes regions bank cannot without approval from the federal reserve and the alabama superintendent of banking declare or pay a dividend to regions unless regions bank is able to satisfy the criteria discussed above payment of dividends by regions our payment of dividends to our shareholders is subject to the oversight of the federal reserve in particular the dividend policies and share repurchases of a large bhc such as regions are reviewed by the federal reserve based on capital plans submitted as part of the ccar process and stress tests as submitted by the bhc see capital requirements and comprehensive capital analysis and review and stress testing above support of subsidiary banks under longstanding federal reserve policy which has been codified by the doddfrank act regions is expected to act as a source of financial strength to and to commit resources to support its subsidiary bank this support may be required at times when regions may not be inclined to provide it in addition any capital loans by a bhc to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank in the event of a bhcs bankruptcy any commitment by the bhc to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment transactions with affiliates sections and of the federal reserve act and the federal reserves regulation w restrict transactions between a bank and its affiliates including a parent bhc regions bank is subject to these restrictions which include quantitative and qualitative limits on the amounts and types of transactions that may take place including extensions of credit to affiliates investments in the stock or securities of affiliates purchases of assets from affiliates and certain other transactions with affiliates these restrictions also require that credit transactions with affiliates be collateralized and that transactions with affiliates be on market terms or better for the bank generally a banks covered transactions with any affiliate are limited to of the banks capital stock and surplus and covered transactions with all affiliates are limited to of the banks capital stock and surplus deposit insurance regions bank accepts deposits and those deposits have the benefit of fdic insurance up to the applicable limits under the fdia insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the insured depository institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by a banks federal regulatory agency regions bank pays deposit insurance premiums to the fdic based on an assessment rate established by the fdic fdic assessment rates for large institutions with more than billion in assets such as regions bank are calculated based on a scorecard methodology that seeks to capture both the probability that an individual large institution will fail and the magnitude of the impact on the deposit insurance fund if such a failure occurs the calculation is based primarily on the institutions assessment base which is primarily the difference between average total assets and average tangible equity multiplied by the institutions assessment rate which is derived from various riskbased scorecard measures the fdic has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score up or down based upon significant risk factors that may not be adequately captured in the scorecard for large institutions including regions bank after accounting for potential baserate adjustments the total base assessment rate that is applied to an institutions calculated assessment base could range from to basis points on an annualized basis for more information see the fdic insurance assessments section of item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k acquisitions the bhc act requires every bhc to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before i it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or savings and loan association if after such acquisition the bhc will directly or indirectly own or control or more of the voting shares of the institution ii it or any of its subsidiaries other than a bank may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings and loan association or iii it may merge or consolidate with any other bhc fhcs must obtain prior approval from the federal reserve before acquiring certain nonbank financial companies with assets exceeding billion fhcs seeking approval to complete an acquisition must be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged the bhc act further provides that the federal reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the us or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served the federal reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bhcs and banks impacted and the convenience and needs of the community to be served consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy and the consideration of convenience and needs of the community to be served includes the parties performance under the cra the federal reserve must also take into account the institutions effectiveness in combating money laundering in addition pursuant to the doddfrank act the bhc act was amended to require the federal reserve to when evaluating a proposed transaction consider the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the us banking or financial system in july the biden administration issued an executive order on competition which included provisions relating to bank mergers these provisions encourage the department of justice and the federal banking regulators to update guidelines on banking mergers and to provide more scrutiny of bank mergers a number of large bank mergers that were pending at the time of the executive order have not yet obtained approval despite them being filed earlier in or only obtained approval after extended periods of time depositor preference under federal law claims of depositors and certain claims for both administrative expenses and employee compensation against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver volcker rule the doddfrank act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in sponsoring and having certain relationships with private funds such as hedge funds or private equity funds that would be considered an investment company for purposes of the volcker rule the compliance requirements under regulations implementing the volcker rule are tailored based on the size and scope of trading activities the final rules implementing the volcker rule also require that large bhcs such as regions design and implement compliance programs to ensure adherence to the volcker rules prohibitions consumer protection laws we are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws including laws designed to protect customers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population these laws include but are not limited to the equal credit opportunity act the fair credit reporting act the truth in lending act the home mortgage disclosure act the real estate settlement procedures act the truth in savings act the electronic funds transfer act and their respective state law counterparts the cfpb has broad rulemaking supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws including the laws referenced above other fair lending laws and certain other statutes the cfpb also has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to consumer financial laws for depository institutions with billion or more in assets including the authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products financial privacy and cybersecurity the federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to third parties these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties in addition consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service such as that shown on consumer credit reports and application information consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services federal law requires financial institutions to implement a written information security program that includes administrative technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities the program should be designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information protect against unanticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer financial institutions must also conduct ongoing oversight of third party service providers to ensure they are maintaining appropriate security controls financial institutions must report on the institutions cybersecurity program annually to the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors the federal banking regulators regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity intended to enhance cyber risk management standards among financial institutions a financial institution is expected to establish multiple lines of defense against security threats and to ensure their risk management processes appropriately address the risk posed by potential threats to the institution a financial institutions management is expected to maintain sufficient processes to effectively respond and recover the institutions operations after a cyberattack a financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations if a critical service provider of the institution falls victim to this type of cyberattack the regions information security program reflects the requirements of these regulatory requirements and guidance in addition on november the federal banking regulators imposed a new cybersecurityrelated notification rule that would require banking organizations including regions and regions bank to notify their primary federal regulator as soon as possible and within hours of incidents that have materially disrupted or degraded or are reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade the banking organizations ability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base jeopardize the viability of key operations of the banking organization or impact the stability of the financial sector the rule also imposes requirements on bank service providers to notify their affected banking organization customers of certain computersecurity incidents this rule will become effective on april 2022with compliance required by may state regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations recently several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs and providing detailed requirements with respect to these programs including data encryption requirements many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements for example the california consumer privacy act became effective on january and in november california voters approved the california privacy rights act which will take effect on january comprehensive state privacy laws approved in will also take effect in colorado and virginia in we expect this trend of statelevel activity in those areas to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which our customers are located community reinvestment act regions bank is subject to the provisions of the cra under the terms of the cra regions bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its communities including providing credit to individuals residing in low and moderateincome neighborhoods the cra requires each appropriate federal bank regulatory agency in connection with its examination of a depository institution to assess such institutions record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of the community served by that institution including low and moderateincome neighborhoods the regulatory agencys assessment is part of the federal reserves consideration of applications by a bank or bhc to acquire merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company to establish a new branch office that will accept deposits or to relocate an office in the case of a bhc applicant the federal reserve will assess the records of each subsidiary depository institution of the applicant bhc and such records may be the basis for denying the application in april the us department of treasury issued a memorandum to the federal banking regulators with recommended changes to the cras implementing regulations to reduce their complexity and associated burden on banks subsequently in december the occ and fdic issued a notice of proposed rulemaking intended to update and modernize the cras implementing regulations on may the occ finalized its rule while the fdic which had joined the occs proposed rulemaking did not proceed with a final rule the federal reserve which did not join the occ and fdics proposal in october put forth its own advance notice of proposed rulemaking focused on cra modernization on december the occ issued a final rule to rescind its may rule and will join the federal reserve and the fdic in a joint cra proposal which will provide more consistency across all insured depository institutions we will continue to evaluate the impact of any changes to the regulations implementing the cra regions banks most recent cra rating from the federal reserve is satisfactory compensation practices our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the federal reserve the federal banking regulators have provided guidance designed to ensure that incentive compensation arrangements at banking organizations take into account risk and are consistent with safe and sound practices the guidance sets forth the following three key principles with respect to incentive compensation arrangements i the arrangements should provide employees with incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ii the arrangements should be compatible with effective controls and risk management and iii the arrangements should be supported by strong corporate governance the guidance provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated as appropriate into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions the guidance also provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness antimoney laundering a continued focus of governmental policy relating to financial institutions in recent years has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing the usa patriot act broadened the application of antimoney laundering regulations to apply to additional types of financial institutions such as brokerdealers investment advisors and insurance companies and strengthened the ability of the us government to help prevent detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism the principal provisions of title iii of the usa patriot act require that regulated financial institutions including state member banks i establish an antimoney laundering program that includes training and audit components ii comply with regulations regarding the verification of the identity of any person seeking to open an account iii take additional required precautions with nonus owned accounts and iv perform certain verification and certification of money laundering risk for their foreign correspondent banking relationships failure of a financial institution to comply with the usa patriot acts requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution regions banking subsidiary has augmented its systems and procedures to meet the requirements of these regulations and will continue to revise and update their policies procedures and controls to reflect changes required by the usa patriot act and implementing regulations the usa patriot act also requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition in january the amla which amends the bsa was enacted among other things the amla codifies a riskbased approach to antimoney laundering compliance for financial institutions requires the development of standards by the us department of the treasury for evaluating technology and internal processes for bsa compliance and expands enforcement and investigationrelated authority including a significant expansion in the available sanctions for certain bsa violations many of the statutory provisions in the amla will require additional rulemaking reports and other measures and the impact of the amla will depend on among other things rulemaking and implementation guidance in june fincen which drafts regulations implementing the usa patriot act and other antimoney laundering and bank secrecy act legislation issued the priorities for antimoney laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy required under amla the priorities include corruption cybercrime terrorist financing fraud transnational crime drug trafficking human trafficking and proliferation financing bank regulators are focusing their examinations on antimoney laundering compliance and we continue to monitor and augment where necessary our antimoney laundering compliance programs office of foreign assets control regulation the us has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others these are typically known as the ofac rules based on their administration by the us treasury department office of foreign assets control the ofacadministered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms generally however they contain one or more of the following elements i restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on us persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in or providing investmentrelated advice or assistance to a sanctioned country and ii a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to us jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of us persons blocked assets eg property and bank deposits cannot be paid out withdrawn set off or transferred in any manner without a license from ofac failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences regulation of broker dealers and investment advisers our subsidiaries regions securities llc and blackarch securities llc are registered brokerdealers with the sec and finra and regions investment management inc and highland associates inc are registered investment advisers with the sec these subsidiaries are as a result subject to regulation and examination by the sec finra and other selfregulatory organizations these regulations cover a broad range of issues including capital requirements sales and trading practices use of client funds and securities the conduct of directors officers and employees recordkeeping and recording supervisory procedures to prevent improper trading on material nonpublic information qualification and licensing of sales personnel and limitations on the extension of credit in securities transactions in addition to federal registration state securities commissions require the registration of certain brokerdealers and investment advisers competition all aspects of our business are highly competitive our subsidiaries compete with other financial institutions located in the states in which they operate and other adjoining states as well as large banks in major financial centers and other financial intermediaries such as savings and loan associations credit unions internet banks finance companies mutual funds insurance companies brokerage and investment banking firms mortgage companies and financial service operations of major commercial and retail corporations we expect competition to remain intense among financial services companies given the low interest rate and slower economic environment also future changes in monetary policy coupled with postcrisis regulatory requirements may increase competition for certain deposit products our success will depend in part on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services further we expect consolidation in the financial services industry to continue which may produce larger bettercapitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer traditional bank or banklike products and services and therefore compete with financial institutions like us in providing electronic internetbased and mobile phonebased financial solutions in particular the activity of fintechs has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue to grow a number of fintechs have applied for and in some cases been granted bank or industrial loan charters while other fintechs have partnered with existing banks to allow them to offer deposit products to their customers in addition to fintechs traditional technology companies have begun to make efforts toward providing financial services directly to their customers although providing digital products and services has been important to serving customers and competing in the financial services industry for some time the covid19 pandemic further accelerated the move towards digital banking and financial services and we expect a banks digital offerings to be a key competitive differentiator the continued move toward digital banking and financial services combined with customer expectations regarding digital offerings will require us to invest greater resources in technological improvements customers for banking services and other financial services offered by our subsidiaries are generally influenced by convenience quality of service price of service personal contacts the quality of the technology that supports the customer experience and availability of products although our position varies in different markets we believe that our affiliates effectively compete with other financial services companies in their relevant market areas human capital one pillar of our strategic priorities at regions is the commitment to build the best team we believe one of the biggest differentiators of our performance is the people we employ the need to attract retain and develop the right talent to accomplish our strategic plan is central to our success as of december regions and its subsidiaries had fulltime equivalent employees supporting our consumer and commercial banking wealth management and mortgage product and services primarily across the southeast and midwest approximately associates were added in the fourth quarter of from acquisitions closed during the quarter our associate team reflects the diversity of the communities we serve as of december approximately percent of our associates were women and approximately percent selfidentified as a part of a minority demographic because diversity equity and inclusion are fundamental to our human capital strategy we believe it is important for our stakeholders to understand our progress and therefore we provided additional transparency into our workforce demographics by disclosing eeo1 results on our workforce demographics report available in our online esg resource center a strong and impactful human capital program begins at the top our board oversees our corporate strategy and sets the tone for our culture values and high ethical standards and through its committees holds management accountable for results beginning in the board expanded the scope of our chr committee
