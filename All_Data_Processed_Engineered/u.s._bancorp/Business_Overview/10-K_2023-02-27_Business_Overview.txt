guaranty liability is equal to the estimated loss to the dif for the resolution of the affiliated institutions in default the fdics claim under the cross guaranty provision is superior to claims of shareholders of the insured depository institution or its bhc and to most claims arising out of obligations or liabilities owed to affiliates of the institution but is subordinate to claims of depositors secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt other than affiliates of the commonly controlled insured depository institution the fdic may decline to enforce the cross guaranty provision if it determines that a waiver is in the best interest of the dif occ heightened standards usbna and mub are each subject to the occs guidelines establishing heightened standards for large national banks which establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks the occ may take action against institutions that fail to meet these standards enhanced prudential standards under the doddfrank act as modified by the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act and the tailoring rules large bank holding companies

from its subsidiaries typically the majority of the companys operating funds are received in the form of dividends paid to the company by usbna and mub federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks in general dividends payable by usbna mub and the companys trust bank subsidiaries as national banking associations are limited by rules that compare dividends to net income for periods defined by regulation the occ the federal reserve and the fdic also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including the company usbna and mub if in the banking regulators opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization in addition the federal reserves final rule implementing the stress capital buffer scb provides that a bhc must receive prior approval for any dividend stock repurchase or other capital distribution other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument if the bhc is required to resubmit its capital plan the rule also provides that a bhc must resubmit its capital plan

capital requirements the company is subject to certain regulatory riskbased capital and leverage requirements under capital rules adopted by the federal reserve and usbna and mub are each subject to substantially similar rules adopted by the occ these rules implement the basel committees framework for strengthening the regulation supervision and risk management of banks basel iii as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act these quantitative calculations are minimums and the federal reserve and occ may determine that a banking organization based on its size complexity or risk profile must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner under the tailoring rules the company usbna and mub are each currently subject to category iii standards and are standardized approach banking organizations that are subject to rules that provide for simplified capital requirements relating to the threshold deductions for mortgage servicing assets deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that a banking organization could not realize through net operating loss carry backs and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions as well as the inclusion of minority interests in regulatory capital growth in total consolidated assets including assets obtained in acquisitions or crossjurisdictional activity as defined in the tailoring rules or action by the federal reserve in connection with the federal reserve commitments could affect the companys continued classification as a category iii institution which could result in the company and its insured depository institution subsidiaries becoming advanced approaches banking organizations a requirement to recognize elements of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital as well as other more stringent capital liquidity and other regulatory requirements under the united states basel iiibased capital rules the company is subject to a minimum common equity tier cet1 capital ratio cet1 capital to riskweighted assets of percent a minimum tier capital ratio of percent and a minimum total capital ratio of percent the company is also subject to the scb which is based on the results of the federal reserves supervisory stress tests and the companys planned common stock dividends and if deployed by the federal reserve up to a percent common equity tier countercyclical capital buffer these additional requirements must be satisfied entirely with capital that qualifies as cet1 although the federal reserve has not to date raised the countercyclical capital buffer above zero percent the countercyclical capital buffer could change in the future the scb generally is assigned on an annual basis and becomes effective on october of each year subject to a percent floor and may vary over time as of december the scb applicable to the company is percent if the federal reserve were to raise the countercyclical capital buffer or if the scb applicable to the company were to exceed percent this would also change the effective minimum capital ratios to which the company is subject for usbna the buffer requirement consists of the static capital conservation buffer equal to of riskweighted assets banking organizations that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation with the severity of the constraints depending on the extent of the shortfall and eligible retained income defined as the greater of i net income for the four preceding quarters net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income and ii the average of all net income over the preceding four quarters united states banking organizations are also subject to a minimum tier leverage ratio of percent as a category iii banking organization the company is also subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio slr of percent that takes into account both onbalance sheet and certain offbalance sheet exposures at december the company exceeded the applicable minimum tier leverage ratio and slr requirements in december the basel committee finalized a package of revisions to the basel iii framework the changes are meant to improve the calculation of riskweighted assets including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain unconditionally cancellable commitments including unused lines of credit and improve the comparability of capital ratios by i enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk credit valuation adjustment cva risk and operational risk ii constraining the use of the internal model approaches by placing limits on certain inputs used to calculate capital requirements under the internal ratingsbased irb approach for credit risk and by removing the use of the internal model approaches for cva risk and for operational risk iii introducing a leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemically important banks and iv replacing the existing basel ii output floor with a more robust risksensitive floor based on the committees revised basel iii standardized approaches in addition in january the basel committee published a revised market risk framework that among other things revises the standardized approach for market risk the basel framework contemplated that these standards generally would be effective on january with an aggregate output floor phasing in through january the federal bank regulators have not yet proposed rules implementing these standards and accordingly the standards are not yet in effect for united states banking organizations the effects of these revisions on the company and usbna will depend on the manner in which they are implemented by the united states federal banking agencies in the united states federal banking agencies adopted a rule that allowed banking organizations including the company and usbna to elect to delay temporarily the estimated effects of adopting the current expected credit loss accounting standard cecl on regulatory capital until january and subsequently to phase in the effects through january through the stress test cycle the federal reserve has not yet incorporated cecl into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses in supervisory stress tests for further discussion of cecl see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements in

subject to category iii standards such as the company to conduct an annual internal stress test in connection with its annual capital plan submission as well as biennial companyrun stress tests and subject such bhcs to annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve among other things the companyrun stress tests employ stress scenarios developed by the company as well as stress scenarios provided by the federal reserve and incorporate the doddfrank act capital actions as opposed to the companys planned capital actions which are intended to normalize capital distributions across large united states bank holding companies the federal reserve conducts ccar and doddfrank act supervisory stress tests employing stress scenarios and internal supervisory models and incorporates the companys planned capital actions and the doddfrank act capital actions respectively into its stress tests the federal reserve and the company are currently required to publish the results of the annual supervisory and biennial companyrun stress tests respectively no later than june of each applicable year if the company were to become a category ii institution for purposes of the tailoring rules whether as a result of growth in total consolidated assets including assets obtained in acquisitions or crossjurisdictional activity as defined in the tailoring rules or action by

well as daily rather than monthly liquidity reporting requirements prompt corrective action the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates including parent holding companies by federal banking regulators as part of that framework the fdicia requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to an fdicinsured depository institution such as usbna or mub if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the prompt corrective action rules generally depend upon an institutions classification within five capital categories an institution that fails to remain wellcapitalized becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions restrictions on asset growth or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications the fdicia also provides for enhanced supervisory authority over undercapitalized institutions including authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution prompt corrective action regulations apply only to banks and not to bhcs such as the company however the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action at the bhc level based on the undercapitalized status of the bhcs subsidiary banking institutions in certain instances relating to an undercapitalized bank the bhc would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiarys capital restoration plan and could be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill those guarantee commitments deposit insurance the dif provides insurance coverage for certain deposits up to a standard maximum deposit insurance amount of per depositor deposits at usbna and mub are insured up to

rule to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules for all insured depository institutions by two basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of the increased assessment rate is intended to improve the likelihood that the dif reserve ratio would reach the required minimum of percent by the statutory deadline of september depositor preference under federal law in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of a receiver of the institution for administrative expense and the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities have priority over the claims of other unsecured creditors of the institution including holders of publicly issued senior or subordinated debt and depositors in nondomestic offices as a result those debtholders and depositors would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors in domestic offices of the depository institution orderly liquidation authority upon the insolvency of a bhc such as the company the fdic may be appointed as conservator or receiver of the bhc if the secretary of the treasury determines upon the written recommendation of the fdic and the federal reserve and after consultation with the president of the united states that certain conditions set forth in the doddfrank act regarding the potential impact on financial stability of a financial companys failure have been met fdic rules set forth a comprehensive method for the receivership of a covered financial company

the federal reserve and the fdic to submit a periodic plan for the rapid and orderly resolution of the company and its significant legal entities in the event of future material financial distress or failure if the federal reserve and the fdic jointly determine that the resolution plan is not credible and such deficiencies are not cured in a timely manner the regulators may jointly impose on the company more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on the companys growth activities or operations if the company were to fail to address the deficiencies in its

finalizing the guidance the company expects to be subject to the final guidance in addition usbna and mub are required to file periodically separate resolution plans with the fdic that should enable the fdic as receiver to resolve each institution under applicable receivership provisions of the federal deposit insurance act in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured
