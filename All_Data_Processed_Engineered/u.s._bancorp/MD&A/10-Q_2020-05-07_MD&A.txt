an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company the companys board of directors has approved a risk management framework which establishes governance and risk management requirements for all risktaking activities this framework includes company and business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing business objectives and initiatives the board of directors primarily through its risk management committee oversees performance relative to the risk management framework risk appetite statements and other policy requirements the executive risk committee erc which is chaired by the chief risk officer and includes the chief executive officer and other members of the executive management team oversees execution against the risk management framework and risk appetite statements the erc focuses on current and emerging risks including strategic and reputation risks by directing timely and comprehensive actions senior operating committees have also been established each responsible for overseeing a specified category of risk us bancorp the companys most prominent risk exposures are credit interest rate market liquidity operational compliance strategic and reputation leveraging the companys risk management framework covid19 specific impacts and related risks are identified for each of the most prominent exposures oversight and governance is managed through a centralized command center which escalates through the erc the board of directors also oversees the companys responsiveness to the covid19 pandemic credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest andor the principal balance of a loan investment or derivative contract when it is due interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income or market valuations as a result of changes in interest rates market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates foreign exchange rates and security prices that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments such as trading and availableforsale securities mortgage loans held for sale mlhfs msrs and derivatives that are accounted for on a fair value basis liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations or new business at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems people or adverse external events including the risk of loss resulting from breaches in data security operational risk can also include the risk of loss due to failures by third parties with which the company does business compliance risk is the risk that the company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions material financial loss or loss to reputation through failure to comply with laws regulations rules standards of good practice and codes of conduct strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition arising from adverse business decisions poor implementation of business decisions or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings capital or franchise or enterprise value arising from negative public opinion this risk may impair the companys competitiveness by affecting its ability to establish new customer relationships offer new services or continue serving existing customer relationships in addition to the risks identified above other risk factors exist that may impact the company refer to risk factors in this report and in the companys annual report on s as well as the potential impact on customers and the domestic economy resulting from new tariffs or increases in existing tariffs and the covid19 pandemic the risk management committee oversees the companys credit risk management process in addition credit quality ratings as defined by the company are an important part of the companys overall credit risk management and evaluation of its allowance for credit losses loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on the companys rating scale for problem credits as minimal risk has been identified loans with a special mention or classified rating including loans that are days or more past due and still accruing nonaccrual loans those loans considered troubled debt restructurings tdrs and loans in a junior lien position that are current but are behind a modified or delinquent loan in a first lien position encompass all loans held by the company that it considers to have a potential or welldefined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk the companys internal credit quality ratings for consumer loans are primarily based on delinquency and nonperforming status except for a limited population of larger loans within those portfolios that are individually evaluated for this limited population the determination of the internal credit quality rating may also consider collateral value and customer cash flows refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys loan portfolios including internal credit quality ratings in addition refer to managements discussion and analysis credit risk management in the companys annual report on form 10k for the year ended december for a more detailed discussion on credit risk management processes the company manages its credit risk in part through diversification of its loan portfolio which is achieved through limit setting by product type criteria such as industry and identification of credit concentrations as part of its normal business activities the company offers a broad array of lending products the company categorizes its loan portfolio into two segments which is the level at which it develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses the companys two loan portfolio segments are commercial lending and consumer lending the commercial lending segment includes loans and leases made to small business middle market large corporate commercial real estate financial institution nonprofit and public sector customers key risk characteristics relevant to commercial lending segment loans include the industry and geography of the borrowers business purpose of the loan repayment source borrowers debt capacity and financial flexibility loan covenants and nature of pledged collateral if any these risk characteristics among others are considered in determining estimates about the likelihood of default by the borrowers and the severity of loss in the event of default the company considers these risk characteristics in assigning internal risk ratings to or forecasting losses on these loans which are the significant factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for loans in the commercial lending segment the consumer lending segment represents loans and leases made to consumer customers including residential mortgages credit card loans and other retail loans such as revolving consumer lines auto loans and leases home equity loans and lines and student loans a runoff portfolio home equity or second mortgage loans are junior lien closedend accounts fully disbursed at origination these loans typically are fixed rate loans secured by residential real estate with a or 15year fixed payment amortization schedule home equity lines are revolving accounts giving the borrower the ability to draw and repay balances repeatedly up to a maximum commitment and are secured by residential real estate these include accounts in either a first or junior lien position typical terms on home equity lines in the portfolio are variable rates benchmarked to the prime rate with a or 15year draw period during which a minimum payment is equivalent to the monthly interest followed by a or 10year amortization period respectively at march substantially all of the companys home equity lines were in the draw period approximately billion or percent of the outstanding home equity line balances at march will enter the amortization period within the next months key risk characteristics relevant to consumer lending segment loans primarily relate to the borrowers capacity and willingness to repay and include unemployment rates and other economic factors customer payment history and credit scores and in some cases updated loantovalue ltv information us bancorp reflecting current market conditions on real estatebased loans these risk characteristics among others including elevated risk resulting from the covid19 pandemic are reflected in forecasts of delinquency levels bankruptcies and losses which are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for the consumer lending segment the company further disaggregates its loan portfolio segments into various classes based on their underlying risk characteristics the two classes within the commercial lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans the three classes within the consumer lending segment are residential mortgages credit card loans and other retail loans the companys consumer lending segment utilizes several distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer credit including traditional branch lending mobile and online banking indirect lending correspondent banks and loan brokers each distinct underwriting and origination activity manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its loan production commensurate with the differing risk profiles residential mortgage originations are generally limited to prime borrowers and are performed through the companys branches loan production offices mobile and online services and a wholesale network of originators the company may retain residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance sheet or sell the loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights and customer relationships utilizing the secondary markets enables the company to effectively reduce its credit and other assetliability risks for residential mortgages that are retained in the companys portfolio and for home equity and second mortgages credit risk is also diversified by geography and managed by adherence to ltv and borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process the company estimates updated ltv information on its outstanding residential mortgages quarterly based on a method that combines automated valuation model updates and relevant home price indices ltv is the ratio of the loans outstanding principal balance to the current estimate of property value for home equity and second mortgages combined loantovalue cltv is the combination of the first mortgage original principal balance and the second lien outstanding principal balance relative to the current estimate of property value certain loans do not have an ltv or cltv primarily due to lack of availability of relevant automated valuation model andor home price indices values or lack of necessary valuation data

loans in certain circumstances the company may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the nearterm in most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in interest rate extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance that would otherwise not be considered troubled debt restructurings concessionary modifications are classified as tdrs unless the modification results in only an insignificant delay in the payments to be

may also work with the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate losses such as obtaining additional collateral andor guarantees to support the loan the company has also implemented certain residential mortgage loan restructuring programs that may result in tdrs the company modifies residential mortgage loans under federal housing administration united states department of veterans affairs and its own internal programs under these programs the company offers qualifying homeowners the opportunity to permanently modify their loan and achieve more affordable monthly payments by providing loan concessions these concessions may include adjustments to interest rates conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates extensions of maturity dates or deferrals of payments capitalization of accrued interest andor outstanding advances or in limited situations partial forgiveness of loan principal in most instances participation in residential mortgage loan restructuring programs requires the customer to complete a shortterm trial period a permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer successfully completing the trial period us bancorp arrangement and the loan documents are not modified until that time the company reports loans in a trial period arrangement as tdrs and continues to report them as tdrs after the trial period credit card and other retail loan tdrs are generally part of distinct restructuring programs providing customers modification solutions over a specified time period generally up to months in accordance with regulatory guidance

including those modifications resulting directly from the covid19 pandemic consumer lending programs include payment reductions deferrals of up to three past due payments and the ability to return to current status if the borrower makes required payments the company may also make shortterm modifications to commercial lending loans with the most common modification being an extension of the

net chargeoffs the increase in retail leasing chargeoffs reflected the inclusion of end of term losses on residual lease values as of january the company expects net chargeoffs to increase given current economic conditions analysis and determination of the allowance for credit losses prior to january the allowance for credit losses was established to reserve for probable and estimable losses incurred in the companys loan and lease portfolio including unfunded credit commitments effective january the company adopted new accounting guidance which changed previous impairment recognition to a model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses the allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net chargeoffs inclusive of expected recoveries management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis the allowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives of the applicable assets multiple economic scenarios are considered over a threeyear reasonable and supportable forecast period which incorporates historical loss experience in years two and three after the forecast period the company fully reverts to longterm historical loss experience adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and lease portfolio to estimate losses over the remaining lives the economic scenarios are updated at least quarterly and are designed to provide a range of reasonable estimates both better and worse than current expectations scenarios are weighted based on the companys expectation of future conditions final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses not reflected in the scenarios due to the unique aspects of current conditions and expectations these factors may include loan servicing practices regulatory guidance andor fiscal and monetary policy actions because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans the company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments which is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are included in the companys analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios the allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forwardlooking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors affecting lifetime credit losses these factors include loan and borrower characteristics such as internal risk ratings on commercial loans and consumer credit scores delinquency status collateral type and available valuation information consideration of endofterm losses on lease residuals and the remaining term of the loan adjusted for expected prepayments where loans do not exhibit similar risk characteristics an individual analysis is performed to consider expected credit losses for each loan portfolio model estimates are adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition lending policies underwriting standards risk management practices or economic conditions that would affect the accuracy of the model us bancorp the results of the analysis are evaluated quarterly to confirm the estimates are appropriate for each loan portfolio expected credit loss estimates also include consideration of expected cash recoveries on loans previously chargedoff or expected recoveries on collateral dependent loans where recovery is expected through sale of the collateral the allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans greater than million in the commercial lending segment is based on an analysis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral less selling costs for collateraldependent loans the allowance recorded for tdr loans in the consumer lending segment is determined on a homogenous pool basis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate of the pool the allowance for collateraldependent loans in the consumer lending segment is determined based on the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell and any expected future writeoffs or recoveries the allowance for credit losses on consumer lending segment tdr loans includes the consideration of subsequent payment defaults since modification the borrowers ability to pay under the restructured terms and the timing and amount of payments when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position the company considers the delinquency and modification status of the first lien at march the company serviced the first lien on percent of the home equity loans and lines in a junior lien position the company also considers the status of first lien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files when the first lien is not serviced by the company regardless of whether the company services the first lien an assessment is made of economic conditions problem loans recent loss experience and other factors in determining the allowance for credit losses based on the available information the company estimated million or percent of its total home equity portfolio at march represented nondelinquent junior liens where the first lien was delinquent or modified the company considers historical loss experience on the loans and lines in a junior lien position to establish loss estimates for junior lien loans and lines the company services that are current but the first lien is delinquent or modified historically the number of junior lien defaults has been a small percentage of the total portfolio approximately percent annually while the longterm average loss rate on loans that default has been approximately percent in addition the company obtains updated credit scores on its home equity portfolio each quarter and in some cases more frequently and uses this information in its loss estimation methods in its evaluation of the allowance for credit losses the company also considers the increased risk of loss associated with home equity lines that are contractually scheduled to convert from a revolving status to a fully amortizing payment and with residential lines and loans that have a balloon payoff provision beginning january when a loan portfolio is purchased the acquired loans are divided into those considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration pcd and those not considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration an allowance is established for each population and considers product mix risk characteristics of the portfolio bankruptcy experience delinquency status refreshed ltv ratios when possible and portfolio growth the allowance established for purchased loans not considered pcd is recognized through provision expense upon acquisition whereas the allowance established for loans considered pcd at acquisition is offset by an increase in the basis of the acquired loans any subsequent increases and decreases in the allowance related to purchased loans are recognized through provision expense with future chargeoffs charged to the allowance the company did not have a material amount of pcd loans included in its loan portfolio at march the companys methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses for each loan segment also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used as a result amounts determined under the methodologies described above are adjusted by management to consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors which include but are not limited to the following model imprecision imprecision in economic scenario assumptions and emerging risks related to either changes in the economic environment that are affecting specific portfolio segments or changes in portfolio concentrations over time that may affect model performance the consideration of these items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the companys allowance for credit losses for each portfolio class although the company determined the amount of each element of the allowance separately and considers this process to be an important credit management tool the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio the actual amount of losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts at march the allowance for credit losses was billion percent of periodend loans us bancorp compared with an allowance of billion percent of periodend loans at december the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was percent at march compared with percent at december the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to annualized loan net chargeoffs was percent at march compared with percent of full year net chargeoffs at december the increase in the allowance for credit losses of billion percent at march compared with december reflected the billion impact of the january adoption of new accounting guidance along with an additional million increase during the first quarter of due to deteriorating economic conditions driven by the impact of covid19 on the domestic and global economies expected loss estimates considered both the decrease in economic activity and the mitigating effects of government stimulus and industrywide loan modification efforts designed to limit longterm effects of the pandemic event changes in economic conditions as of march included steep declines in economic activity related to actions taken by governmental authorities to slow the spread of covid19 including stayathome orders record increases in unemployment claims and declining gross domestic product estimates for the first half of as well as contractions in manufacturing activity and oil prices were all observable changes in conditions that increased expected credit losses at the same time record economic stimulus measures were also enacted with the intent to support businesses and consumers through what is expected to be a temporary period of reduced activity to balance these offsetting factors economic scenarios updated through the end of the first quarter of that produced higher quantitative loss estimates consistent with the expected deterioration in reported economic statistics were evaluated in conjunction with managements expectation that current and potential future stimulus efforts as well as industrywide availability of shortterm payment deferral programs would mitigate losses estimated from models based on historical data from periods when mitigation efforts were not as extensive overall loss expectations are consistent with prior economic downturn experience but the severity of the deterioration in current economic conditions is not expected to persist over the life of the loan portfolio the allowance for credit losses related to commercial lending segment loans increased million at march compared with december as increased loan volume and credit downgrades during march reflected the immediate impact of covid19 on certain industry sectors including the travel lodging restaurants energy retail media and entertainment and automobile industries that were severely impacted by virus containment measures the allowance for credit losses related to consumer lending segment loans increased

earnings and the safety and soundness of an entity the company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by its asset liability management committee alco and approved by the board of directors the alco has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with the alco management policies including interest rate risk exposure one way the company measures and analyzes its interest rate risk is through net interest income simulation analysis simulation analysis incorporates substantially all of the companys assets and liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments together with forecasted changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment through this simulation management estimates the impact on net interest income of various interest rate changes that differ in the direction amount and speed of change over time as well as the shape of the yield curve this simulation includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to be affected by changes in loan and deposit growth assumptions are made to project interest rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis managements outlook and repricing strategies these assumptions are reviewed and validated on a periodic basis with sensitivity analysis being provided for key variables of the simulation the results are reviewed monthly by the alco and are used to guide assetliability management strategies the company manages its interest rate risk position by holding assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its balance sheet implementing certain pricing strategies for loans and deposits and selecting derivatives and various funding and investment portfolio strategies table summarizes the projected impact to net interest income over the next months of various potential interest rate changes the sensitivity of the projected impact to net interest income over the next months is dependent on balance sheet growth product mix deposit behavior pricing and funding decisions while the company utilizes assumptions based on historical information and expected behaviors actual outcomes could vary significantly for example if deposit outflows are more limited stable than the assumptions the company used in preparing table the projected impact to net interest income would be an increase of percent in the up bps and percent in the up bps scenarios us bancorp table sensitivity of net interest income march december down bps

scenario is not computed use of derivatives to manage interest rate and other risks to manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate prepayment credit price and foreign currency fluctuations asset and liability management positions the company enters into derivative transactions the company uses derivatives for asset and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways to convert fixedrate debt from fixedrate payments to floatingrate payments to convert the cash flows associated with floatingrate debt from floatingrate payments to fixedrate payments to mitigate changes in value of the companys unfunded mortgage loan commitments funded mlhfs and msrs to mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances and to mitigate the volatility of the companys net investment in foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition the company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its customers customerrelated positions the company minimizes the market and liquidity risks of customerrelated positions by either entering into similar offsetting positions with brokerdealers or on a portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or nonderivative financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from these customerrelated positions the company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchangetraded centrally cleared through clearinghouses or overthecounter the company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes the company does not designate all of the derivatives that it enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges because of the inefficiency of applying the accounting requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the related hedged items in particular the company enters into interest rate swaps swaptions forward commitments to buy tobeannounced securities tbas us treasury and eurodollar futures and options on us treasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value of its msrs but does not designate those derivatives as accounting hedges additionally the company uses forward commitments to sell tbas and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at specified prices to economically hedge the interest rate risk in its residential mortgage loan production activities at march the company had billion of forward commitments to sell hedging billion of mlhfs and billion of unfunded mortgage loan commitments the forward commitments to sell and the unfunded mortgage loan commitments on loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives under the accounting guidance related to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities the company has elected the fair value option for the mlhfs derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the contracts credit risk associated with derivatives is measured by the company based on the probability of counterparty default including consideration of the covid19 pandemic the company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties by entering into master netting arrangements and where possible by requiring collateral arrangements the company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to third parties through the use of risk participation agreements in addition certain interest rate swaps interest rate forwards and credit contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk for additional information on derivatives and hedging activities refer to

the london interbank offered rate libor after the company holds financial instruments that will be impacted by the discontinuance of libor including certain loans investment securities derivatives borrowings and other financial instruments that use libor as the benchmark rate the company also provides various services to customers in its capacity as trustee which involve financial instruments that will be similarly impacted by the discontinuance of libor the company anticipates these financial instruments will require transition to a new reference rate this transition us bancorp will occur over the next several years as many of these arrangements do not have an alternative rate referenced in their contracts or a clear path for the parties to agree upon an alternative reference rate in order to facilitate the transition process the company has instituted a libor transition office and commenced an enterprisewide project to identify assess and monitor risks associated with the expected discontinuance or unavailability of libor actively engage with industry working groups and regulators achieve operational readiness and engage impacted customers it is currently unclear what

market risk principally related to trading activities which support customers strategies to manage their own foreign currency interest rate risk and funding activities for purposes of its internal capital adequacy assessment process the company considers risk arising from its trading activities as well as the remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances included on its consolidated balance sheet collectively covered positions employing methodologies consistent with the requirements of regulatory rules for market risk the companys market risk committee mrc within the framework of the alco oversees market risk management the mrc monitors and reviews the companys covered positions and establishes policies for market risk management including exposure limits for each portfolio the company uses a var approach to measure general market risk theoretically var represents the statistical risk of loss the company has to adverse market movements over a oneday time horizon the company uses the historical simulation method to calculate var for its covered positions measured at the ninetyninth percentile using a oneyear lookback period for distributions derived from past market data the market factors used in the calculations include those pertinent to market risks inherent in the underlying trading portfolios principally those that affect the companys corporate bond trading business foreign currency transaction business client derivatives business loan trading business and municipal securities business as well as those inherent in the companys foreign denominated balances and the derivatives used to mitigate the related measurement volatility on average the company expects the oneday var to be exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year related to these positions the company monitors the accuracy of internal var models and modeling processes by backtesting model performance regularly updating the historical data used by the var models and regular model validations to assess the accuracy of the models input processing and reporting components all models are required to be independently reviewed and approved prior to being placed in use if the company were to experience market losses in excess of the estimated var more often than expected the var models and associated assumptions would be analyzed and adjusted the average high low and periodend oneday var amounts for the companys covered positions were as follows three months ended march  in millions average high low periodend given the recent market volatility the company experienced actual losses for its combined covered positions that exceeded var five times during the three months ended march the company did not experience any actual losses for its combined covered positions that exceeded var during the three months ended march the company stress tests its market risk measurements to provide management with perspectives on market events that may not be captured by its var models including worst case historical market movement combinations that have not necessarily occurred on the same date the company calculates stressed var using the same underlying methodology and model as var except that a historical continuous oneyear lookback period is utilized that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the companys covered positions the period selected by the company includes the significant market volatility of the last four months of the average high low and periodend oneday stressed var amounts for the companys covered positions were as follows three months ended march  in millions average high low periodend valuations of positions in client derivatives and foreign currency activities are based on discounted cash flow or other valuation techniques using marketbased us bancorp assumptions these valuations are compared to third party quotes or other market prices to determine if there are significant variances significant variances are approved by senior management in the companys corporate functions valuation of positions in the corporate bond trading loan trading and municipal securities businesses are based on trader marks these trader marks are evaluated against third party prices with significant variances approved by senior management in the companys corporate functions the company also measures the market risk of its hedging activities related to residential mlhfs and msrs using the historical simulation method the vars are measured at the ninetyninth percentile and employ factors pertinent to the market risks inherent in the valuation of the assets and hedges a oneyear lookback period is used to obtain past market data for the models the average high and low var

additional methods of evaluating the companys utilization of its capital held and the level of capital available to withstand unexpected negative market or economic conditions additionally presentation of these measures allows investors analysts and banking regulators to assess the companys capital position relative to other financial services companies these capital measures are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles gaap or are not currently effective or defined in banking regulations in addition certain of these measures differ from currently effective capital ratios defined by banking regulations principally in that the currently effective ratios which are subject to certain transitional provisions temporarily exclude the impact of the first quarter of

federal income tax rate of percent for those assets and liabilities whose income or expense is not included for federal income tax purposes critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions the companys financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions which are integral to understanding the companys financial statements critical accounting policies are those policies management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results and require management to make estimates that are difficult subjective or complex most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with the companys audit committee those policies considered to be critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for credit losses fair value estimates msrs and income taxes allowance for credit losses managements evaluation of the appropriate allowance for credit losses is often the most critical of all the accounting estimates for a banking institution it is an inherently subjective process impacted by many factors as discussed throughout the managements discussion and analysis section of this quarterly report on form 10q prior to january the allowance for credit losses was established to provide for probable and estimable losses incurred in the companys credit portfolio effective january the company adopted new accounting guidance which changed previous impairment recognition to a model that is based us bancorp on expected losses rather than incurred losses refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion on the effect of the adoption of this guidance on the companys financial statements the methods utilized to estimate the allowance for credit losses key assumptions and quantitative and qualitative information considered by management in determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses at march are discussed in the credit risk management section although methodologies utilized to determine each element of the allowance reflect managements assessment of credit risk as identified through assessments completed of individual credits and of homogenous pools affected by material credit events degrees of imprecision exist in these measurement tools due in part to subjective judgments involved and an inherent lag in the data available to quantify current conditions and events that affect credit loss reserve estimates as discussed in the analysis and determination of allowance for credit losses section management considered the effect of changes in economic conditions risk management practices and other factors that contributed to imprecision of loss estimates in determining the allowance for credit losses if not considered expected losses in the credit portfolio related to imprecision and other subjective factors could have a dramatic adverse impact on the liquidity and financial viability of a banking institution given the many quantitative variables and subjective factors affecting the credit portfolio changes in the allowance for credit losses may not directly coincide with changes in the risk ratings of the credit portfolio reflected in the risk rating process this is in part due to the timing of the risk rating process in relation to changes in the business cycle the exposure and mix of loans within risk rating categories levels of nonperforming loans and the timing of chargeoffs and expected recoveries the allowance for credit losses on commercial lending segment loans measures the expected loss content on the remaining portfolio exposure while nonperforming loans and net chargeoffs are measures of specific impairment events that have already been confirmed therefore the degree of change in the forwardlooking expected loss in the commercial lending allowance may differ from the level of changes in nonperforming loans and net chargeoffs management maintains an appropriate allowance for credit losses by updating allowance rates to reflect changes in expected losses including expected changes in economic or business cycle conditions some factors considered in determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses are more readily quantifiable while other factors require extensive qualitative judgment management conducts an analysis with respect to the accuracy of risk ratings and the volatility of expected losses and utilizes this analysis along with qualitative factors that can affect the precision of credit loss estimates including economic conditions such as changes in gross domestic product unemployment or bankruptcy rates and concentration risks such as risks associated with specific industries collateral valuations and loans to highly leveraged enterprises in determining the overall level of the allowance for credit losses the company considers a range of economic scenarios in its determination of the allowance for credit losses these scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses and also the expectation that conditions will eventually normalize over the longer run scenarios worse than the companys expected outcome at march include risks that government stimulus in response to the covid19 pandemic is less broad or less effective than expected or that a longer or more severe health crisis prolongs the downturn in economic activity reducing the number of businesses that are ultimately able to resume operations after the crisis has passed the companys determination of the allowance for commercial lending segment loans is sensitive to the assigned credit risk ratings and expected loss rates at march if percent of period ending loan balances including unfunded commitments within each risk category of risk rated commercial lending loans experienced a downgrade to the next worse risk category the allowance for credit losses would have increased by approximately million at march if quantitative loss estimates for commercial lending segment loans increased by percent the allowance for credit losses would have increased by approximately million at march the company believes the allowance for credit losses appropriately considers the imprecision in estimating credit losses based on credit risk ratings and credit loss model estimates but actual losses may differ from those estimates the companys determination of the allowance for consumer lending segment loans is sensitive to changes in estimated loss rates and estimated impairments on restructured loans in the event that estimated losses for this segment of the loan portfolio increased by percent the allowance for credit losses would have increased by approximately million at march because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the allowance for credit losses these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance for credit us bancorp losses they are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in risk rating and loss model estimates and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk rating or loss rates given current processes employed by the company management believes the risk ratings and loss model estimates currently assigned are appropriate it is possible that others given the same information may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions that could be significant to the companys financial statements refer to the analysis and determination of the allowance for credit losses section for further
