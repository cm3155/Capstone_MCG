partially offset by billion of bank note issuances refer to the liquidity risk management section for discussion of liquidity management of the company corporate risk profile overview managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company the companys board of directors has approved a risk management framework which establishes governance and risk management requirements for all risktaking activities this framework includes company and business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing business objectives and initiatives the board of directors primarily through its risk management committee oversees performance relative to the risk management framework risk appetite statements and other policy requirements the executive risk committee erc which is chaired by the chief risk officer and includes the chief executive officer and other members of the executive management team oversees execution against the risk management framework and risk appetite statements the erc focuses on current and emerging risks including strategic and reputation risks by directing timely and comprehensive actions senior operating committees have also been established each responsible for overseeing a specified category of risk the companys most prominent risk exposures are credit interest rate market liquidity operational compliance strategic and reputation leveraging the companys risk management framework the specific impacts of covid19 and related risks are identified for each of the most prominent exposures with respect to direct impacts from covid19 oversight and governance is managed through a centralized command center with frequent reporting to the managing committee and erc the board of directors also oversees the companys responsiveness to the covid19 pandemic credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a change in the credit profile or the failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its contractual obligations interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income or market valuations as a result of changes in interest rates market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates foreign exchange rates and security prices that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments such as trading and availableforsale securities mortgage loans held for sale mlhfs msrs and derivatives that are accounted for on a fair value basis liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations or new business at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner operational risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems people including human errors or misconduct or adverse external events including the risk of loss resulting from breaches in data security operational risk can also include the risk of loss due to failures by third parties with which the company does business compliance risk is the risk that the company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions financial losses and reputational damage if it fails to adhere to compliance requirements and the companys compliance policies strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition arising from adverse business decisions poor implementation of business decisions or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings capital or franchise or enterprise value arising from negative public opinion this risk may impair the companys competitiveness by affecting its ability to establish new relationships or services or continue serving existing relationships in addition to the risks identified above other risk factors exist that may impact the company refer to risk factors in the companys annual report on s as well as the potential impact on customers and the domestic economy resulting from the covid19 pandemic the risk management committee oversees the companys credit risk management process in addition credit quality ratings as defined by the company are an important part of the companys overall credit risk management and evaluation of its allowance for credit losses loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on the companys rating scale for problem credits as minimal credit risk has been identified loans with a special mention or classified rating including consumer lending and small business loans that are days or more past due and still accruing nonaccrual loans those loans considered troubled debt restructurings tdrs and loans in a junior lien position that are current but are behind a first lien position on nonaccrual encompass all loans held by the company that it considers to have a potential or welldefined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk the companys internal credit quality ratings for consumer loans are primarily based on delinquency and nonperforming status except for a limited population of larger loans within those portfolios that are individually evaluated for this limited population the determination of the internal credit quality rating may also consider collateral value and customer cash flows refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys loan portfolios including internal credit quality ratings in addition refer to managements discussion and analysis credit risk management in the companys annual report on s and other macroeconomic factors customer payment history and credit scores and in some cases updated loantovalue ltv information reflecting current market conditions on real estatebased loans these and other risk characteristics including risk resulting from the covid19 pandemic are reflected in forecasts of delinquency levels bankruptcies and losses which are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for the consumer lending segment the company further disaggregates its loan portfolio segments into various classes based on their underlying risk characteristics the two classes within the commercial lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans the three classes within the consumer lending segment are residential mortgages credit card loans and other retail loans the companys consumer lending segment utilizes several distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer credit including traditional branch lending mobile and online banking indirect lending alliance partnerships correspondent banks and loan brokers each distinct underwriting and origination activity manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its loan production commensurate with the differing risk profiles residential mortgage originations are generally limited to prime borrowers and are performed through the companys branches loan production offices mobile and online services and a wholesale network of originators the company may retain residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance sheet or sell the loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights and customer relationships utilizing the secondary markets enables the company to effectively reduce its credit and other assetliability risks for residential mortgages that are retained in the companys portfolio and for home equity and second mortgages credit risk is also diversified by geography and managed by adherence to ltv and borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process the company estimates updated ltv information on its outstanding residential mortgages quarterly based on a method that combines automated valuation model updates and relevant home price indices ltv is the ratio of the loans outstanding principal balance to the current estimate of property value for home equity and second mortgages combined loantovalue cltv is the us bancorp combination of the first mortgage original principal balance and the second lien outstanding principal balance relative to the current estimate of property value certain loans do not have an ltv or cltv primarily due to lack of availability of relevant automated valuation model andor home price indices values or lack of necessary valuation data on acquired loans the following tables provide summary information of residential mortgages and home equity and second mortgages by ltv at june

certain circumstances the company may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the nearterm in most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in interest rate extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance that would otherwise not be considered troubled debt restructurings concessionary modifications are classified as tdrs unless the modification results in only an insignificant delay in the payments to be received tdrs accrue interest if the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms over several

may also work with the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate losses such as obtaining additional collateral andor guarantees to support the loan the company has also implemented certain residential mortgage loan restructuring programs that may result in tdrs the company modifies residential mortgage loans under federal housing administration united states department of veterans affairs and its own internal programs under these programs the company offers qualifying homeowners the opportunity to permanently modify their loan and achieve more affordable monthly payments by providing loan concessions these concessions may include adjustments to interest rates conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates extensions of maturity dates or deferrals of payments capitalization of accrued interest andor outstanding advances or in limited situations partial forgiveness of loan principal in most instances participation in residential mortgage loan restructuring programs requires the customer to complete a shortterm trial period a permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer successfully completing the trial period arrangement and the loan documents are not modified until that time the company reports loans in a trial period arrangement as tdrs and continues to report them as tdrs after the trial period credit card and other retail loan tdrs are generally part of distinct restructuring programs providing customers modification solutions over a specified time period generally up to months in accordance with regulatory guidance the company considers secured consumer loans that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy where the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt to be tdrs if the loan amount exceeds the collateral value the

analysis of loan net chargeoffs total loan net chargeoffs were million for the second quarter and million for the first six months of compared with million and million respectively for the same

outstanding on an annualized basis for the second quarter and first six months of was percent and percent respectively compared with percent and percent respectively for the same periods of chargeoff rates benefitted from improving economic conditions borrower liquidity and strong asset prices in the market that support repayment and recovery on problem loans the company expects net chargeoffs to return to more normalized levels over time as the economy rebounds and consumer spending behaviors resume analysis and determination of the allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is established for current expected credit losses on the companys loan and lease portfolio including unfunded credit commitments the allowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives of the applicable assets inclusive of expected recoveries the allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net chargeoffs management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis multiple economic scenarios are considered over a threeyear reasonable and supportable forecast period which includes increasing consideration of historical loss experience over years two and three these economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses after the forecast period the company fully reverts to longterm historical loss experience adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and lease portfolio to estimate losses over the remaining life of the portfolio the economic scenarios are updated at least quarterly and are designed to provide a range of reasonable estimates from better to worse than current expectations scenarios are weighted based on the companys expectation of economic conditions for the foreseeable future and reflect significant judgment and consideration of uncertainties that exist final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses not reflected in the scenarios due to the unique aspects of current conditions and expectations these factors may include but are not limited to loan servicing practices regulatory guidance andor fiscal and monetary policy actions because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans the company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments which is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are included in the companys analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios the allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forwardlooking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors affecting lifetime credit losses these factors include but are not limited to macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates real estate prices gross domestic product levels and corporate bonds spreads as well as loan and borrower characteristics such as internal risk ratings on commercial loans and consumer credit us bancorp scores delinquency status collateral type and available valuation information consideration of endofterm losses on lease residuals and the remaining term of the loan adjusted for expected prepayments for each loan portfolio model estimates are adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition lending policies underwriting standards risk management practices economic conditions or other factors that may affect the accuracy of the model expected credit loss estimates also include consideration of expected cash recoveries on loans previously chargedoff or expected recoveries on collateraldependent loans where recovery is expected through sale of the collateral where loans do not exhibit similar risk characteristics an individual analysis is performed to consider expected credit losses the allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans greater than million in the commercial lending segment is based on an analysis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral less selling costs for collateraldependent loans as appropriate for commercial tdrs individually evaluated for impairment attributes of the borrower are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses however historical loss experience is also incorporated into the allowance methodology applied to this category of loans commercial lending segment tdr loans may be collectively evaluated for impairment where observed performance history including defaults is a primary driver of the loss allocation the allowance recorded for tdr loans in the consumer lending segment is determined on a homogenous pool basis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate of the pool the expected cash flows on tdr loans consider subsequent payment defaults since modification the borrowers ability to pay under the restructured terms and the timing and amount of payments the allowance for collateraldependent loans in the consumer lending segment is determined based on the current fair value of the collateral less costs to sell when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position the company considers the delinquency and modification status of the first lien at june the company serviced the first lien on percent of the home equity loans and lines in a junior lien position the company also considers the status of first lien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files when the first lien is not serviced by the company regardless of whether the company services the first lien an assessment is made of economic conditions problem loans recent loss experience and other factors in determining the allowance for credit losses based on the available information the company estimated million or percent of its total home equity portfolio at june represented nondelinquent junior liens where the first lien was delinquent or modified excluding loans in covidrelated forbearance programs the company considers historical loss experience on the loans and lines in a junior lien position to establish loss estimates for junior lien loans and lines the company services that are current but the first lien is delinquent or modified the historical longterm average loss experience related to junior liens has been relatively limited less than percent of the total portfolio annually and estimates are adjusted to consider current collateral support and portfolio risk characteristics these include updated credit scores and collateral estimates obtained on the companys home equity portfolio each quarter in its evaluation of the allowance for credit losses the company also considers the increased risk of loss associated with home equity lines that are contractually scheduled to convert from a revolving status to a fully amortizing payment beginning january when a loan portfolio is purchased the acquired loans are divided into those considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration pcd and those not considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration an allowance is established for each population and considers product mix risk characteristics of the portfolio bankruptcy experience delinquency status and refreshed ltv ratios when possible the allowance established for purchased loans not considered pcd is recognized through provision expense upon acquisition whereas the allowance established for loans considered pcd at acquisition is offset by an increase in the basis of the acquired loans any subsequent increases and decreases in the allowance related to purchased loans regardless of pcd status are recognized through provision expense with chargeoffs charged to the allowance the company did not have a material amount of pcd loans included in its loan portfolio at june the companys methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used and allocated to the various loan portfolios as a result amounts determined under the methodologies described above are adjusted by management to consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not captured in quantitative model adjustments which include but are not limited to the following model imprecision imprecision in economic scenario assumptions and emerging risks related to either changes in the economic us bancorp environment that are affecting specific portfolios or changes in portfolio concentrations over time that may affect model performance the consideration of these items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the companys allowance for credit losses for each loan portfolio although the company determined the amount of each element of the allowance separately and considers this process to be an important credit management tool the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio the actual amount of losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts at june the allowance for credit losses was billion percent of periodend loans compared with an allowance of billion percent of periodend loans at december the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was percent at june compared with percent at december the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to annualized loan net chargeoffs was percent at june compared with percent of full year net chargeoffs at december the decrease in the allowance for credit losses of billion percent at june compared with december reflected factors affecting economic conditions during the first six months of including the enactment of additional benefits from government stimulus programs vaccine availability in the united states and reduced levels of new covid19 cases which have contributed to an economic recovery however rising inflationary concerns and the impact of pandemic stress continue to weigh on select portfolios in addition to these factors expected loss estimates consider various factors including customer specific information impacting changes in risk ratings projected delinquencies and potential effects of diminishing liquidity without support of mortgage forbearance and direct federal stimulus currently consumer credit trends continue to perform better than expected while select commercial portfolios most impacted by covid19 continue to be monitored for structural shifts associated with the pandemic changes in economic conditions during the first six months of included improvements in projected gross domestic product and unemployment levels for which reflected the additional government stimulus and availability of vaccines these factors are evaluated through a combination of quantitative calculations using economic scenarios and qualitative assessments that consider the high degree of uncertainty related to the unprecedented levels of both economic stress and the stimulus response the following table summarizes the baseline forecast for key economic variables the company used in its estimate of the allowance for credit losses at june and december june december united states unemployment rate for the three months ending a june september december united states real gross domestic product for the three months ending b june september december a reflects quarterly average of forecasted reported united states unemployment rate b reflects cumulative change from december us bancorp baseline economic forecasts are used in combination with alternative scenarios and historical loss experience as is considered reasonable and supportable to inform the companys allowance for credit losses changes in the allowance for credit losses are based on a variety of factors including loan balance changes portfolio credit quality and mix changes and changes in general economic conditions and expectations including for unemployment and gross domestic product among other factors based on economic conditions at june it was difficult to estimate the length and severity of the longer term effects on certain industry sectors that may result from covid19 and the impact of other factors that may influence the level of eventual losses and corresponding requirements for the allowance for credit losses including the impact of inflationary pressures on certain lending sectors and diminishing liquidity after economic stimulus programs and accommodations delaying mortgage and rent payments end while reserves consider the uncertainty in these estimates the unpredictability of the covid19 pandemic could result in the recognition of credit losses in the companys loan portfolios and increases in the allowance for credit losses scenarios worse than the companys expected outcome at june include risks that government stimulus in response to the covid19 pandemic is less effective than expected or that a longer or more severe health crisis prolongs the downturn in economic activity potentially reducing the number of businesses that are ultimately able to resume operations after the crisis has passed other factors considered include the potential of rising interest rates and unsupported increases in the values of certain assets the allowance for credit losses related to commercial lending segment loans decreased million during the first six months of due to improvements in general economic conditions and portfolio credit quality
