based on their underlying risk characteristics the two classes within the commercial lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans the three classes within the consumer lending segment are residential mortgages credit card loans and other retail loans because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans

reduction in interest rate extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance that would otherwise not be considered troubled debt restructurings concessionary modifications are classified as tdrs unless the modification results in only an insignificant delay in the payments to be received tdrs accrue interest if the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and

fixed rates extensions of maturity dates or deferrals of payments capitalization of accrued interest andor outstanding advances or in limited situations partial forgiveness of loan principal in most instances participation in residential mortgage loan restructuring programs requires the customer to complete a shortterm trial period a permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer successfully completing the trial period arrangement and the loan documents are not modified until that time the company reports loans in a trial period arrangement as tdrs and continues to report them as tdrs after the trial period credit card and other retail loan tdrs are generally part of distinct restructuring programs providing customers modification solutions over a specified time period generally up to months in accordance with regulatory guidance the company considers secured consumer loans that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy where the borrower has not reaffirmed the

prior to january the allowance for credit losses was established to reserve for probable and estimable losses incurred in the companys loan and lease portfolio including unfunded credit commitments effective january the company adopted new accounting guidance which changed previous impairment recognition to a model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses the allowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives of the applicable assets inclusive of expected recoveries the allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net chargeoffs management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis multiple economic scenarios are considered over a threeyear reasonable and supportable forecast period which incorporates historical loss experience in years two and three these economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses after the forecast period the company fully reverts to longterm historical loss experience adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and lease portfolio to estimate losses over the remaining life of the portfolio the economic scenarios are updated at least quarterly and are designed to provide a range of reasonable estimates which are both better and worse than current expectations scenarios are weighted based on the companys expectation of economic conditions for the foreseeable future and reflect significant judgment and consider uncertainties that exist final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses not reflected in the scenarios due to the unique aspects of current conditions and expectations these factors may include but are not limited to loan servicing practices regulatory guidance andor fiscal and monetary policy actions because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans the company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments which is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are included in the companys analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios the allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forward looking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors affecting lifetime credit losses these factors include but are not limited to macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates real estate prices gross domestic product levels corporate bonds spreads and longterm interest rate forecasts as well as loan and borrower characteristics such as internal risk ratings on commercial loans and consumer credit scores delinquency status collateral type and available valuation information consideration of endofterm losses on lease residuals and the remaining term of the loan adjusted for expected prepayments for each loan portfolio model estimates are adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition lending policies underwriting standards risk management practices economic conditions or other factors that may affect the accuracy of the model expected credit loss estimates also include consideration of expected cash recoveries on loans previously chargedoff or expected recoveries on collateraldependent loans where recovery is expected through sale of the collateral where loans do not exhibit similar risk characteristics an individual analysis is performed to consider expected credit losses the allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans greater than million in the commercial lending segment is based on an analysis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral less selling costs for collateraldependent loans as appropriate for commercial tdrs

forbearance programs the company considers historical loss experience on the loans and lines in a junior lien position to establish loss estimates for junior lien loans and lines the company services that are current but the first lien is delinquent or modified the historical longterm average loss experience related to junior liens has been relatively limited less than percent of the total portfolio annually and estimates are adjusted to consider current collateral support and portfolio risk characteristics these include updated credit scores and collateral estimates obtained on the companys home equity portfolio each quarter in its evaluation of the allowance for credit losses the company also considers the increased risk of loss associated with home equity lines that are contractually scheduled to convert from a revolving status to a fully amortizing payment beginning january when a loan portfolio is purchased the acquired loans are divided into those considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration pcd and those not considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration an allowance is established for each population and considers product mix risk characteristics of the portfolio bankruptcy experience delinquency status and refreshed ltv ratios when possible the allowance established for purchased loans not considered pcd is recognized through provision expense upon acquisition whereas the allowance established for loans considered pcd at acquisition is offset by an increase in the basis of the acquired loans any subsequent increases and decreases in the allowance related to purchased loans regardless of pcd status are recognized through provision expense with chargeoffs charged to the allowance the company did not have a material amount of pcd loans included in its loan portfolio at december the companys methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used and allocated to the various loan portfolios as a result amounts determined under the methodologies described above are adjusted by management to consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not captured in quantitative model adjustments which include but are not limited to the following model imprecision imprecision in economic scenario assumptions and emerging risks related to either changes in the economic environment that are affecting specific portfolios or changes in portfolio concentrations over time that may affect model performance the consideration of these items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the companys allowance for credit losses for each loan portfolio the results of the analysis are evaluated quarterly to confirm the estimates are appropriate for each loan portfolio table shows the amount of the allowance for credit losses by loan class and underlying portfolio category although the company determined the amount of each element of the allowance separately and considers this process to be an important credit management tool the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio the actual amount of losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts at december the allowance for credit losses was billion percent of periodend loans compared with an allowance of billion percent of periodend loans at december the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was percent at december compared with percent at december the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to annual loan net chargeoffs at december was percent compared with percent at december management determined the allowance for credit losses was appropriate at december the increase in the allowance for credit losses of billion percent at december compared with december reflected the billion impact of the january adoption of new accounting guidance along with an additional billion increase during to recognize the expected losses resulting from the deteriorating and ongoing effects of adverse economic conditions driven by the impact of covid19 on the domestic and global economies as well as new loan production and acquired loans expected loss estimates consider various factors including the changing economic activity potential mitigating effects of government stimulus estimated duration and severity of the health crisis customer specific information impacting changes in risk ratings projected delinquencies and the impact of industrywide loan modification efforts designed to limit longterm effects of the covid19 pandemic among other factors changes in economic conditions in included significant reductions in economic activity related to actions taken by customers and governmental authorities to slow the spread of covid19 levels of employment and overall gross domestic product in the united states declined significantly with the initial wave of the pandemic and had not fully recovered at december which contributed to the increase in expected credit losses at the same time record economic stimulus measures were also enacted and additional measures are being considered with the intent to support businesses and consumers through what is expected to be a period of reduced economic activity these competing positive and negative factors are evaluated through a combination of quantitative calculations using economic scenarios and qualitative assessments that consider the high degree of uncertainty related to the unprecedented levels of both economic stress and the stimulus response the following table summarizes the baseline forecast for key economic variables the company used in its estimate of the allowance for credit losses at january and december united states unemployment rate for the three months endinga december june december united states real gross domestic product for the three months endingb december june december a reflects quarterly average of forecasted reported united states unemployment rate b reflects cumulative change from december january december baseline economic forecasts are used in combination with alternative scenarios and historical loss experience as is considered reasonable and supportable to inform the companys allowance for credit losses changes in the allowance for credit losses are based on a variety of factors including loan balance changes portfolio credit quality and mix changes and changes in general economic conditions and expectations including for unemployment and gross domestic product among other factors based on economic conditions at december it was difficult to estimate the length and severity of the economic downturn that may result from covid19 and the impact of other factors that may influence the level of eventual losses and corresponding requirements for the allowance for credit losses including the impact of economic stimulus programs and customer accommodation activity while reserves consider the uncertainty in these estimates the unpredictability of the covid19 pandemic could continue to result in the recognition of credit losses in the companys loan portfolios and changes in the allowance for credit losses particularly if the economy worsens the allowance for credit losses related to commercial lending segment loans increased billion during the year ended december as increased loan volume and credit downgrades during the period reflected the impact of covid19 on certain industry sectors including the retail and restaurants energy media and entertainment lodging and airline industries that were severely impacted by virus containment measures the following table summarizes the companys commercial lending segment credit exposure to customers within the industry sectors most impacted by covid19 as a percentage of total loans and legal commitments outstanding at december retail energy includes oil and gas media and entertainment lodging airline loans outstanding commitments the allowance for credit losses related to consumer lending segment loans increased million during the year ended december as higher economic risks including those due to increased unemployment and increases in expected losses related to acquired portfolios were partially mitigated by strong underlying credit quality that supports expectations of longterm repayment and the decline in funded loan balances residual value risk management the company manages its risk to changes in the residual value of leased vehicles office and business equipment and other assets through disciplined residual valuation setting at the inception of a lease diversification of its leased assets regular residual asset valuation reviews and monitoring of residual value gains or losses upon the disposition of assets lease originations are subject to the same welldefined underwriting standards referred to in the credit risk management section which includes an evaluation of the residual value risk retail lease residual value risk is mitigated further by effective endofterm marketing of offlease vehicles included in the retail leasing portfolio was approximately billion of retail leasing residuals at december compared with billion at december the company monitors concentrations of leases by manufacturer and vehicle type as of december vehicle lease residuals related to sport utility vehicles were percent of the portfolio while truck and crossover utility vehicle classes represented approximately percent and percent of the portfolio respectively at yearend the individual vehicle model with the largest residual value outstanding represented percent of the aggregate residual value of all vehicles in the portfolio at december and the weightedaverage origination term of the portfolio was months at december the commercial leasing portfolio had million of residuals compared with million at december at yearend lease residuals related to trucks and other transportation equipment represented percent of the total residual portfolio while business and office equipment represented percent operational risk management the company operates in many different businesses in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to process a high number of transactions operational risk is inherent in all business activities and the management of this risk is important to the achievement of the companys objectives business lines have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying controlling and monitoring operational risks embedded in their business activities including those additional or increased risks created by the economic and financial disruptions and the companys alternative working arrangements resulting from the covid19 pandemic the company maintains a system of controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution proper system operations proper oversight of third parties with whom it does business safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft and ensuring the reliability and security of financial and other data business continuation and disaster recovery planning is also critical to effectively managing operational risks each business unit of the company is required to develop maintain and test these plans at least annually to ensure that recovery activities if needed can support mission critical functions including technology networks and data centers supporting customer applications and business operations while the company believes it has designed effective processes to minimize operational risks there is no absolute assurance that business disruption or operational losses would not occur from an external event or internal control breakdown on an ongoing basis management makes process changes and investments to enhance its systems of internal controls and business continuity and disaster recovery plans in the past the company has experienced attack attempts on its computer systems including various denialofservice attacks on customerfacing websites the company has not experienced any material losses relating to these attempts as a result of its controls processes and systems to protect its networks computers software and data from attack damage or unauthorized access but future attacks could be more disruptive or damaging attack attempts on the companys computer systems are evolving and increasing and the company continues to develop and enhance its controls and processes to protect against these attempts compliance risk management the company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions material financial loss or damage to its reputation

supervision and regulation in the companys annual report on form 10k for further discussion of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries interest rate risk management in the banking industry changes in interest rates are a significant risk that can impact earnings and the safety and soundness of an entity the company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by its asset liability management committee alco and approved by the board of directors the alco has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with the alco management policies including interest rate risk exposure table sensitivity of net interest income one way the company measures and analyzes its interest rate risk is through net interest income simulation analysis simulation analysis incorporates substantially all of the companys assets and liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments together with forecasted changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment through this simulation management estimates the impact on net interest income of various interest rate changes that differ in the direction amount and speed of change over time as well as the shape of the yield curve this simulation includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to be affected by changes in loan and deposit growth assumptions are made to project interest rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis managements outlook and repricing strategies these assumptions are reviewed and validated on a periodic basis with sensitivity analysis being provided for key variables of the simulation the results are reviewed monthly by the alco and are used to guide assetliability management strategies the company manages its interest rate risk position by holding assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its balance sheet implementing certain pricing strategies for loans and deposits and selecting derivatives and various funding and investment portfolio strategies table summarizes the projected impact to net interest income over the next months of various potential interest rate changes the sensitivity of the projected impact to net interest income over the next months is dependent on balance sheet

level of interest rates downward rate scenario is not computed use of derivatives to manage interest rate and other risks to manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate prepayment credit price and foreign currency fluctuations asset and liability management positions the company enters into derivative transactions the company uses derivatives for asset and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways to convert fixedrate debt and availableforsale investment securities from fixedrate payments to floatingrate payments to convert the cash flows associated with floatingrate debt from floatingrate payments to fixedrate payments to mitigate changes in value of the companys unfunded mortgage loan commitments funded mlhfs and msrs to mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances and to mitigate the volatility of the companys net investment in foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition the company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its customers customerrelated positions the company minimizes the market and liquidity risks of customer related positions by either entering into similar offsetting positions with brokerdealers or on a portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or nonderivative financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from these customerrelated positions the company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchangetraded centrally cleared through clearinghouses or overthecounter the company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes the company does not designate all of the derivatives that it enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges because of the inefficiency of applying the accounting requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the related hedged items in particular the company enters into interest rate swaps swaptions forward commitments to buy tobeannounced securities tbas us treasury and eurodollar futures and options on us treasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value of its msrs but does not designate those derivatives as accounting hedges the estimated net sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the fair value of the msrs and the related derivative instruments at december to an immediate and bps downward movement in interest rates would be a decrease of approximately million an increase of million and an increase of million respectively an immediate upward movement in interest rates at december of and bps would result in an increase of approximately million million and million in the fair value of the msrs and related derivative instruments respectively refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding msrs additionally the company uses forward commitments to sell tbas and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at specified prices to economically hedge the interest rate risk in its residential mortgage loan production activities at december the company had billion of forward commitments to sell hedging billion of mlhfs and billion of unfunded mortgage loan commitments the forward commitments to sell and the unfunded mortgage loan commitments on loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives under the accounting guidance related to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities the company has elected the fair value option for the mlhfs derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the contracts credit risk associated with derivatives is measured by the company based on the probability of counterparty default including consideration of the covid19 pandemic the company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties by entering into master netting arrangements and where possible by requiring collateral arrangements the company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to third parties through the use of risk participation agreements in addition certain interest rate swaps interest rate forwards and credit contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk for additional information on derivatives and hedging activities refer to notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements libor transition in july the united kingdoms financial conduct authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the london interbank offered rate libor after in november the intercontinental exchange benchmark administration which is the administrator of libor proposed to cease the publication of all nonunited states dollar libor rates and one week and two month united states dollar libor rates on december but extend the publication of the remainder of united states dollar libor rates until june the company holds financial instruments that will be impacted by the discontinuance of libor including certain loans investment securities derivatives borrowings and other financial instruments that use libor as the benchmark rate the company also provides various services to customers in its capacity as trustee which involve financial instruments that will be similarly impacted by the discontinuance of libor the company anticipates these financial instruments will require transition to a new reference rate this transition will occur over time as many of these arrangements do not have an alternative rate referenced in their contracts or a clear path for the parties to agree upon an alternative reference rate in order to facilitate the transition process the company has instituted a libor transition office and commenced an enterprisewide project to identify assess and monitor risks associated with the expected discontinuance or unavailability of libor actively engage with industry working groups and regulators achieve operational readiness and engage impacted customers during the company began modifying its systems models procedures and internal infrastructure to be prepared to accept alternative reference rates the company also adopted industry best practice guidelines for fallback language for new transactions converted its cleared interest rate swaps discounting to secured overnight financing rate discounting and distributed communications to certain impacted parties both inside and outside the company on the transition refer to risk factors beginning on page for further discussion on potential risks that could adversely affect the companys financial results as a result of the libor transition market risk management in addition to interest rate risk the company is exposed to other forms of market risk principally related to trading activities which support customers strategies to manage their own foreign currency interest rate risk and funding activities for purposes of its internal capital adequacy assessment process the company considers risk arising from its trading activities as well as the remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances included on its consolidated balance sheet collectively covered positions employing methodologies consistent with the requirements of regulatory rules for market risk the companys market risk committee mrc within the framework of the alco oversees market risk management the mrc monitors and reviews the companys covered positions and establishes policies for market risk management including exposure limits for each portfolio the company uses a var approach to measure general market risk theoretically var represents the statistical risk of loss the company has to adverse market movements over a oneday time horizon the company uses the historical simulation method to calculate var for its covered positions measured at the ninety ninth percentile using a oneyear lookback period for distributions derived from past market data the market factors used in the calculations include those pertinent to market risks inherent in the underlying trading portfolios principally those that affect the companys corporate bond trading business foreign currency transaction business client derivatives business loan trading business and municipal securities business as well as those inherent in the companys foreign denominated balances and the derivatives used to mitigate the related measurement volatility on average the company expects the oneday var to be exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year related to these positions the company monitors the accuracy of internal var models and modeling processes by backtesting model performance regularly updating the historical data used by the var models and regular model validations to assess the accuracy of the models input processing and reporting components all models are required to be independently reviewed and approved prior to being placed in use if the company were to experience market losses in excess of the estimated var more often than expected the var models and associated assumptions would be analyzed and adjusted the average high low and periodend oneday var amounts for the companys covered positions were as follows year ended december  in millions average high low periodend given the market volatility in the first quarter of resulting from effects of the covid19 pandemic the company experienced actual losses for its combined covered positions that exceeded var five times during the year ended december the company did not experience any actual losses for its combined covered positions that exceeded var during the company stress tests its market risk measurements to provide management with perspectives on market events that may not be captured by its var models including worst case historical market movement combinations that have not necessarily occurred on the same date the company calculates stressed var using the same underlying methodology and model as var except that a historical continuous oneyear lookback period is utilized that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the companys covered positions the period selected by the company includes the significant market volatility of the last four months of the average high low and periodend oneday stressed var amounts for the companys covered positions were as follows year ended december  in millions average high low periodend valuations of positions in client derivatives and foreign currency activities are based on discounted cash flow or other valuation techniques using marketbased assumptions these valuations are compared to thirdparty quotes or other market prices to determine if there are significant variances significant variances are approved by senior management in the companys corporate functions valuation of positions in the corporate bond trading loan trading and municipal securities businesses are based on trader marks these trader marks are evaluated against thirdparty prices with significant variances approved by senior management in the companys corporate functions the company also measures the market risk of its hedging activities related to residential mlhfs and msrs using the historical simulation method the vars are measured at the ninetyninth percentile and employ factors pertinent to the market risks inherent in the valuation of the assets and hedges a oneyear lookback period is used to obtain past market data for the models the average high and low var amounts for the residential

capital ratios defined by banking regulators the company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy including tangible common equity to tangible assets tangible common equity to riskweighted assets and common equity tier capital to riskweighted assets reflecting the full implementation of the cecl methodology these capital measures are viewed by management as useful additional methods of evaluating the companys utilization of its capital held and the level of capital available to withstand unexpected negative market or economic conditions additionally presentation of these measures allows investors analysts and banking regulators to assess the companys capital position relative to other financial services companies these capital measures are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles gaap or are not currently effective or defined in banking regulations in addition certain of these measures differ from currently effective capital ratios defined by banking regulations principally in that the currently effective ratios which are subject to certain transitional provisions temporarily exclude the impact of the adoption of accounting guidance related to impairment of financial instruments based on the cecl methodology as a result these capital measures disclosed by the company may be considered nongaap financial measures management believes this information helps investors assess trends in the companys capital adequacy the company also discloses net interest income and related ratios and analysis on a taxableequivalent basis which may also be considered nongaap financial measures the company believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison of net interest income arising from taxable and taxexempt sources in addition certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio and net interest margin utilize net interest income on a taxableequivalent basis there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors as a result the company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial

the expected impact of these changes in accounting standards to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects the companys financial condition or results of operations the impacts are discussed in the applicable sections of the managements discussion and analysis and the notes to consolidated financial statements critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions the companys financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions which are integral to understanding the companys financial statements critical accounting policies are those policies management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results and require management to make estimates that are difficult subjective or complex most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements these factors include among other things whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements the nature of the estimates the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including thirdparty sources or available prices sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under gaap management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with the companys audit committee significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements those policies considered to be critical accounting policies are described below allowance for credit losses managements evaluation of the appropriate allowance for credit losses is often the most critical of all the accounting estimates for a banking institution it is an inherently subjective process impacted by many factors as discussed throughout the managements discussion and analysis section of the annual report the methods utilized to estimate the allowance for credit losses key assumptions and quantitative and qualitative information considered by management in determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses at december are discussed in the credit risk management section although methodologies utilized to determine each element of the allowance reflect managements assessment of credit risk as identified through assessments completed of individual credits and of homogenous pools affected by material credit events degrees of imprecision exist in these measurement tools due in part to subjective judgments involved and an inherent lag in the data available to quantify current conditions and events that affect credit loss reserve estimates as discussed in the analysis and determination of allowance for credit losses section management considered the effect of changes in economic conditions risk management practices and other factors that contributed to imprecision of loss estimates in determining the allowance for credit losses if not considered expected losses in the credit portfolio related to imprecision and other subjective factors could have a dramatic adverse impact on the liquidity and financial viability of a banking institution given the many quantitative variables and subjective factors affecting the credit portfolio changes in the allowance for credit losses may not directly coincide with changes in the risk ratings of the credit portfolio reflected in the risk rating process this is in part due to the timing of the risk rating process in relation to changes in the business cycle the exposure and mix of loans within risk rating categories levels of nonperforming loans and the timing of chargeoffs and expected recoveries the allowance for credit losses on commercial lending segment loans measures the expected loss content on the remaining portfolio exposure while nonperforming loans and net chargeoffs are measures of specific impairment events that have already been confirmed therefore the degree of change in the forwardlooking expected loss in the commercial lending allowance may differ from the level of changes in nonperforming loans and net chargeoffs management maintains an appropriate allowance for credit losses by updating allowance rates to reflect changes in expected losses including expected changes in economic or business cycle conditions some factors considered in determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses are more readily quantifiable while other factors require extensive qualitative judgment management conducts an analysis with respect to the accuracy of risk ratings and the volatility of expected losses and utilizes this analysis along with qualitative factors that can affect the precision of credit loss estimates including economic conditions such as changes in gross domestic product unemployment or bankruptcy rates and concentration risks such as risks associated with specific industries collateral valuations and loans to highly leveraged enterprises in determining the overall level of the allowance for credit losses the company considers a range of economic scenarios in its determination of the allowance for credit losses these scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses and also the expectation that conditions will eventually normalize over the longer run scenarios worse than the companys expected outcome at december include risks that government stimulus in response to the covid19 pandemic is less broad or less effective than expected or that a longer or more severe health crisis prolongs the downturn in recorded on the balance sheet for a particular asset or liability with related impacts to earnings or other comprehensive income loss when available trading and availableforsale securities are valued based on quoted market prices however certain securities are traded less actively and therefore quoted market prices may not be available the determination of fair value may require benchmarking to similar instruments or performing a discounted cash flow analysis using estimates of future cash flows and prepayment interest and default rates for more information on investment securities refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements as few derivative contracts are listed on an exchange the majority of the companys derivative positions are valued using valuation techniques that use readily observable market inputs certain derivatives however must be valued using techniques that include unobservable inputs for these instruments the significant assumptions must be estimated and therefore are subject to judgment note of the notes to consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the companys derivative positions refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding estimations of fair value mortgage servicing rights msrs are capitalized as separate assets when loans are sold and servicing is retained or may be purchased from others the company records msrs at fair value because msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices the company determines the fair value by estimating the present value of the assets future cash flows utilizing marketbased prepayment rates option adjusted spread and other assumptions validated through comparison to trade information industry surveys and independent thirdparty valuations changes in the fair value of msrs are recorded in earnings during the period in which they occur risks inherent in the valuation of msrs include higher than expected prepayment rates andor delayed receipt of cash flows the company utilizes derivatives including interest rate swaps swaptions forward commitments to buy tbas us treasury and eurodollar futures and options on us treasury futures to mitigate the valuation risk refer to notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the assumptions used in determining the fair value of msrs and an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the fair value of the msrs portfolio and the related derivative instruments used to mitigate the valuation risk economic activity reducing the number of businesses that are ultimately able to resume operations after the crisis has passed under the range of economic scenarios considered the allowance for credit losses would have been lower by million or higher by billion this range reflects the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses specifically related to the scenarios and weights considered as of december and does not consider other potential adjustments that could increase or decrease loss estimates calculated using alternative economic scenarios because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the allowance for credit losses these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance for credit losses they are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in the economy on the companys modeled loss estimates for the loan portfolio and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk rating or loss rates given current processes employed by the company management believes the risk ratings and loss model estimates currently assigned are appropriate it is possible that others given the same information may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions that could be significant to the companys financial statements refer to the analysis and determination of the allowance for credit losses section for further information fair value estimates a portion of the companys assets and liabilities are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded either through earnings or other comprehensive income loss in accordance with applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the united states these include all of the companys availableforsale investment securities derivatives and other trading instruments msrs and mlhfs the estimation of fair value also affects other loans held for sale which are recorded at the lowerofcostorfair value the determination of fair value is important for certain other assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates including goodwill and other intangible assets impaired loans oreo and other repossessed assets fair value is generally defined as the exit price at which an asset or liability could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing unrelated parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale fair value is based on quoted market prices in an active market or if market prices are not available is estimated using models employing techniques such as matrix pricing or discounting expected cash flows the significant assumptions used in the models which include assumptions for interest rates discount rates prepayments and credit losses are independently verified against observable market data where possible where observable market data is not available the estimate of fair value becomes more subjective and involves a high degree of judgment in this circumstance fair value is estimated based on managements judgment regarding the value that market participants would assign to the asset or liability this valuation process takes into consideration factors such as market illiquidity imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount income taxes the company estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which it operates including federal state and local domestic jurisdictions and an insignificant amount to foreign jurisdictions the estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statement of income accrued taxes are reported in other assets or other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets are recognized if in managements judgment their realizability is determined to be more likely than not uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize an uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement in estimating accrued taxes the company assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances it is possible that others given the same information may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions regarding the estimated amounts of accrued taxes changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates interpretations of tax laws the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities and newly enacted statutory judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions these changes when they occur affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the company refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional
