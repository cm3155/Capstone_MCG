extensions of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase or decrease to the interest rate the company may also work with the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate losses

rates conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates extensions of maturity dates or deferrals of payments capitalization of accrued interest andor outstanding advances or in limited situations partial forgiveness of loan principal in most instances participation in residential mortgage loan restructuring programs requires the customer to complete a shortterm trial period a permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer successfully completing the trial period arrangement and the loan documents are not modified until that time the company reports loans in a trial period arrangement as tdrs and continues to report them as tdrs after the trial period credit card and other retail loan tdrs are generally part of distinct restructuring programs providing customers modification solutions over a specified time period generally up to months in accordance with regulatory guidance the company considers secured consumer loans that have had debt discharged through

credit losses was established to reserve for probable and estimable losses incurred in the companys loan and lease portfolio including unfunded credit commitments effective january the company adopted new accounting guidance which changes previous impairment recognition to a model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses the allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net chargeoffs management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis the evaluation of each element and the overall allowance is based on a continuing assessment of problem loans recent loss experience and other factors including external factors such as regulatory guidance and economic conditions because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans the company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments which is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are included in the companys analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios at december the allowance for credit losses was billion percent of periodend loans compared with an allowance of billion percent of periodend loans at december the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was percent at december compared with percent at december the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to annual loan net chargeoffs at december was percent compared with percent at december management determined the allowance for credit losses was appropriate at december the allowance recorded for loans in the commercial lending segment through december was based on reviews of individual credit relationships and considered the migration analysis of commercial lending segment loans and actual loss experience for each loan type this historical loss experience was adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition lending policies underwriting standards risk management practices or economic conditions the results of the analysis were evaluated quarterly to confirm the selected loss experience was appropriate for each commercial loan type the allowance recorded for impaired loans greater than million in the commercial lending segment was based on an individual loan analysis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral less selling costs for collateraldependent loans rather than the migration analysis the allowance recorded for

allowance for credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position the company considered the delinquency and modification status of the first lien at december the company serviced the first lien on percent of the home equity loans and lines in a junior lien position the company also considered information received from its primary regulator on the status of the first liens that were serviced by other large servicers in the industry and the status of first lien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files regardless of whether or not the company serviced the first lien an assessment was made of economic conditions problem loans recent loss experience and other factors in determining the allowance for credit losses based on the available information the company estimated million or percent of its total home equity portfolio at december represented nondelinquent junior liens where the first lien was delinquent or modified the company used historical loss experience on the loans and lines in a junior lien position where the first lien was serviced by the company or could be identified in credit bureau data to establish loss estimates for junior lien loans and lines the company serviced that were current but the first lien was delinquent or modified historically the number of junior lien defaults has been a small percentage of the total portfolio approximately percent annually while the longterm average loss rate on loans that default has been approximately percent in addition the company obtains updated credit scores on its home equity portfolio each quarter and in some cases more frequently and used this information to qualitatively supplement its loss estimation methods credit score distributions for the portfolio are monitored monthly and any changes in the distribution are one of the factors considered in assessing the companys loss estimates in its evaluation of the allowance for credit losses the company also considered the increased risk of loss associated with home equity lines that are contractually scheduled to convert from a revolving status to a fully amortizing payment and with residential lines and loans that have a balloon payoff provision the allowance established for consumer lending segment loans was billion at december and reflecting overall portfolio growth partially offset by continued improvement in housing market conditions in addition through december the evaluation of the appropriate allowance for credit losses on purchased nonimpaired loans acquired after january in the various loan segments considered credit discounts recorded as a part of the initial determination of the fair value of the loans for these loans no allowance for credit losses was recorded at the purchase date credit discounts representing the principal losses expected over the life of the loans were a component of the initial fair value subsequent to the purchase date the methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for credit losses for these loans was similar to originated loans however the company recorded a provision for credit losses only when the required allowance exceeded any remaining credit discounts the evaluation of the appropriate allowance for credit losses for purchased impaired loans in the various loan segments through december considered the expected cash flows to be collected from the borrower these loans were initially recorded at fair value and therefore no allowance for credit losses was recorded at the purchase date subsequent to the purchase date the expected cash flows of purchased loans were subject to evaluation decreases in expected cash flows were recognized by recording an allowance for credit losses if the expected cash flows on the purchased loans increased such that a previously recorded impairment allowance could have been reversed the company recorded a reduction in the allowance increases in expected cash flows of purchased loans when there are no reversals of previous impairment allowances were recognized over the remaining life of the loans refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information the companys methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses for both loan segments also considered the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used as a result in addition to the amounts determined under the methodologies described above management also considered the potential impact of other qualitative factors which include but are not limited to the following economic factors geographic and other concentration risks delinquency and nonaccrual trends current business conditions changes in lending policy underwriting standards and other relevant business practices results of internal review and the regulatory environment the consideration of these items resulted in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the companys allowance for credit losses for both loan segments table shows the amount of the allowance for credit losses by loan class and underlying portfolio category although the company determined the amount of each element of the allowance separately and considers this process to be an important credit management tool the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio the actual amount of losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts residual value risk management the company manages its risk to changes in the residual value of leased vehicles office and business equipment and other assets through disciplined residual valuation setting at the inception of a lease diversification of its leased assets regular residual asset valuation reviews and monitoring of residual value gains or losses upon the disposition of assets lease originations are subject to the same welldefined underwriting standards referred to in the credit risk management section which includes an evaluation of the residual value risk retail lease residual value risk is mitigated further by effective endofterm marketing of offlease vehicles included in the retail leasing portfolio was

and the safety and soundness of an entity the company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by its asset liability management committee alco and approved by the board of directors the alco has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with the alco management policies including interest rate risk exposure one way the company measures and analyzes its interest rate risk is through net interest income simulation analysis simulation analysis incorporates substantially all of the companys assets and liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments together with forecasted changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment through this simulation management estimates the impact on net interest income of various interest rate changes that differ in the direction amount and speed of change over table sensitivity of net interest income time as well as the shape of the yield curve this simulation includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to be affected by changes in loan and deposit growth assumptions are made to project interest rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis managements outlook and repricing strategies these assumptions are reviewed and validated on a periodic basis with sensitivity analysis being provided for key variables of the simulation the results are reviewed monthly by the alco and are used to guide assetliability management strategies the company manages its interest rate risk position by holding assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its balance sheet implementing certain pricing strategies for loans and deposits and selecting derivatives and various funding and investment portfolio strategies table summarizes the projected impact to net interest income over the next months of various potential interest rate changes the sensitivity of the projected impact to net interest income over the next months is dependent on balance sheet growth product mix deposit behavior pricing and funding decisions while the company utilizes assumptions based on historical information and expected behaviors actual outcomes could vary significantly for example if deposit outflows are more limited stable than the assumptions the company used in preparing table the projected impact to net interest income would be an increase of percent in the up bps and percent in the up bps scenarios december december down bps up bps down bps up bps gradual immediate immediate gradual down bps up bps down bps up bps gradual immediate immediate gradual net interest income given the level of interest rates downward rate scenario is not computed use of derivatives to manage interest rate and other risks to manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate prepayment credit price and foreign currency fluctuations asset and liability management positions the company enters into derivative transactions the company uses derivatives for asset and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways to convert fixedrate debt from fixedrate payments to floating rate payments to convert the cash flows associated with floatingrate debt from floatingrate payments to fixedrate payments to mitigate changes in value of the companys unfunded mortgage loan commitments funded mlhfs and msrs to mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances and to mitigate the volatility of the companys net investment in foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition the company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its customers customerrelated positions the company minimizes the market and liquidity risks of customer related positions by either entering into similar offsetting positions with brokerdealers or on a portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or nonderivative financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from these customerrelated positions the company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchangetraded centrally cleared through clearinghouses or overthecounter the company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes the company does not designate all of the derivatives that it enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges because of the inefficiency of applying the accounting requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the related hedged items in particular the company enters into interest rate swaps swaptions forward commitments to buy tobeannounced securities tbas us treasury and eurodollar futures and options on us treasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value of its msrs but does not designate those derivatives as accounting hedges the estimated net sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the fair value of the msrs and the related derivative instruments at december to an immediate and bps downward movement in interest rates would be a decrease of approximately million million and million respectively an immediate upward movement in interest rates at december of and bps would result in a decrease of approximately million million and million in the fair value of the msrs and related derivative instruments respectively refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding msrs additionally the company uses forward commitments to sell tbas and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at specified prices to economically hedge the interest rate risk in its residential mortgage loan production activities at december the company had billion of forward commitments to sell hedging billion of mlhfs and billion of unfunded mortgage loan commitments the forward commitments to sell and the unfunded mortgage loan commitments on loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives under the accounting guidance related to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities the company has elected the fair value option for the mlhfs derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the contracts credit risk associated with derivatives is measured by the company based on the probability of counterparty default the company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties by entering into master netting arrangements and where possible by requiring collateral arrangements the company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to third parties through the use of risk participation agreements in addition certain interest rate swaps interest rate forwards and credit contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk for additional information on derivatives and hedging activities refer to notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements libor transition in july the united kingdoms financial conduct authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the london interbank offered rate libor after the company holds financial instruments that will be impacted by the discontinuance of libor including certain loans investment securities derivatives borrowings and other financial instruments that use libor as the benchmark rate the company also provides various services to customers in its capacity as trustee which involve financial instruments that will be similarly impacted by the discontinuance of libor the company anticipates these financial instruments will require transition to a new reference rate this transition will occur over the next several years as many of these arrangements do not have an alternative rate referenced in their contracts or a clear path for the parties to agree upon an alternative reference rate in order to facilitate the transition process the company has instituted a libor transition office and commenced an enterprisewide project to identify assess and monitor risks associated with the expected discontinuance or unavailability of libor actively engage with industry working groups and regulators achieve operational readiness and engage impacted customers refer to risk factors beginning on page for further discussion on potential risks that could adversely affect the companys financial results as a result of the libor transition market risk management in addition to interest rate risk the company is exposed to other forms of market risk principally related to trading activities which support customers strategies to manage their own foreign currency interest rate risk and funding activities for purposes of its internal capital adequacy assessment process the company considers risk arising from its trading activities as well as the remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances included on its consolidated balance sheet collectively covered positions employing methodologies consistent with the requirements of regulatory rules for market risk the companys market risk committee mrc within the framework of the alco oversees market risk management the mrc monitors and reviews the companys covered positions and establishes policies for market risk management including exposure limits for each portfolio the company uses a var approach to measure general market risk theoretically var represents the statistical risk of loss the company has to adverse market movements over a oneday time horizon the company uses the historical simulation method to calculate var for its covered positions measured at the ninety ninth percentile using a oneyear lookback period for distributions derived from past market data the market factors used in the calculations include those pertinent to market risks inherent in the underlying trading portfolios principally those that affect the companys corporate bond trading business foreign currency transaction business client derivatives business loan trading business and municipal securities business as well as those inherent in the companys foreign denominated balances and the derivatives used to mitigate the related measurement volatility on average the company expects the oneday var to be exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year related to these positions the company monitors the accuracy of internal var models and modeling processes by backtesting model performance regularly updating the historical data used by the var models and regular model validations to assess the accuracy of the models input processing and reporting components all models are required to be independently reviewed and approved prior to being placed in use if the company were to experience market losses in excess of the estimated var more often than expected the var models and associated assumptions would be analyzed and adjusted the company calculates stressed var using the same underlying methodology and model as var except that a historical continuous oneyear lookback period is utilized that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the companys covered positions the period selected by the company includes the significant market volatility of the last four months of the average high low and periodend oneday stressed var amounts for the companys covered positions were as follows year ended december  in millions average high low periodend valuations of positions in client derivatives and foreign currency activities are based on discounted cash flow or other valuation techniques using marketbased assumptions these valuations are compared to thirdparty quotes or other market prices to determine if there are significant variances significant variances are approved by senior management in the companys corporate functions valuation of positions in the corporate bond trading loan trading and municipal securities businesses are based on trader marks these trader marks are evaluated against thirdparty prices with significant variances approved by senior management in the companys corporate functions the company also measures the market risk of its hedging activities related to residential mlhfs and msrs using the historical simulation method the vars are measured at the ninetyninth percentile and employ factors pertinent to the market risks inherent in the valuation of the assets and hedges a oneyear lookback period is used to obtain past market data for the models the average high and low var amounts for the residential mlhfs and related hedges and the msrs and related hedges were as follows the average high low and periodend oneday var amounts for the companys covered positions were as follows year ended december  in millions year ended december  in millions average high low periodend the company did not experience any actual losses for its combined covered positions that exceeded var during and the company stress tests its market risk measurements to provide management with perspectives on market events that may not be captured by its var models including worst case historical market movement combinations that have not necessarily occurred on the same date residential mortgage loans held for sale and related hedges average high low mortgage servicing rights and related hedges average high low liquidity risk management the companys liquidity risk management process is designed to identify measure and manage the companys funding and liquidity risk to meet its daily funding needs and to address expected and unexpected changes in its funding requirements the company engages in various activities to manage its liquidity risk

financial measures in addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators the company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy including tangible common equity to tangible assets and tangible common equity to riskweighted assets these capital measures are viewed by management as useful additional methods of evaluating the companys utilization of its capital held and the level of capital available to withstand unexpected negative market or economic conditions additionally presentation of these measures allows investors analysts and banking regulators to assess the companys capital position relative to other financial services companies these capital measures are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles gaap or are not defined in banking regulations as a result these capital measures disclosed by the company may be considered nongaap financial measures management believes this information helps investors assess trends in the companys capital adequacy the company also discloses net interest income and related ratios and analysis on a taxableequivalent basis which may also be considered nongaap financial measures the company believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison of net interest income arising from taxable and taxexempt sources in addition certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio and net interest margin utilize net interest income on a taxableequivalent basis there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors as a result the company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this report in their

financial statements discusses accounting standards recently issued but not yet required to be adopted and the expected impact of these changes in accounting standards to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects the companys financial condition or results of operations the impacts are discussed in the applicable sections of the managements discussion and analysis and the notes to consolidated financial statements critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions the companys financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions which are integral to understanding the companys financial statements critical accounting policies are those policies management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results and require management to make estimates that are difficult subjective or complex most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements these factors include among other things whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements the nature of the estimates the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including thirdparty sources or available prices sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under gaap management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with the companys audit committee significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements those policies considered to be critical accounting policies are described below allowance for credit losses managements evaluation of the appropriate allowance for credit losses is often the most critical of all the accounting estimates for a banking institution it is an inherently subjective process impacted by many factors as discussed throughout the managements discussion and analysis section of the annual report through december the allowance for credit losses was established to provide for probable and estimable losses incurred in the companys credit portfolio effective january the company adopted new accounting guidance which changes previous impairment recognition to a model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion on the effect of the adoption of this guidance on the companys financial statements the methods utilized to estimate the allowance for credit losses key assumptions and quantitative and qualitative information considered by management in determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses at december are discussed in the credit risk management section although methodologies utilized to determine each element of the allowance reflect managements assessment of credit risk as identified through assessments completed of individual credits and of homogenous pools affected by material credit events degrees of imprecision exist in these measurement tools due in part to subjective judgments involved and an inherent lag in the data available to quantify current conditions and events that affect credit loss reserve estimates as discussed in the analysis and determination of allowance for credit losses section management considered the effect of changes in economic conditions risk management practices and other factors that contributed to imprecision of loss estimates in determining the allowance for credit losses if not considered incurred losses in the credit portfolio related to imprecision and other subjective factors could have a dramatic adverse impact on the liquidity and financial viability of a banking institution given the many subjective factors affecting the credit portfolio changes in the allowance for credit losses may not directly coincide with changes in the risk ratings of the credit portfolio reflected in the risk rating process this is in part due to the timing of the risk rating process in relation to changes in the business cycle the exposure and mix of loans within risk rating categories levels of nonperforming loans and the timing of chargeoffs and recoveries the allowance for credit losses on commercial lending segment loans measures the incurred loss content on the remaining portfolio exposure while nonperforming loans and net chargeoffs are measures of specific impairment events that have already been confirmed therefore the degree of change in the commercial lending allowance may differ from the level of changes in nonperforming loans and net chargeoffs management maintains an appropriate allowance for credit losses by updating aggregate allowance rates to reflect changes in economic uncertainty or business cycle conditions some factors considered in determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses are quantifiable while other factors require qualitative judgment management conducts an analysis with respect to the accuracy of risk ratings and the volatility of inherent losses and utilizes this analysis along with qualitative factors that can affect the precision of credit loss estimates including economic conditions such as changes in unemployment or bankruptcy rates and concentration risks such as risks associated with specific industries collateral valuations and loans to highly leveraged enterprises in determining the overall level of the allowance for credit losses the companys determination of the allowance for commercial lending segment loans is sensitive to the assigned credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates at december if percent of period ending loan balances including unfunded commitments within each risk category of this segment of the loan portfolio experienced downgrades of two risk categories the allowance for credit losses would have increased by approximately million at december the company believes the allowance for credit losses appropriately considers the imprecision in estimating credit losses based on credit risk ratings and inherent loss rates but actual losses may differ from those estimates if inherent loss or estimated loss rates for commercial lending segment loans increased by percent the allowance for credit losses would have increased by approximately million at december the companys determination of the allowance for consumer lending segment loans is sensitive to changes in estimated loss rates and estimated impairments on restructured loans in the event that estimated losses for this segment of the loan portfolio increased by percent the allowance for credit losses would have increased by approximately million at december because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the allowance for credit losses these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance for credit losses they are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in risk rating and inherent losses and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk rating or loss rates given current processes employed by the company management believes the risk ratings and inherent loss rates currently assigned are appropriate it is possible that others given the same information may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions that could be significant to the companys financial statements refer to the analysis and determination of the allowance for credit losses section for further information fair value estimates a portion of the companys assets and liabilities are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded either through earnings or other comprehensive income loss in accordance with applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the united states these include all of the companys availableforsale investment securities derivatives and other trading instruments msrs and mlhfs the estimation of fair value also affects other loans held for sale which are recorded at the lowerofcostorfair value the determination of fair value is important for certain other assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates including goodwill and other intangible assets impaired loans oreo and other repossessed assets fair value is generally defined as the exit price at which an asset or liability could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing unrelated parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale fair value is based on quoted market prices in an active market or if market prices are not available is estimated using models employing techniques such as matrix pricing or discounting expected cash flows the significant assumptions used in the models which include assumptions for interest rates discount rates prepayments and credit losses are independently verified against observable market data where possible where observable market data is not available the estimate of fair value becomes more subjective and involves a high degree of judgment in this circumstance fair value is estimated based on managements judgment regarding the value that market participants would assign to the asset or liability this valuation process takes into consideration factors such as market illiquidity imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount recorded on the balance sheet for a particular asset or liability with related impacts to earnings or other comprehensive income loss when available trading and availableforsale securities are valued based on quoted market prices however certain securities are traded less actively and therefore quoted market prices may not be available the determination of fair value may require benchmarking to similar instruments or performing a discounted cash flow analysis using estimates of future cash flows and prepayment interest and default rates for more information on investment securities refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements as few derivative contracts are listed on an exchange the majority of the companys derivative positions are valued using valuation techniques that use readily observable market inputs certain derivatives however must be valued using techniques that include unobservable inputs for these instruments the significant assumptions must be estimated and therefore are subject to judgment note of the notes to consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the companys derivative positions refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding estimations of fair value mortgage servicing rights msrs are capitalized as separate assets when loans are sold and servicing is retained or may be purchased from others the company records msrs at fair value because msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices the company determines the fair value by estimating the present value of the assets future cash flows utilizing marketbased prepayment rates option adjusted spread and other assumptions validated through comparison to trade information industry surveys and independent thirdparty valuations changes in the fair value of msrs are recorded in earnings during the period in which they occur risks inherent in the valuation of msrs include higher than expected prepayment rates andor delayed receipt of cash flows the company utilizes derivatives including interest rate swaps swaptions forward commitments to buy tbas us treasury and eurodollar futures and options on us treasury futures to mitigate the valuation risk refer to notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the assumptions used in determining the fair value of msrs and an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the fair value of the msrs portfolio and the related derivative instruments used to mitigate the valuation risk income taxes the company estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which it operates including federal state and local domestic jurisdictions and an insignificant amount to foreign jurisdictions the estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statement of income accrued taxes are reported in other assets or other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets are recognized if in managements judgment their realizability is determined to be more likely than not uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize an uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement in estimating accrued taxes the company assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances it is possible that others given the same information may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions regarding the estimated amounts of accrued taxes changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates interpretations of tax laws the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities and newly enacted statutory judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions these changes when they occur affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the company refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional
