note repayments refer to the liquidity risk management section for discussion of liquidity management of the company corporate risk profile overview managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company the companys board of directors has approved a risk management framework which establishes governance and risk management requirements for all risktaking activities this framework includes company and business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing business objectives and initiatives the board of directors primarily through its risk management committee oversees performance relative to the risk management framework risk appetite statements and other policy requirements the executive risk committee erc which is chaired by the chief risk officer and includes the chief executive officer and other members of the executive management team oversees execution against the risk management framework and risk appetite statements the erc focuses on current and emerging risks including strategic and e e a a a bc d us bancorp reputation risks by directing timely and comprehensive actions senior operating committees have also been established each responsible for overseeing a specified category of risk the companys most prominent risk exposures are credit interest rate market liquidity operational compliance strategic and reputation credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a change in the credit profile or the failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its contractual obligations interest rate risk is the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital or market valuations arising from the impact of changes in interest rates market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates foreign exchange rates and security prices that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments such as trading and availableforsale investment securities mortgage loans held for sale mlhfs mortgage servicing rights msrs and derivatives that are accounted for on a fair value basis liquidity risk is the risk that financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the companys inability or perceived inability to meet its cash flow obligations in a timely and complete manner in either normal or stressed conditions operational risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems people including human errors or misconduct or adverse external events including the risk of loss resulting from breaches in data security operational risk can also include the risk of loss due to failures by third parties with which the company does business compliance risk is the risk that the company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions financial losses and reputational damage if it fails to adhere to compliance requirements and the companys compliance policies strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from adverse business decisions poor implementation of business decisions or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings capital or franchise or enterprise value arising from negative public opinion this risk may impair the companys competitiveness by affecting its ability to establish new relationships or services or continue serving existing relationships in addition to the risks identified above other risk factors exist that may impact the company refer to risk factors in the companys annual report on s the risk management committee oversees the companys credit risk management process us bancorp in addition credit quality ratings as defined by the company are an important part of the companys overall credit risk management and evaluation of its allowance for credit losses loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on the companys rating scale for problem credits as minimal credit risk has been identified loans with a special mention or classified rating including consumer lending and small business loans that are days or more past due and still accruing nonaccrual loans and loans in a junior lien position that are current but are behind a first lien position on nonaccrual encompass all loans held by the company that it considers to have a potential or welldefined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk the companys internal credit quality ratings for consumer loans are primarily based on delinquency and nonperforming status refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys loan portfolios including internal credit quality ratings in addition refer to managements discussion and analysis credit risk management in the companys annual report on s household debt levels real disposable income and other macroeconomic factors customer payment history and credit scores effect of higher interest rates on variable rate or adjustable rate loans and in some cases updated loantovalue ltv information reflecting current market conditions on secured loans these and other risk characteristics are reflected in forecasts of delinquency levels bankruptcies and losses which are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for the consumer lending segment the company further disaggregates its loan portfolio segments into various classes based on their underlying risk characteristics the two classes within the commercial lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans the three classes within the consumer lending segment are residential mortgages credit card loans and other retail loans the companys consumer lending segment utilizes several distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer credit including traditional branch lending mobile and online banking indirect lending alliance partnerships and correspondent banks each distinct underwriting and origination activity manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its loan production commensurate with the differing risk profiles residential mortgage originations are generally limited to prime borrowers and are performed through the companys branches loan production offices mobile and online services and a wholesale network of originators the company may retain residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance sheet or sell the loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights and customer relationships utilizing the secondary markets enables the company to effectively reduce its credit and other assetliability risks for residential mortgages that are retained in the companys portfolio and for home equity and second mortgages credit risk is managed by adherence to ltv and borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process the company estimates updated ltv information on its outstanding residential mortgages quarterly based on a method that combines automated valuation model updates and relevant home price indices ltv is the ratio of the loans outstanding principal balance to the current estimate of property value for home equity and second mortgages combined loantovalue cltv is the combination of the first mortgage original principal balance and the second lien outstanding principal balance relative to the current estimate of property value certain loans do not have an ltv or cltv primarily due to lack of availability of relevant automated valuation model andor home price indices values or lack of necessary valuation data on acquired

loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the nearterm in most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in interest rate extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance that would otherwise not be considered modified loans accrue interest if the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles which is generally six months or greater the company continues to work with customers to modify loans for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties many of the companys loan modifications are determined on a casebycase basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes the modifications vary within each of the companys loan classes commercial lending segment modifications generally include extensions of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase or decrease to the interest rate the company may also work with the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate losses such as obtaining additional collateral andor guarantees to support the loan the company has also implemented certain residential mortgage loan modification programs the company modifies residential mortgage loans under federal housing administration united states department of veterans affairs and its own internal programs under these programs the company offers qualifying homeowners the opportunity to permanently modify their loan and achieve more affordable monthly payments these modifications may include adjustments to interest rates conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates extensions of maturity dates or deferrals of payments capitalization of accrued interest andor outstanding advances or in limited situations partial forgiveness of loan principal in most instances participation in residential mortgage loan modification programs requires the customer to complete a shortterm trial period a permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer successfully completing the trial period arrangement and the loan documents are not modified until that time a b us bancorp credit card and other retail loan modifications are generally part of distinct modification programs providing customers modification solutions over a specified time period generally up to months the company also makes shortterm modifications in limited circumstances to assist borrowers experiencing temporary hardships shortterm consumer lending modification programs include payment reductions deferrals of up to three past due payments and the ability to return to current status if the borrower makes required payments the company may also make shortterm modifications to commercial lending loans with the most common modification being an extension of the maturity date of three months or less such extensions generally are used when the maturity date is imminent and the borrower is experiencing some level of financial stress but the company believes the borrower will pay all contractual amounts owed nonperforming assets the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans modified loans not performing in accordance with modified terms and not accruing interest modified loans that have not met the performance period required to return to accrual status other real estate owned oreo and

allowance for credit losses is established for current expected credit losses on the companys loan and lease portfolio including unfunded credit commitments the allowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives of the applicable assets inclusive of expected recoveries the allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net chargeoffs management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis multiple economic scenarios are considered over a threeyear reasonable and supportable forecast period which includes increasing consideration of historical loss experience over years two and three these economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses after the forecast period the company fully reverts to longterm historical loss experience adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and lease portfolio to estimate losses over the remaining life of the portfolio the economic scenarios are updated at least quarterly and are designed to provide a range of reasonable estimates from better to worse than current expectations scenarios are weighted based on the companys expectation of economic conditions for the foreseeable future and reflect significant judgment and consideration of economic forecast uncertainty final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses not reflected in the scenarios due to the unique aspects of current conditions and expectations these factors may include but are not limited to changes in borrower behavior or conditions in specific lending segments loan servicing practices regulatory guidance andor fiscal and monetary policy actions because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans the company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments which is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are included in the companys analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios the allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forwardlooking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors affecting lifetime credit losses these factors include but are not limited to macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates real estate prices gross domestic product levels inflation interest rates and corporate bond spreads as well as loan and borrower characteristics such as internal risk ratings on commercial loans and consumer credit scores delinquency status collateral type and us bancorp available valuation information consideration of endofterm losses on lease residuals and the remaining term of the loan adjusted for expected prepayments for each loan portfolio including those loans modified under various loan modification programs model estimates are adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition lending policies underwriting standards risk management practices economic conditions or other factors that may affect the accuracy of the model expected credit loss estimates also include consideration of expected cash recoveries on loans previously chargedoff or expected recoveries on collateraldependent loans where recovery is expected through sale of the collateral at fair value less selling costs where loans do not exhibit similar risk characteristics an individual analysis is performed to consider expected credit losses the allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans greater than million in the commercial lending segment is based on an analysis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral less selling costs for collateraldependent loans as appropriate when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position the company considers the delinquency and modification status of the first lien based on either servicing data for first lien accounts serviced by the company or the status of first lien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files when the first lien is not serviced by the company this information is considered within the overall assessment of economic conditions problem loans recent loss experience and other factors in determining the allowance for credit losses when a loan portfolio is purchased the acquired loans are divided into those considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration pcd and those not considered pcd an allowance is established for each population and considers product mix risk characteristics of the portfolio and delinquency status and refreshed ltv ratios when possible pcd loans also consider whether the loan has experienced a chargeoff bankruptcy or significant deterioration since origination the allowance established for purchased loans not considered pcd is recognized through provision expense upon acquisition whereas the allowance established for loans considered pcd at acquisition is offset by an increase in the basis of the acquired loans any subsequent increases and decreases in the allowance related to purchased loans regardless of pcd status are recognized through provision expense with chargeoffs charged to the allowance the company had a total net book balance of billion of pcd loans primarily related to the mub acquisition included in its loan portfolio at march the companys methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used and allocated to the various loan portfolios as a result amounts determined under the methodologies described above are adjusted by management to consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not captured in quantitative model adjustments which include but are not limited to the following model imprecision imprecision in economic scenario assumptions and emerging risks related to either changes in the economic environment that are affecting specific portfolios or changes in portfolio concentrations over time that may affect model performance the consideration of these items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the companys allowance for credit losses for each loan portfolio although the company determined the amount of each element of the allowance separately and considers this process to be an important credit management tool the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio the actual amount of losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts at march the allowance for credit losses was billion compared with an allowance of billion at december the million percent increase in the allowance for credit losses at march compared with december was primarily driven by credit migration in consumer and small business cards the company continued to monitor economic uncertainty related to high interest rates persistent inflationary pressures and other economic factors that affect the financial strength of corporate and consumer borrowers commercial real estate valuations were also affected by rising interest rates and the changing demand for office properties the company has monitored the commercial real estate office portfolio and established an allowance to loan coverage ratio of approximately percent at march and december in addition to these broad economic factors expected loss estimates considered various factors including customer specific information impacting changes in risk ratings projected delinquencies and the impact of economic deterioration on selected borrowers liquidity and ability to repay the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to periodend loans was percent at march compared with percent at december the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was percent at march compared with percent at december the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to annualized loan net chargeoffs was percent at march compared with percent of full year net chargeoffs at december economic conditions considered in estimating the allowance for credit losses

banking industry changes in interest rates are a significant risk that can impact earnings as well as the safety and soundness of an entity the company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by its asset liability management committee alco and approved by the board of directors the alco has the responsibility for approving and overseeing compliance with the alco management policies including interest rate risk exposure one way the company measures and analyzes its interest rate risk is through analysis of net interest income sensitivities across a range of scenarios net interest income sensitivity analysis includes evaluating all of the companys assets and liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments inclusive of new business activity under various interest rate scenarios that differ in the direction amount and speed of change over time as well as the overall shape of the yield curve the balance sheet includes assumptions regarding loan and deposit volumes and pricing which are based on quantitative analysis historical trends and management outlook and strategies deposit balances mix and pricing are dynamic across interest rate scenarios and will change both with the absolute level of rates as well as the assumed interest rate shock deposit pricing changes commonly referred to as the deposit beta represents the amount by which the companys interestbearing deposit rates have or will change given a change in shortterm market rates base case and net interest income sensitivities are reviewed monthly by the alco and are used to guide assetliability management strategies the company also manages interest rate sensitivity by utilizing market value of equity modeling which measures the degree to which the market values of the companys assets and liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments will change given a change in interest rates management measures the impact of changes in market values due to interest rates under a number of scenarios including immediate and sustained parallel shifts and flattening or steepening of the yield curve the company manages its interest rate risk position by holding assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its balance sheet executing certain pricing strategies for loans and deposits and deploying investment portfolio funding and derivative strategies table summarizes the projected impact to net interest income over the next months of various potential interest rate changes the sensitivity of the projected impact to net interest income over the next months is dependent on balance sheet growth product mix deposit behavior pricing and funding decisions from december to march interest rate sensitivity to higher rates decreased primarily due to changes in deposit composition and rates paid on deposits as a result of the elevated interest rate environment throughout the first quarter of as of march the company is relatively neutral to further parallel upward moves in interest rates while the sensitivity to lower rates has improved driven by the projected repricing of the deposit portfolio in declining rate scenarios while the company utilizes models and assumptions based on historical information and expected behaviors actual outcomes could vary significantly us bancorp table

income use of derivatives to manage interest rate and other risks to manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate prepayment credit price and foreign currency fluctuations asset and liability management positions the company enters into derivative transactions the company uses derivatives for asset and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways to convert fixedrate debt and availableforsale investment securities from fixedrate payments to floatingrate payments to convert floatingrate loans and debt from floatingrate payments to fixedrate payments to mitigate changes in value of the companys unfunded mortgage loan commitments funded mlhfs and msrs to mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances and to mitigate the volatility of the companys net investment in foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition the company enters into interest rate foreign exchange and commodity derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its customers customerrelated positions the company minimizes the market and liquidity risks of customerrelated positions by either entering into similar offsetting positions with brokerdealers or on a portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or nonderivative financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from these customerrelated positions the company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchangetraded centrally cleared through clearinghouses or overthecounter the company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes the company does not designate all of the derivatives that it enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges because of the inefficiency of applying the accounting requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the related hedged items in particular the company enters into interest rate swaps swaptions forward commitments to buy tobeannounced securities tbas us treasury and eurodollar futures and options on us treasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value of its msrs but does not designate those derivatives as accounting hedges refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding msrs including management of the changes in fair value additionally the company uses forward commitments to sell tbas and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at specified prices to economically hedge the interest rate risk in its residential mortgage loan production activities the forward commitments to sell and the unfunded mortgage loan commitments on loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives under the accounting guidance related to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities the company has elected the fair value option for the mlhfs derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the contracts credit risk associated with derivatives is measured by the company based on the probability of counterparty default the company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties by entering into master netting arrangements and where possible by requiring collateral arrangements the company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to third parties through the use of risk participation agreements in addition certain interest rate swaps interest rate forwards and credit contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk the company also mitigates the credit risk of its derivative positions as well as the credit risk on loans or lending portfolios through the use of credit contracts for additional information on derivatives and hedging activities refer to notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements market risk management in addition to interest rate risk the company is exposed to other forms of market risk principally related to trading activities which support customers strategies to manage their own foreign currency interest rate risk commodities risk and funding activities for purposes of its internal capital adequacy assessment process the company considers risk arising from its trading activities as well as the remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances included on its consolidated balance sheet collectively covered positions employing methodologies consistent with the requirements of regulatory rules for market risk the companys market risk committee mrc within the framework of the alco oversees market risk management the mrc monitors and reviews the companys covered positions and establishes policies for market risk management including exposure limits for each portfolio the company uses a var approach to measure general market risk theoretically var represents the statistical risk of loss the company has to adverse market movements over a oneday time horizon the company uses the historical simulation method to calculate var for its covered positions measured at the ninetyninth percentile using a oneyear lookback period for distributions derived from past market data the market factors used in the calculations include those pertinent to market risks inherent in the underlying trading portfolios principally those that affect the companys corporate bond trading business foreign currency transaction business client derivatives us bancorp business loan trading business and municipal securities business as well as those inherent in the companys foreign denominated balances and the derivatives used to mitigate the related measurement volatility on average the company expects the oneday var to be exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year related to these positions the company monitors the accuracy of internal var models and modeling processes by backtesting model performance regularly updating the historical data used by the var models and regular model validations to assess the accuracy of the models input processing and reporting components all models are required to be independently reviewed and approved prior to being placed in use if the company were to experience market losses in excess of the estimated var more often than expected the var models and associated assumptions would be analyzed and adjusted the average high low and periodend oneday var amounts for the companys covered positions were as follows three months ended march  in millions average high low periodend the company did not experience any actual losses for its combined covered positions that exceeded var during the three months ended march and the company stress tests its market risk measurements to provide management with perspectives on market events that may not be captured by its var models including worst case historical market movement combinations that have not necessarily occurred on the same date the company calculates stressed var using the same underlying methodology and model as var except that a historical continuous oneyear lookback period is utilized that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the companys covered positions the period selected by the company includes the significant market volatility of the last four months of the average high low and periodend oneday stressed var amounts for the companys covered positions were as follows three months ended march  in millions average high low periodend valuations of positions in client derivatives and foreign currency activities are based on discounted cash flow or other valuation techniques using marketbased assumptions these valuations are compared to thirdparty quotes or other market prices to determine if there are significant variances significant variances are approved by senior management in the companys corporate functions valuation of positions in the corporate bond trading loan trading and municipal securities businesses are based on trader marks these trader marks are evaluated against thirdparty prices with significant variances approved by senior management in the companys corporate functions the company also measures the market risk of its hedging activities related to residential mlhfs and msrs using the historical simulation method the vars are measured at the ninetyninth percentile and employ factors pertinent to the market risks inherent in the valuation of the assets and hedges a oneyear lookback period is used to obtain past market data for the models the average high and low var amounts for the residential mlhfs and related hedges and the msrs and related hedges were as follows three months ended march  in millions residential mortgage loans held for sale and related hedges average high low mortgage servicing rights and related hedges average high low liquidity risk management the companys liquidity risk management process is designed to identify measure and manage the companys funding and liquidity risk to meet its daily funding needs and to address expected and unexpected changes in its funding requirements the company engages in various activities to manage its liquidity risk these activities include diversifying its funding sources stress testing and holding readilymarketable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity if needed in addition the companys profitable operations sound credit quality and strong credit ratings and capital position have enabled it to develop a large and reliable base of core deposit funding within its market areas and in domestic and global capital markets the companys board of directors approves the companys liquidity policy the risk management committee of the companys board of directors oversees the companys liquidity risk management process and approves a contingency funding plan the alco reviews the companys liquidity policy and limits and regularly assesses the companys ability to meet funding requirements arising from adverse companyspecific or market events the company regularly projects its funding needs under various stress scenarios and maintains a contingency funding plan consistent with the companys access to diversified sources of contingent funding the company maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet funding sources these liquidity sources include cash at the federal reserve bank and certain european central banks unencumbered liquid assets and capacity to borrow from the federal home loan bank fhlb and at the federal reserve banks discount window unencumbered liquid us bancorp assets in the companys investment securities portfolio provide asset liquidity through the companys ability to sell the securities or pledge and borrow against them refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and balance sheet analysis for further information on investment securities maturities and trends asset liquidity is further enhanced by the companys practice of pledging loans to access secured borrowing facilities through the fhlb and federal reserve bank the following table summarizes the companys total available liquidity from onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet funding sources dollars in millions march december cash held at the federal reserve bank and other central banks available investment securities borrowing capacity from the federal reserve bank and fhlb total available liquidity borrowing capacity from the federal reserve bank and fhlb declined from december to march primarily due to the expiration of the federal reserve banks bank term funding program btfp this decline was partially offset by an increase in available investment securities as a portion of the securities previously pledged through the btfp were made available for sale or pledging cash increased from december primarily driven by customer deposit inflows the companys diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and lowcost funding while reducing the companys reliance on the wholesale markets total deposits were billion at march compared with billion at december average first quarter noninterestbearing deposit balances reflected decreases of percent and percent compared with the first quarter of and fourth quarter of respectively these decreases reflected the continuing shift of noninterestbearing balances

longterm debt was billion at march and is an important funding source because of its multiyear borrowing structure shortterm borrowings were billion at march and supplement the companys other funding sources refer to balance sheet analysis for further information on the companys longterm debt and shortterm borrowings in addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis the company monitors the parent companys liquidity the parent companys routine funding requirements consist primarily of operating expenses dividends paid to shareholders debt service repurchases of common stock and funds used for acquisitions the parent company obtains funding to meet its obligations from dividends collected from its subsidiaries and the issuance of debt and capital securities the company establishes limits for the minimal number of months into the future where the parent company can meet existing and forecasted obligations with cash and securities held that can be readily monetized the company measures and manages this limit in both normal and adverse conditions the company maintains sufficient funding to meet expected capital and debt service obligations for months without the support of dividends from subsidiaries and assuming access to the wholesale markets is maintained the company maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its capital and debt service obligations for months under adverse conditions without the support of dividends from subsidiaries or access to the wholesale markets the parent company is currently in excess of required liquidity minimums at march parent company longterm debt outstanding was billion compared with billion at december the increase was primarily due to billion of mediumterm note issuances partially offset by billion of mediumterm note

useful additional methods of evaluating the companys utilization of its capital held and the level of capital available to withstand unexpected negative market or economic conditions additionally presentation of these measures allows investors analysts and banking regulators to assess the companys capital position relative to other financial services companies these capital measures are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles gaap or are not currently effective or defined in banking regulations in addition certain of these measures differ from currently effective capital ratios defined by banking regulations principally in that the currently effective ratios which are subject to certain transitional provisions temporarily exclude the impact of the adoption of
