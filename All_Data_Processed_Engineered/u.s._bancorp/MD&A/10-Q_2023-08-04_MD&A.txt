successfully operating a financial services company the companys board of directors has approved a risk management framework which establishes governance and risk management requirements for all risktaking activities this framework includes company and business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing business objectives and initiatives the board of directors primarily through its risk management committee oversees performance relative to the risk management framework risk appetite statements and other policy requirements the executive risk committee erc which is chaired by the chief risk officer and includes the chief executive officer and other members of the executive management team oversees execution against the risk management framework and risk appetite statements the erc focuses on current and emerging risks including strategic and reputation risks by directing timely and comprehensive actions senior operating committees have also been established each responsible for overseeing a specified category of risk upon closing of the mub acquisition the companys risk management framework applied to the legal entities acquired from mufg including mub up us bancorp table of contents until its merger into usbna updates were made to align the acquired entities with the companys risk appetite and connect the elements of their respective risk governance and reporting into the companys existing risk management framework upon completing the merger of mub into usbna which occurred on may the mub risk governance and reporting framework is no longer applicable the companys most prominent risk exposures are credit interest rate market liquidity operational compliance strategic and reputation credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a change in the credit profile or the failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its contractual obligations interest rate risk is the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital or market valuations arising from the impact of changes in interest rates market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates foreign exchange rates and security prices that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments such as trading and availableforsale securities mortgage loans held for sale mlhfs

factors exist that may impact the company refer to risk factors in the companys annual report on s the risk management committee oversees the companys credit risk management process in addition credit quality ratings as defined by the company are an important part of the companys overall credit risk management and evaluation of its allowance for credit losses loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on the companys rating scale for problem credits as minimal credit risk has been identified loans with a special mention or classified rating including consumer lending and small business loans that are days or more past due and still accruing nonaccrual loans and loans in a junior lien position that are current but are behind a first lien position on nonaccrual encompass all loans held by the company that it considers to have a potential or welldefined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk the companys internal credit quality ratings for consumer loans are primarily based on delinquency and nonperforming status except for a limited population of larger loans within those portfolios that are individually evaluated for this limited population the determination of the internal credit quality rating may also consider collateral value and customer cash flows refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys loan portfolios including internal credit quality ratings in addition refer to managements discussion and analysis credit risk management in the companys annual report on s and other macroeconomic factors customer payment history and credit scores and in some cases updated loantovalue ltv information reflecting current market conditions on real estatebased loans these and other risk characteristics are reflected in forecasts of delinquency levels bankruptcies and losses which are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for the consumer lending segment the company further disaggregates its loan portfolio segments into various classes based on their underlying risk characteristics the two classes within the commercial lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans the three classes within the consumer lending segment are residential mortgages credit card loans and other retail loans the companys consumer lending segment utilizes several distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer credit including traditional branch lending mobile and online banking indirect lending alliance partnerships and correspondent banks each distinct underwriting and origination activity manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its loan production commensurate with the differing risk profiles residential mortgage originations are generally limited to prime borrowers and are performed through the companys branches loan production offices mobile and online services and a wholesale network of originators the company may retain residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance sheet or sell the loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights and customer relationships utilizing the secondary markets enables the company to effectively reduce its credit and other assetliability risks for residential mortgages that are retained in the companys portfolio and for home equity and second mortgages credit risk is managed by adherence to ltv and borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process the company estimates updated ltv information on its outstanding residential mortgages quarterly based on a method that combines automated valuation model updates and relevant home price indices ltv is the ratio of the loans outstanding principal balance to the current estimate of property value for home equity and second mortgages combined loantovalue cltv is the combination of the first mortgage original principal balance and the second lien outstanding principal balance relative to the current estimate of property value certain loans do not have an ltv or cltv primarily due to lack of availability of

revolving credit installment and automobile loans us bancorp table of contents modified loans in certain circumstances the company may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the nearterm in most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in interest rate extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance that would otherwise not be considered modified loans accrue interest if the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles which is generally six months or greater the company continues to work with customers to modify loans for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties many of the companys loan modifications are determined on a casebycase basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes the modifications vary within each of the companys loan classes commercial lending segment modifications generally include extensions of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase or decrease to the interest rate the company may also work with the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate losses such as obtaining additional collateral andor guarantees to support the loan the company has also implemented certain residential mortgage loan modification programs the company modifies residential mortgage loans under federal housing administration united states department of veterans affairs and its own internal programs under these programs the company offers qualifying homeowners the opportunity to permanently modify their loan and achieve more affordable monthly payments these modifications may include adjustments to interest rates conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates extensions of maturity dates or deferrals of payments capitalization of accrued interest andor outstanding advances or in limited situations partial forgiveness of loan principal in most instances participation in residential mortgage loan modification programs requires the customer to complete a shortterm trial period a permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer successfully completing the trial period arrangement and the loan documents are not modified until that time credit card and other retail loan modifications are generally part of distinct modification programs providing customers modification solutions over a specified time period generally up to months the company also makes shortterm modifications in limited circumstances to assist borrowers experiencing temporary hardships including previously offering payment relief to borrowers that experienced financial hardship resulting directly from the effects of the covid19 pandemic shortterm consumer lending modification programs include payment reductions deferrals of up to three past due payments and the ability to return to current status if the borrower makes required payments the company may also make shortterm modifications to commercial lending loans with the most common modification being an extension of the maturity date of three months or less such extensions generally are used when the maturity date is imminent and the borrower is experiencing some level of financial stress but the company believes the borrower will pay all contractual amounts owed nonperforming assets the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans modified loans not performing in accordance with modified terms and not accruing interest

established for current expected credit losses on the companys loan and us bancorp table of contents lease portfolio including unfunded credit commitments the allowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives of the applicable assets inclusive of expected recoveries the allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net chargeoffs management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis multiple economic scenarios are considered over a threeyear reasonable and supportable forecast period which includes increasing consideration of historical loss experience over years two and three these economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses after the forecast period the company fully reverts to longterm historical loss experience adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and lease portfolio to estimate losses over the remaining life of the portfolio the economic scenarios are updated at least quarterly and are designed to provide a range of reasonable estimates from better to worse than current expectations scenarios are weighted based on the companys expectation of economic conditions for the foreseeable future and reflect significant judgment and consideration of economic forecast uncertainty final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses not reflected in the scenarios due to the unique aspects of current conditions and expectations these factors may include but are not limited to loan servicing practices regulatory guidance andor fiscal and monetary policy actions because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans the company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments which is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are included in the companys analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios the allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forwardlooking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors affecting lifetime credit losses these factors include but are not limited to macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates real estate prices gross domestic product levels inflation interest rates and corporate bond spreads as well as loan and borrower characteristics such as internal risk ratings on commercial loans and consumer credit scores delinquency status collateral type and available valuation information consideration of endofterm losses on lease residuals and the remaining term of the loan adjusted for expected prepayments for each loan portfolio including those loans modified under various loan modification programs model estimates are adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition lending policies underwriting standards risk management practices economic conditions or other factors that may affect the accuracy of the model expected credit loss estimates also include consideration of expected cash recoveries on loans previously chargedoff or expected recoveries on collateraldependent loans where recovery is expected through sale of the collateral at fair value less selling costs where loans do not exhibit similar risk characteristics an individual analysis is performed to consider expected credit losses the allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans greater than million in the commercial lending segment is based on an analysis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral less selling costs for collateraldependent loans as appropriate when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position the company considers the delinquency and modification status of the first lien at june the company serviced the first lien on percent of the home equity loans and lines in a junior lien position the company also considers the status of first lien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files when the first lien is not serviced by the company regardless of whether the company services the first lien an assessment is made of economic conditions problem loans recent loss experience and other factors in determining the allowance for credit losses based on the available information the company estimated million or percent of its total home equity portfolio at june represented nondelinquent junior liens where the first lien was delinquent or modified when a loan portfolio is purchased the acquired loans are divided into those considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration pcd and those not considered pcd an allowance is established for each population and considers product mix risk characteristics of the portfolio and delinquency status and refreshed ltv ratios when possible pcd loans also consider whether the loan has experienced a chargeoff bankruptcy or significant deterioration since origination the allowance established for purchased loans not considered pcd is recognized through provision expense upon acquisition whereas the allowance established for loans considered pcd at acquisition is offset by an increase in the basis of the acquired loans any subsequent increases and decreases in the allowance related to purchased loans regardless of pcd status are recognized through provision expense us bancorp table of contents with chargeoffs charged to the allowance the company had a total unpaid principal balance of billion of pcd loans primarily related to the mub acquisition included in its loan portfolio at june the companys methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used and allocated to the various loan portfolios as a result amounts determined under the methodologies described above are adjusted by management to consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not captured in quantitative model adjustments which include but are not limited to the following model imprecision imprecision in economic scenario assumptions and emerging risks related to either changes in the economic environment that are affecting specific portfolios or changes in portfolio concentrations over time that may affect model performance the consideration of these items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the companys allowance for credit losses for each loan portfolio although the company determined the amount of each element of the allowance separately and considers this process to be an important credit management tool the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio the actual amount of losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts at june the allowance for credit losses was billion percent of periodend loans compared with an allowance of billion percent of periodend loans at december the allowance for credit losses at june included a million decrease due to a change in accounting principle related to discontinuing the separate recognition and measurement of troubled debt restructurings the increase in the allowance for credit losses at june compared with december was primarily driven by increasing economic uncertainty and normalizing credit losses as well as adjustments made to the purchase accounting estimate for pcd loans economic uncertainty and recession risk have been increasing due to rising interest rates inflationary concerns market volatility and pressure on corporate earnings related to these factors in addition to these broad economic factors expected loss estimates consider various factors including customer specific information impacting changes in risk ratings projected delinquencies and the impact of economic deterioration on selected borrowers liquidity and ability to repay the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was percent at june compared with percent at december the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to annualized loan net chargeoffs was percent at june compared with percent of full year net charge offs at december economic conditions considered in estimating the allowance for credit losses at june included changes in projected gross domestic product and unemployment levels these factors are evaluated through a combination of quantitative calculations using multiple economic scenarios and additional qualitative assessments that consider the high degree of economic uncertainty in the current environment the projected unemployment rates for considered in the estimate range from percent to percent the following table

directors the alco has the responsibility for approving and overseeing compliance with the alco management policies including interest rate risk exposure one way the company measures and analyzes its interest rate risk is through net interest income simulation analysis simulation analysis incorporates substantially all of the companys assets and liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments together with forecasted changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment through this simulation management estimates the impact on net interest income of various interest rate changes that differ in the direction amount and speed of change over time as well as the shape of the yield curve this simulation includes assumptions about how the balance

repricing strategies these assumptions are reviewed and validated on a periodic basis with sensitivity analysis being provided for key variables of the simulation the results are reviewed monthly by the alco and are used to guide assetliability management strategies the company manages its interest rate risk position by holding assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its balance sheet implementing certain pricing strategies for loans and deposits and selecting derivatives and various funding and investment portfolio strategies the company also manages interest rate sensitivity by utilizing market value of equity modeling which measures the degree to which the market values of the companys assets and liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments will change given

on a percentage basis use of derivatives to manage interest rate and other risks to manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate prepayment credit price and foreign currency fluctuations asset and liability management positions the company enters into derivative transactions the company uses derivatives for asset and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways to convert fixedrate debt and availableforsale investment securities from fixedrate payments to floatingrate payments to convert floatingrate loans and debt from floatingrate payments to fixedrate payments to mitigate changes in value of the companys unfunded mortgage loan commitments funded mlhfs and msrs to mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances and to mitigate the volatility of the companys net investment in foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition the company enters into interest rate foreign exchange and commodity derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its customers customerrelated positions the company minimizes the market and liquidity risks of customerrelated positions by either entering into similar offsetting positions with brokerdealers or on a portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or nonderivative financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from these customerrelated positions the company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchangetraded centrally cleared through clearinghouses or overthecounter the company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes the company does not designate all of the derivatives that it enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges because of the inefficiency of applying the accounting requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the related hedged items in particular the company enters into interest rate swaps swaptions forward commitments to buy tobeannounced securities tbas us treasury and eurodollar futures and options on us treasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value of its msrs but does not designate those derivatives as accounting hedges additionally the company uses forward commitments to sell tbas and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at specified prices to economically hedge the interest rate risk in its residential mortgage loan production activities the forward commitments to sell and the unfunded mortgage loan commitments on loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives under the accounting guidance related to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities the company has elected the fair value option for the mlhfs derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the contracts credit risk associated with derivatives is measured by the company based on the probability of counterparty default the company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties by entering into master netting arrangements and where possible by requiring collateral arrangements the company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to third parties through the use of risk participation agreements in addition certain interest rate swaps interest rate forwards and credit contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk the company may mitigate credit
