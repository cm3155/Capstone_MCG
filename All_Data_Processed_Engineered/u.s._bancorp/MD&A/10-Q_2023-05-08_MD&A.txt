all risktaking activities this framework includes company and business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing business objectives and initiatives the board of directors primarily through its risk management committee oversees performance relative to the risk management framework risk appetite statements and other policy requirements the executive risk committee erc which is chaired by the chief risk officer and includes the chief executive officer and other members of the executive management team oversees execution against the risk management framework and risk appetite statements the erc focuses on current and emerging risks including strategic and reputation risks by directing timely and

management framework applies to the legal entities acquired from mitsubishi ufj financial group inc including mub prior to closing the company evaluated the frameworks policies and procedures of the acquired entities as necessary updates were made to align the acquired entities with the companys risk appetite and connect the elements of their respective risk governance and reporting into the companys existing risk management framework connecting the existing mub risk governance and reporting framework into the companys existing risk management framework allows separate risk profiles governance and reporting for the company and the acquired entities during the period from acquisition through bank merger while also providing the ability to consolidate reporting for the company upon

prospective risk to earnings and capital or market valuations arising from the impact of changes in interest rates market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates foreign exchange rates and security prices that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments such as trading and availableforsale securities mortgage loans held for sale mlhfs msrs and derivatives that are

nonaccrual encompass all loans held by the company that it considers to have a potential or welldefined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk the companys internal credit quality ratings for consumer loans are primarily based on delinquency and nonperforming status except for a limited population of larger loans within those portfolios that are individually evaluated for this limited population the determination of the internal credit quality rating may also consider collateral value and customer cash flows refer to note in the notes to consolidated

credit losses for the consumer lending segment the company further disaggregates its loan portfolio segments into various classes based on their underlying risk characteristics the two classes within the commercial lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans the three classes within the consumer lending segment are residential mortgages credit card loans and other retail loans the companys consumer lending segment utilizes several distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer credit including traditional branch lending mobile and online banking indirect lending alliance partnerships and correspondent banks each distinct underwriting and origination activity manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its loan production commensurate with the differing risk profiles us bancorp table of contents residential mortgage originations are generally limited to prime borrowers and are performed through the companys branches loan production offices mobile and online services and a wholesale network of originators the company may retain residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance sheet or sell the loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights and customer relationships utilizing the secondary markets enables the company to effectively reduce its credit and other assetliability risks for residential mortgages that are retained in the companys portfolio and for home equity and second mortgages credit risk is managed by adherence to ltv and borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process the company estimates updated ltv information on its outstanding residential mortgages quarterly based on a method that combines automated valuation model updates and relevant

revolving credit installment and automobile loans modified loans in certain circumstances the company may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the nearterm in most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in interest rate extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance that would otherwise not be considered modified loans accrue interest if the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles which is generally six months or greater the company continues to work with customers to modify loans for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties many of the companys loan modifications are determined on a casebycase basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes the modifications vary within each of the companys loan classes commercial lending segment modifications generally include extensions of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase or decrease to the interest rate the company may also work with the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate losses such as obtaining additional collateral andor guarantees to support the loan the company has also implemented certain residential mortgage loan modification programs the company modifies residential mortgage loans under federal housing administration united states department of veterans affairs and its own internal programs under these programs the company offers qualifying homeowners the opportunity to permanently modify their loan and achieve more affordable monthly payments these modifications may include adjustments to interest rates conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates extensions of maturity dates or deferrals of payments capitalization of accrued interest andor outstanding advances or in limited situations partial forgiveness of loan principal in most instances participation in residential mortgage loan modification programs requires the customer to complete a shortterm trial period a permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer successfully completing the trial period arrangement and the loan documents are not modified until that time credit card and other retail loan modifications are generally part of distinct modification programs providing customers modification solutions over a us bancorp table of

offering payment relief to borrowers that experienced financial hardship resulting directly from the effects of the covid19 pandemic shortterm consumer lending modification programs include payment reductions deferrals of up to three past due payments and the ability to return to current status if the borrower makes required payments the company may also make shortterm modifications to commercial lending loans with the most common modification being an extension of the maturity date of three months or less such extensions generally are used when the maturity date is imminent and the borrower is experiencing some level of financial stress but the company believes the borrower will pay all contractual amounts owed nonperforming assets the level of nonperforming assets represents

for credit losses is established for current expected credit losses on the companys loan and lease portfolio including unfunded credit commitments the allowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives of the applicable assets inclusive of expected recoveries the allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net chargeoffs management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis multiple economic scenarios are considered over a threeyear reasonable and supportable forecast period which includes increasing consideration of historical loss experience over years two and three these economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses after the forecast period the company fully reverts to longterm historical loss experience adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and lease portfolio to estimate losses over the remaining life of the portfolio the economic scenarios are updated at least quarterly and are designed to provide a range of reasonable estimates from better to worse than current expectations scenarios are weighted based on the companys expectation of economic conditions for the foreseeable future and reflect significant judgment and consideration of economic forecast uncertainty final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses not reflected in the scenarios due to the unique aspects of current conditions and expectations these factors may include but are not limited to loan servicing practices regulatory guidance andor fiscal and monetary policy actions because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans the company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments which is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are included in the companys analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios the allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forwardlooking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors affecting lifetime credit losses these factors include but are not limited to macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates real estate prices gross domestic product levels inflation

variables of the simulation the results are reviewed monthly by the alco and are used to guide assetliability management strategies the company manages its interest rate risk position by holding assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its balance sheet implementing certain pricing strategies for loans and deposits and selecting derivatives and various funding and investment portfolio strategies the company also manages interest rate sensitivity by utilizing market value of equity modeling which measures the degree to which the market values of the companys assets and

price and foreign currency fluctuations asset and liability management positions the company enters into derivative transactions the company uses derivatives for asset and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways to convert fixedrate debt and availableforsale investment securities from fixedrate payments to floatingrate payments to convert floatingrate loans and debt from floatingrate payments to fixedrate payments to mitigate changes in value of the companys unfunded mortgage loan commitments funded mlhfs and msrs to mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign
