payment rates these decreases were partially offset by higher other retail loans driven by growth in installment loans due to strong auto and recreational vehicle lending partially offset by lower home equity and second mortgages as more customers chose to refinance their existing first lien residential mortgage balances during the prior year due to the low interest rate environment in addition residential mortgages were higher due to increased loan portfolio production and slower payoffs in the mortgage portfolio average deposit balances in increased billion percent over primarily due to

the covid19 pandemic are reflected in forecasts of delinquency levels bankruptcies and losses which are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for the consumer lending segment the company further disaggregates its loan portfolio segments into various classes based on their underlying risk characteristics the two classes within the commercial lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans the three classes within the consumer lending segment are residential mortgages credit card loans and other retail loans because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans the company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments the company also engages in nonlending activities that may give rise to credit risk including derivative transactions for balance sheet hedging purposes foreign exchange transactions deposit overdrafts and interest rate contracts for customers investments in securities and other financial assets and settlement risk including automated clearing house transactions and the processing of credit card transactions for merchants these activities are subject to credit review analysis and approval processes economic and other factors in evaluating its credit risk the company considers changes if any in underwriting activities the loan portfolio composition including product mix and geographic industry or customerspecific concentrations collateral values trends in loan performance and macroeconomic factors such as changes in unemployment rates gross domestic product levels and consumer bankruptcy filings as well as the potential impact on customers and the domestic economy resulting from the covid19 pandemic during the first half of the covid19 pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place by companies consumers and governmental authorities to contain it created the most severe negative impact to the domestic economy since the great depression during factors affecting economic conditions including the enactment of additional benefits from government stimulus programs and broad vaccine availability in the united states have contributed to economic improvement as a result economic projections for both the gross domestic product and unemployment levels improved from the prior year however economic uncertainty remains associated with supply chain concerns rising inflationary concerns and additional virus variants credit diversification the company manages its credit risk in part through diversification of its loan portfolio which is achieved through limit setting by product type criteria such as industry and identification of credit concentrations as part of its normal business activities the company offers a broad array of traditional commercial lending products and specialized products such as assetbased lending commercial lease financing agricultural credit warehouse mortgage lending small business lending commercial real estate lending health care lending and correspondent banking financing the company also offers an array of consumer lending products including residential mortgages credit card loans auto loans retail leases home equity loans and lines revolving credit arrangements and other consumer loans these consumer lending products are primarily offered through the branch office network home mortgage and loan production offices mobile and online banking and indirect distribution channels such as auto and recreational vehicle dealers the company monitors and manages the portfolio diversification by industry customer and geography table provides information with respect to the overall product diversification and changes in the mix during the commercial loan class is diversified among various industries with higher concentrations in real estate and financial institutions additionally the commercial loan class is diversified across the companys geographical markets with a higher concentration in california table provides a summary of significant industry groups and geographical locations of commercial loans outstanding at december and the commercial real estate loan class reflects the companys focus on serving business owners within states encompassing its branch office network as well as regional and national investmentbased real estate owners and builders within the commercial real estate loan class different property types have varying degrees of credit risk table provides a summary of the significant property types and geographical locations of commercial real estate loans outstanding at december and at december approximately percent of the commercial real estate loans represented business owner occupied properties that tend to exhibit less credit risk than non owneroccupied properties the investmentbased real estate mortgages are diversified among various property types with somewhat higher concentrations in multifamily office industrial and retail properties from a geographical perspective the companys commercial real estate loan class is generally well diversified with a higher concentration in california the companys consumer lending segment utilizes several distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer credit including traditional branch lending mobile and online banking indirect lending alliance partnerships and correspondent banks each distinct underwriting and origination activity manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its loan production commensurate with the differing risk profiles residential mortgage originations are generally limited to prime borrowers and are performed through the companys branches loan production offices mobile and online services and a wholesale network of originators the company may retain residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance sheet or sell the loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights and customer relationships utilizing the secondary markets enables the company to effectively reduce its credit and other assetliability risks for residential mortgages that are retained in the companys portfolio and for home equity and second mortgages credit risk is also diversified by geography and managed by adherence to ltv and borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process the company estimates updated ltv information on its outstanding residential mortgages quarterly based on a method that combines automated valuation model updates and relevant home price indices ltv is the ratio of the loans outstanding principal balance to the current estimate of property value for home equity and second mortgages combined loantovalue cltv is the combination of the first mortgage original principal balance and the second lien outstanding principal balance relative to the current estimate of property value certain loans do not have an ltv or cltv primarily due to lack of availability of relevant automated valuation model andor home price indices values or lack of necessary valuation data

loan portfolios the entire balance of a loan account is considered delinquent if the minimum payment contractually required to be made is not received by the date specified on the billing statement the company measures delinquencies both including and excluding nonperforming loans to enable comparability with other companies delinquent loans purchased from gnma mortgage pools whose repayments are primarily insured by the federal housing administration or guaranteed by the united states department of veterans affairs are excluded from delinquency statistics in addition in certain situations a consumer lending customers account may be reaged to remove it from delinquent status generally the purpose of reaging accounts is to assist customers who have recently overcome temporary financial difficulties and have demonstrated both the ability and willingness to resume regular payments in addition the company may reage the consumer lending account of a customer who has experienced longerterm financial difficulties and apply modified concessionary terms and conditions to the account commercial lending loans are generally not subject to reaging policies accruing loans days or more past due totaled million at december compared with million at december accruing loans days or more past due are not included in nonperforming assets and continue to accrue interest because they

automobile and student loans restructured loans in certain circumstances the company may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the nearterm in most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in interest rate extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance that would otherwise not be considered troubled debt restructurings concessionary modifications are classified as tdrs unless the modification results in only an insignificant delay in the payments to be received tdrs accrue interest if the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles which is generally six months or greater at december performing tdrs were billion compared with billion at december the company continues to work with customers to modify loans for borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties many of the companys tdrs are determined on a casebycase basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes the modifications vary within each of the companys loan classes commercial lending segment tdrs generally include extensions of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase or decrease to the interest rate the company may also work with the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate losses such as obtaining additional collateral andor guarantees to support the loan the company has also implemented certain residential mortgage loan restructuring programs that may result in tdrs the company modifies residential mortgage loans under federal housing administration united states department of veterans affairs and its own internal programs under these programs the company offers qualifying homeowners the opportunity to permanently modify their loan and achieve more affordable monthly payments by providing loan concessions these concessions may include adjustments to interest rates conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates extensions of maturity dates or deferrals of payments capitalization of accrued interest andor outstanding advances or in limited situations partial forgiveness of loan principal in most instances participation in residential mortgage loan restructuring programs requires the customer to complete a shortterm trial period a permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer successfully completing the trial period arrangement and the loan documents are not modified until that time the company reports loans in a trial period arrangement as tdrs and continues to report them as tdrs after the trial period credit card and other retail loan tdrs are generally part of distinct restructuring programs providing customers modification solutions over a specified time period generally up to months in accordance with regulatory guidance the company considers secured consumer loans that have had debt discharged through bankruptcy where the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt to be tdrs if the loan amount exceeds the collateral value the loan is charged down to collateral value and the remaining amount is reported as nonperforming loan modifications or concessions granted to customers resulting directly from the effects of the covid19 pandemic who were otherwise in current payment status are not considered to be tdrs the following table provides a summary of tdrs by loan class including the delinquency

maturity date of three months or less such extensions generally are used when the maturity date is imminent and the borrower is experiencing some level of financial stress but the company believes the borrower will pay all contractual amounts owed covid19 payment relief the company has offered payment relief including forbearance payment deferrals and other customer accommodations to assist borrowers that have experienced financial hardship resulting from the effects of the covid19 pandemic the majority of these borrowers were not delinquent on payments at the time they received the payment relief most of the borrowers who received account modifications are no longer participating in these payment relief programs as the programs are generally shortterm at december less than

improving economic conditions the company expects net chargeoffs to return to more normalized levels over time analysis and determination of the allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is established for current expected credit losses on the companys loan and lease portfolio including unfunded credit commitments the allowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives of the applicable assets inclusive of expected recoveries the allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net chargeoffs management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis multiple economic scenarios are considered over a threeyear reasonable and supportable forecast period which includes increasing consideration of historical loss experience over years two and three these economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses after the forecast period the company fully reverts to longterm historical loss experience adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and lease portfolio to estimate losses over the remaining life of the portfolio the economic scenarios are updated at least quarterly and are designed to provide a range of reasonable estimates from better to worse than current expectations scenarios are weighted based on the companys expectation of economic conditions for the foreseeable future and reflect significant judgment and consideration of uncertainties that exist final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses not reflected in the scenarios due to the unique aspects of current conditions and expectations these factors may include but are not limited to loan servicing practices regulatory guidance andor fiscal and monetary policy actions because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans the company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments which is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are included in the companys analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios the allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forward looking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors affecting lifetime credit losses these factors include but are not limited to macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates real estate prices gross domestic product levels and corporate bonds spreads as well as loan and borrower characteristics such as internal risk ratings on commercial loans and consumer credit scores delinquency status collateral type and available valuation information consideration of endofterm losses on lease residuals and the remaining term of the loan adjusted for expected prepayments for each loan portfolio model estimates are adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition lending policies underwriting standards risk management practices economic conditions or other factors that may affect the accuracy of the model expected credit loss estimates also include consideration of expected cash recoveries on loans previously chargedoff or expected recoveries on collateraldependent loans where recovery is expected through sale of the collateral where loans do not exhibit similar risk characteristics an individual analysis is performed to consider expected credit losses the allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans greater than million in the commercial lending segment is based on an analysis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral less selling costs for collateraldependent loans as appropriate for commercial tdrs individually evaluated for impairment attributes of the borrower are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses however historical loss experience is also incorporated into the allowance methodology applied to this category of loans commercial lending segment tdr loans may be collectively evaluated for impairment where observed performance history including defaults is a primary driver of the loss allocation the allowance recorded for tdr loans in the consumer lending segment is determined on a homogenous pool basis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate of the pool the expected cash flows on tdr loans consider subsequent payment defaults since modification the borrowers ability to pay under the restructured terms and the timing and amount of payments the allowance for collateraldependent loans in the consumer lending segment is determined based on the current fair value of the collateral less costs to sell when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position the company considers the delinquency and modification status of the first lien at december the company serviced the first lien on percent of the home equity loans and lines in a junior lien position the company also considers the status of first lien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files when the first lien is not serviced by the company regardless of whether the company services the first lien an assessment is made of economic conditions problem loans recent loss experience and other factors in determining the allowance for credit losses based on the available information the company estimated million or percent of its total home equity portfolio at december represented nondelinquent junior liens where the first lien was delinquent or modified excluding loans in covidrelated forbearance programs the company considers historical loss experience on the loans and lines in a junior lien position to establish loss estimates for junior lien loans and lines the company services that are current but the first lien is delinquent or modified the historical longterm average loss experience related to junior liens has been relatively limited less than percent of the total portfolio annually and estimates are adjusted to consider current collateral support and portfolio risk characteristics these include updated credit scores and collateral estimates obtained on the companys home equity portfolio each quarter in its evaluation of the allowance for credit losses the company also considers the increased risk of loss associated with home equity lines that are contractually scheduled to convert from a revolving status to a fully amortizing payment beginning january when a loan portfolio is purchased the acquired loans are divided into those considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration pcd and those not considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration an allowance is established for each population and considers product mix risk characteristics of the portfolio bankruptcy experience delinquency status and refreshed ltv ratios when possible the allowance established for purchased loans not considered pcd is recognized through provision expense upon acquisition whereas the allowance established for loans considered pcd at acquisition is offset by an increase in the basis of the acquired loans any subsequent increases and decreases in the allowance related to purchased loans regardless of pcd status are recognized through provision expense with chargeoffs charged to the allowance the company did not have a material amount of pcd loans included in its loan portfolio at december the companys methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used and allocated to the various loan portfolios as a result amounts determined under the methodologies described above are adjusted by management to consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not captured in quantitative model adjustments which include but are not limited to the following model imprecision imprecision in economic scenario assumptions and emerging risks related to either changes in the economic environment that are affecting specific portfolios or changes in portfolio concentrations over time that may affect model performance the consideration of these items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the

from government stimulus programs and broad vaccine availability in the united states that has reduced the risks associated with covid19 contributing to an economic recovery however economic uncertainty remains associated with supply chain concerns rising inflationary concerns and additional virus variants in addition to these factors expected loss estimates consider various factors including customer specific information impacting changes in risk ratings projected delinquencies and potential effects of diminishing liquidity without support of mortgage forbearance and direct federal stimulus consumer credit trends continued to perform better than expected in while select wholesale portfolios continue to be monitored for pandemic related impacts changes in economic conditions considered in estimating the allowance for credit losses at december included improvements in projected gross domestic product and unemployment levels which reflected the additional government stimulus and availability of vaccines these factors are evaluated through a combination of quantitative calculations using economic scenarios and qualitative assessments that consider the

conditions and expectations including for unemployment and gross domestic product among other factors based on economic conditions at december it was difficult to estimate the length and severity of the longer term effects on certain industry sectors that may result from covid19 and the impact of other factors that may influence the level of eventual losses and corresponding requirements for the

on form 10k for further discussion of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries interest rate risk management in the banking industry changes in interest rates are a significant risk that can impact earnings and the safety and soundness of an entity the company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by its asset liability management committee alco and approved by the board of directors the alco has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with the alco management policies including interest rate risk exposure one way the company measures and analyzes its interest rate risk is through net interest income simulation analysis simulation analysis incorporates substantially all of the companys assets and liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments together with forecasted changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment through this simulation management estimates the impact on net interest income of various interest rate changes that differ in the direction amount and speed of change over time as well as the shape of the yield curve this simulation includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to be affected by changes in loan and deposit growth assumptions are made to project interest rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis managements outlook and repricing strategies these assumptions are reviewed and validated on a periodic basis with sensitivity analysis being provided for key variables of the simulation the results are reviewed monthly by the alco and are used to guide assetliability management strategies the company manages its interest rate risk position by holding assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its balance sheet implementing certain pricing strategies for loans and deposits and selecting derivatives and various funding and investment portfolio strategies table summarizes the projected impact to net interest income over the next months of various potential interest rate changes the sensitivity of the projected impact to net interest income over the next months is dependent on balance sheet growth product mix deposit behavior pricing and funding decisions while the company utilizes models and assumptions based on historical information and expected behaviors actual outcomes could vary significantly december december down bps up bps down bps up bps gradual immediate

manage interest rate and other risks to manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate prepayment credit price and foreign currency fluctuations asset and liability management positions the company enters into derivative transactions the company uses derivatives for asset and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways to convert fixedrate debt and availableforsale investment securities from fixedrate payments to floatingrate payments to convert floatingrate debt from floatingrate payments to fixedrate payments to mitigate changes in value of the companys unfunded mortgage loan commitments funded mlhfs and msrs to mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances and to mitigate the volatility of the companys net investment in foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition the company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its customers customerrelated positions the company minimizes the market and liquidity risks of customer related positions by either entering into similar offsetting positions with brokerdealers or on a portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or nonderivative financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from these customerrelated positions the company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchangetraded centrally cleared through clearinghouses or overthecounter the company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes the company does not designate all of the derivatives that it enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges because of the inefficiency of applying the accounting requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the related hedged items in particular the company enters into interest rate swaps swaptions forward commitments to buy tobeannounced securities tbas us treasury and eurodollar futures and options on us treasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value of its msrs but does not designate those derivatives as accounting hedges the estimated net sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the fair value of the msrs and the related derivative instruments at december to an immediate and bps downward movement in interest rates would be a decrease of approximately million million and million respectively an immediate upward movement in interest rates at december of and bps would result in an increase of approximately million an increase of million and a decrease of million in the fair value of the msrs and related derivative instruments respectively refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding msrs additionally the company uses forward commitments to sell tbas and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at specified prices to economically hedge the interest rate risk in its residential mortgage loan production activities at december the company had billion of forward commitments to sell hedging billion of mlhfs and billion of unfunded mortgage loan commitments the forward commitments to sell and the unfunded mortgage loan commitments on loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives under the accounting guidance related to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities the company has elected the fair value option for the mlhfs derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the contracts credit risk associated with derivatives is measured by the company based on the probability of counterparty default including consideration of the covid19 pandemic the company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties by entering into master netting arrangements and where possible by requiring collateral arrangements the company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to third parties through the use of risk participation agreements in addition certain interest rate swaps interest rate forwards and credit contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk for additional information on derivatives and hedging activities refer to notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements libor transition in july the united kingdoms financial conduct authority the fca announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the london interbank offered rate libor after in march the fca and the administrator of libor announced that with respect to the most commonly used tenors of united

similarly impacted by the discontinuance of libor the company has transitioned financial instruments associated to libor currencies and tenors that ceased or became nonrepresentative on december to alternative reference rates with limited exceptions the company also anticipates that additional financial instruments associated to the remaining united states dollar libor tenors will require transition to a new reference rate by june this transition will occur over time as many of these arrangements do not have an alternative rate referenced in their contracts or a clear path for the parties to agree upon an alternative reference rate and therefore require remediation for residual exposure related to these rates after june the company is assessing the applicability of relevant contractual and statutory solutions certain states have passed legislation and federal legislation has been proposed that would transition contracts from libor to an alternative reference rate for any contracts with nonexistent or impracticable fallback language the company is assessing the impact of such legislative solutions to its various products in order to facilitate the transition process the company has instituted a libor transition office and commenced an enterprisewide project to identify assess monitor and mitigate risks associated with the expected discontinuance or unavailability of libor actively engage with industry working groups and regulators achieve operational readiness for the use of alternative reference rates and engage impacted customers to remediate and transition impacted instruments the company has also invested in updating its systems models procedures and internal infrastructure as part of the transition program additionally in alignment with guidance from united states banking agencies and the fca the company has ceased the use of libor as a reference rate in new contracts with limited exceptions and continues to increase the usage of alternative reference rates such as the secured overnight financing rate sofr the company has also adopted industry best practice guidelines for fallback language for new transactions converted its cleared

foreign currency denominated balances included on its consolidated balance sheet collectively covered positions employing methodologies consistent with the requirements of regulatory rules for market risk the companys market risk committee mrc within the framework of the alco oversees market risk management the mrc monitors and reviews the companys covered positions and establishes policies for market risk management including exposure limits for each portfolio the company uses a var approach to measure general market risk theoretically var represents the statistical risk of loss the company has to adverse market movements over a oneday time horizon the company uses the historical simulation method to calculate var for its covered positions measured at the ninety ninth percentile using a oneyear lookback period for distributions derived from past market data the market factors used in the calculations include those pertinent to market risks inherent in the underlying trading portfolios principally those that affect the companys corporate bond trading business foreign currency transaction business client derivatives business loan trading business and municipal securities business as well as those inherent in the companys foreign denominated balances and the derivatives used to mitigate the related measurement volatility on average the company expects the oneday var to be exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year related to these positions the company monitors the accuracy of internal var models and modeling processes by backtesting model performance regularly updating the historical data used by the var models and regular model validations to assess the accuracy of the models input processing and reporting components all models are required to be independently reviewed and approved prior to being placed in use if the company were to experience market losses in excess of the estimated var more often than expected the var models and associated assumptions would be analyzed and adjusted the average high low and periodend oneday var amounts for the companys covered positions were as follows year ended december  in millions average high low periodend the company did not experience any actual losses for its combined covered positions that exceeded var during the year ended december given the market volatility in the first quarter of resulting from effects of the covid19 pandemic the company experienced actual losses for its combined covered positions that exceeded var five times during the year ended december the company stress tests its market risk measurements to provide management with perspectives on market events that may not be captured by its var models including worst case historical market movement combinations that have not necessarily occurred on the same date the company calculates stressed var using the same underlying methodology and model as var except that a historical continuous oneyear lookback period is utilized that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the companys covered positions the period selected by the company includes the significant market volatility of the last four months of the average high low and periodend oneday stressed var amounts for the companys covered positions were as follows year ended december  in millions average high low periodend valuations of positions in client derivatives and foreign currency activities are based on discounted cash flow or other valuation techniques using marketbased assumptions these valuations are compared to thirdparty quotes or other market prices to determine if there are significant variances significant variances are approved by senior management in the companys corporate functions valuation of positions in the corporate bond trading loan trading and municipal securities businesses are based on trader marks these trader marks are evaluated against thirdparty prices with significant variances approved by senior management in the companys corporate functions the company also measures the market risk of its hedging activities related to residential mlhfs and msrs using the historical simulation method the vars are measured at the ninetyninth percentile and employ factors pertinent to the market risks inherent in the valuation of the assets and hedges a oneyear lookback period is used to obtain past market data for the models the average high and low var amounts for the residential mlhfs and related hedges and the msrs and related hedges were as follows year ended december  in
