andrew j cecere chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks george good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call ill begin on slide the second quarter was highlighted by our successful conversion of union bank and a meaningful increase in our common equity tier ratio to basis points higher than the first quarter driven by earnings accretion and balance sheet optimization actions earnings per share totaled in the second quarter including per share of notable items excluding the impact of notable items earnings per share was slide provides reported and adjusted income statement results and other key metrics our second quarter results were supported by new customer account growth and deepening the relationships across our business lines as well as continued disciplined expense management net interest income was lower compared with the first quarter primarily due to pressures on deposit pricing however momentum in fee income businesses continued strong one of the strengths of our business model is our diverse and stable funding that includes a mix of both consumer and operational wholesale deposits this quarter while our average deposit balances decreased by linked quarter periodend deposits were higher by or approximately billion largely reflective of seasonal operational deposit flows in areas such as our corporate banking and trust businesses credit quality metrics remained strong versus prepandemic levels but are normalizing as expected this quarter we strengthened our balance sheet by increasing the loan loss reserve reflective of our prudent approach to credit risk management us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 slide provides key performance metrics excluding notable items our return on average assets was and our return on tangible common equity was slide provides a summary of our recently completed conversion of union bank following our main systems conversion on memorial day weekend all credit card trust and investment accounts were transitioned to our platform in june early indications are encouraging and im even more confident today of the strategic and financial merits of this deal we continue to expect meaningful revenue opportunities and our cost synergy targets remain intact one highlight is the union bank customers are adopting our digital capabilities more quickly than expected as of june just one month following conversion weve had over million enrollments in our digital product offerings and this number continues to grow our teams are working diligently to leverage the value of overlaying all of our products and services to union bank customers and we will continue to provide updates on our progress ill now turn the call over to terry who will provide more detail on the quarter terrance r dolan chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp thanks andy turning to slide our balanced mix of consumer corporate and commercial deposits continues to be a key source of strength for the bank as andy highlighted while average total deposits declined or billion on a linked quarter basis we ended the period with billion of deposits representing a increase in ending balances on linked quarter this quarter our endofperiod percent of noninterestbearing deposits declined to approximately from in the first quarter due to both industry dynamics and a change we made to union bank retail accounts at conversion specifically about half of the decline was related to an increase in deposit volumes and mix shift while the other half was primarily driven by a customerfriendly product conversion decision by us to create a more positive customer experience we upgraded union bank customers to our interestbearing bank smartly checking product which offers a better checking solution as well as other benefits this change will provide customer retention benefits without a material impact on our net interest margin given current interest rate volatility and the significant competition for deposits across the industry we now expect our cumulative deposit beta to be in the mid range by the end of this rate cycle slightly higher than our previous expectation but consistent with the deposit pricing dynamics in the industry on slide average total loans this quarter were billion which was flat on a linked quarter basis and up yearoveryear commercial real estate loans represent approximately of our total average loan portfolio with commercial real estate office exposure representing only of total loans and of total commitments our office exposure is wellbalanced among suburban specialty and central business districts and had a weighted average loantovalue ratio of approximately at initial underwriting given current macro factors as well as other portfolio considerations we increased the reserve ratio for commercial real estate office loans to turning to slide we reported diluted earnings per share of for the quarter or per share after adjusting for notable items in the amount of million or per diluted common share notable items this quarter included million of merger and integration related charges associated with the acquisition of union us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 bank as well as million related to balance sheet optimization and capital management actions largely driven by a provision charge of million related to the securitization of approximately billion of indirect auto loans as well as an additional billion sale of union bank mortgage loans these moves enable us to more effectively position the balance sheet for profitable growth and optimized returns slide provides a more detailed earnings summary for the quarter turning to slide net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled approximately billion which represented a decrease on a linked quarter basis and a increase from a year ago due to the impact of rising rates and the acquisition of union bank our net interest margin declined from in the first quarter to in the second quarter which is somewhat lower than expected the linked quarter decline was primarily due to the impact of maintaining higher cash levels given the debt ceiling concerns and deposit pricing pressures partially offset by higher rates on earning assets slide highlights trends in noninterest income noninterest income increased or million on a linked quarter basis driven by higher payment services revenue trust and investment management fees and commercial product revenues within payment services revenue increased million on a linked quarter basis reflecting credit card revenue growth of million or driven by higher margins and sales volume and an increase in merchant processing revenue of million or driven by pricing also noteworthy were increases in trust and investment management fees of million or driven by core business growth and commercial product revenue of million or driven by strong debt capital markets activity in the quarter compared with a year ago noninterest income for the company increased million or largely driven by higher core fee income turning to slide reported noninterest expense for the company totaled billion in the second quarter which included million of merger and integrationrelated charges noninterest expense as adjusted decreased million or on a linked quarter basis slide shows credit quality trends which continue to be strong from a historical perspective but are normalizing as expected the ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was at june compared to at march and a year ago our second quarter net chargeoff ratio of as adjusted increased basis points from a first quarter level of as adjusted and was higher when compared to the second quarter level of our allowance for credit losses as of june totaled billion or of periodend loans turning to slide we accelerated our capital actions and ended the quarter with a cet1 capital ratio of the basis points linked quarter increase in the cet1 ratio reflected basis points of earnings accretion net of distributions and an additional basis points attributable to riskweighted asset and other balance sheet optimization initiatives with low to neutral earnings impact during the quarter we received the results of the federal reserves stress test and we expect to be subject to the minimum stress capital buffer requirement of which is unchanged from last year despite this years more stressful economic scenario and an additional billion of mergerrelated charges with limited recognition of cost synergies related to union bank i will provide third quarter and updated full year forwardlooking guidance on slide starting with third quarter guidance we expect net interest income of between billion and billion in the third quarter us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 total revenue as adjusted is estimated to be in the range of billion to billion including approximately million of purchase accounting accretion total noninterest expense as adjusted is expected to be approximately billion inclusive of approximately million of core deposit intangible amortization related to the union bank acquisition our income tax rate as adjusted is expected to be approximately to on a taxable equivalent basis we expect merger and integration charges of between million to million in the third quarter i will now provide updated guidance for the full year for net interest income is expected to be in the range of billion to billion total revenue as adjusted is now expected to be in the range of billion to billion inclusive of approximately million of full year purchase accounting accretion total noninterest expense as adjusted for the year is expected to be approximately billion inclusive of approximately million of core deposit intangible amortization related to union bank our estimated full year income tax rate on a taxable equivalent basis as adjusted is expected to be approximately to we continue to expect to have million to billion of merger and integration charges in and total merger and integration costs of approximately billion consistent with earlier guidance i will now hand it back to andy for closing remarks andrew j cecere chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks terry ill finish up on slide the strength and stability of our balance sheet remains a differentiator for our company and as these metrics indicate we are wellcapitalized and prepared for a potentially more challenging economic environment given our strong liquidity diversified business mix and consistent and disciplined approach to credit risk management building capital remains a top priority as we prepare for category ii designation and we are confident in our ability to execute on our strategic growth opportunities and key initiatives following the successful conversion of union bank this quarter we enter the second half of the year well positioned as a national banking franchise with increased scale broader reach and meaningful revenue growth opportunities provided by the addition of million new consumer and small business customers across the business from consumer to wealth management and commercial to business banking we see significant opportunities to provide legacy union bank customers with a broad set of our products and services and industryleading digital capabilities additionally the million of identified cost synergies are still expected to be fully reflected in run rate savings as we head into let me close by thanking our employees for all that they do to help provide exceptional service that makes us a destination of choice for our clients and a valued partner to all our stakeholders well now open up the call to qa us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions well first go to scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning scott scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey i was hoping maybe we could start off with a couple thoughts or expanded thoughts on capital maybe just sort of a refresher on anticipated capital build from here especially in light of just how quickly you just how quick the pace was in the second quarter and then ideally sort of what youre targeting presumably under category ii rules and when you might get there in your view terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah thanks scott i think that we end up at cet1 at the end of second quarter our expectation now through the rest of this year is that well be at least at by the end of the year and thats going to be a function of earnings accretion net of distributions as well as some continued actions from a riskweighted asset perspective we had originally articulated about basis points of riskweighted asset optimization over kind of the twoyear time horizon we felt like we could accelerate that a lot because the vast majority of them were what i would call low to neutral impact on earnings accretion we still have a number of different levers that we can pull some of which well be able to execute on this year some of which is in preparation for but we feel very confident that we have a game plan in order to be able to get to at least by the end of this year and to be in a position to be able to fully adopt category ii by the end of if necessary scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect thank you and then maybe a question on the deposits appreciate all the commentary on the noninterest bearing runoff being i guess about half driven by the product change as you integrated union bank customers but just given the sort of the optics of it just curious about any thoughts is that pretty much done or would you expect for the broader or entirety of the firm could nib balances still continue to flow out just in light of where interest rates are and where would you see those fleshing out maybe as a percent of total deposits john c stern a presidentglobal corporate trust and custody senior executive vice president headfinance incoming chief financial officer us bancorp hey scott this is john so in terms of the dda mix you illustrated that correctly we moved about billion of deposits over into the bank smartly interest checking product and so that gets us to about a ratio we think that thats about where we land here it will be plus or minus of course as we kind of go through the quarters but we think were at a low point here us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good thank you very much andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks scott operator and next we can go to john pancari with evercore please go ahead andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning regarding your net interest income guidance of the billion billion beyond the noninterestbearing mix commentary that you just provided can you also help unpack that guidance in terms of overall deposit growth expectations as well as maybe the margin assumption behind that and the loan growth as well if possible thanks john c stern a presidentglobal corporate trust and custody senior executive vice president headfinance incoming chief financial officer us bancorp sure this is john again so couple things i would say maybe just to provide additional context as you saw in our results we saw a big increase in our deposits up on a periodending basis to billion and then we had with as terry mentioned about our capital actions we had loans drop as a start point of about given the auto and the mortgage sale that we talked about within our comments and so as i think about those things we will have the ability to be a little bit more disciplined and moderate in our deposit pricing as we go forward given that line of thinking and in addition i think that as we bring on new loans those loans are coming at wider spreads although loan growth is a little bit stalled as theres a little bit less demand for that in the near term here and the mix here of loans should be more favorable as were bringing on cards and less in mortgage and auto so those are kind of the puts and takes to how we came up with the net interest income guidance and then i think you made a comment about deposits there as well and i can just touch on that i think on deposit side we would even though we had a large seasonal uplift as is typical in the second quarter from our corporate trust and commercial businesses that bring in deposit balances as that begins to normalize we think were probably in line with the industry which we anticipate being more of a decline given the quantitative tightening and all the other sorts of things that are headwinds for deposits in the industry terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah and the other thing i would just mention john you asked a question regarding nim our expectation now just kind of looking at the market implied rate environment is that nim is probably down a few basis points in the third quarter and then relatively stable through the rest of the year us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it no thank you thats very helpful and just lastly the confidence in your throughthecycle deposit beta of about looks like we have a number of banks that are turning to the high and into the just what gives you the confidence in that throughthecycle beta expectation of around john c stern a presidentglobal corporate trust and custody senior executive vice president headfinance incoming chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so were looking at our calculations shows at about in the current beta and were indicating mid is where well land and i think it just goes back to some of the things that we talked about earlier where we did have a big flight in of deposits well we have loans that have come down given the capital actions and so that gives us a little bit more flexibility with pricing but of course there will be pressure as it relates to deposit betas just as we go throughout but all of that is kind of baked into our mid guide john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks john operator and next we can go to ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning ebrahim how are you ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good how are you good morning just wanted to follow up on this capital build its obviously a big topic as we think about future rwa optimization remind i think you mentioned some of the lowhanging fruit i guess things that were eps neutral it seems like you executed on those this quarter as we look forward to i think you mentioned some action in the back half come into how punitive are those going to be from an eps standpoint that we should think about im assuming thats in your guidance for but give us a sense of just the eps hit from these actions and how much more of rwa optimization should we think about between now and lets say yearend terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah great question ebrahim and so let me maybe unpack it a little bit in terms of the different types of actions that we are likely to take one as an example is were going to be kind of winding down a cash provisioning of business so that will have very minimal impact from an earnings perspective because its not that big of a business but it is a pretty significant user of capital in terms of riskweighted asset so thats one area one us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 example of how we still think that theres low to neutral sort of opportunity in terms of enhancing or improving the riskweighted asset position well continue to be focused on reducing our msr our mortgage servicing rights portfolio over the course of the next several quarters thats an area that again it has some impact but its not significant and probably more importantly it allows us to rebalance the size of the mortgage exposure mortgage portfolio relative to the overall size of the business well continue to look at kind of similarly mortgage loan sales out of the union bank portfolio again that reduces our concentration in california and should have minimal sort of impact kind of on a goforward basis then theres just a number of other things similar sort of structures that weve done but the other thing that were working on between now and the end of the year which will kind of position us well to be able to continue to improve on a riskweighted asset basis is setting up some securitization programs related to some of our other balance sheet asset positions ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and just one followup strategically i think the one question is in this environment should be ideal for usb to take market share competitors are under pressure clearly your balance sheet holding up quite well give us a sense of just how much of a constrained capital levels are today as you think about getting new customer growth picking up market share adding sort of maximizing the union franchise just how much of a restrictive factor capital is to accomplish all of those terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp go ahead andy andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so ebrahim i wouldnt say its a constraint were focused on profitable growth we have a diverse set of business products and services that allow us to grow in a capital efficient way i mean id give you a couple examples the union bank customer base about of the consumer small businesses are single service customers their penetration on credit cards is about half what ours is across the legacy us bank so we have a lot of opportunities to deepen relationships in a very capitalefficient way given the broad product set that we have so that is an opportunity that we are very much focused on looking forward to and not feeling constrained terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp and many of those single service our balance sheet today deepening the relationship will be as much focused on feebased sort of businesses which are capitalefficient as andy said ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions operator and next well move to ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey ken terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hi ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning guys hey really good fee result this quarter i just wanted to ask you as im looking at the payment slide on page it does look like the yearoveryear growth rates did all slow versus the first quarter could you just talk about whats going on across the payments with regards to just where the consumer is and how you expect corporate spending to trend as you look ahead given the potential for a slowing economy terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah and of course thats the question is whether or not we actually move into a recession or not but i think broadly from a macro perspective and some of the things that were seeing is that some of the excess savings that consumers have held in the past has come down to really prepandemic levels at this particular point in time so i think that manifests itself in kind of a normalization of consumer spend so we are seeing what was very strong consumer spend starting to normalize and soften if you will i mean yesterday was retail sales information that came out a little bit softer than maybe expected were seeing some of those same dynamics in the payments business where sales for example in the merchant side of the equation slower softer sort of retail sales but theres still a fair amount of travel expenditure thats taking place so customers are certainly choosing and maybe being a little bit more choosy as to where theyre spending their dollars some of the dynamics that were seeing is while sales have softened maybe a bit the margins in some of the businesses have actually improved so on the credit card side of the equation where sales have come down a little bit the margins are actually a little stronger on the corporate payment side of the equation margins continued to get stronger because te spend in the commercial corporate sectors has continued to be reasonably strong so we continue to kind of look out the rest of the year on the merchant acquiring side of the equation of revenue kind of in that high singledigits sort of range on the credit card fee revenue still in that midsingledigits and on the corporate payments side of the equation it will normalize but it will kind of normalize in that high singledigits range thats kind of what were seeing and what were kind of forecasting at this particular point in time based upon consumer behavior ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it and one followup on capital can you just give us just so we all have the right number from your perspective where cet1 was this quarter inclusive of afs unrealized losses and also just your view of if rates stay the same here what that pull to par looks like as you look forward to that yearend point thanks us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so if you were to embed the aoci into the cet1 calculation under category ii it would have been at and we expect that based upon all of our capital actions to get to kind of our target levels by the end of we have the game plan in order to be able to get there we feel confident about that ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay do you just have the afs piece of what does pull to par by the end of the year because its hard for us to understand how much the riskweighted asset part might be but at least we can kind of track to your view of the portfolio maturity terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah do you have that john john c stern a presidentglobal corporate trust and custody senior executive vice president headfinance incoming chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so in terms of the burndown between here and the end of its about or so terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thank you operator next we can go to erika najarian with ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning i need to ask the capital question again just because its such a big deal for your stock and im wondering if you could indulge me in some sort of cavewoman math here so cet1 you have six quarters to generate capital based on what youre earning today you could add another basis points right for six quarters times and that will get you to so given that youve mentioned both terry and john throughout the call some additional rwa actions how much can rwa actions enhance that potential for fully loaded cet1 by just on earnings how much can you add from rwa mitigation terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so maybe just kind of unpacking a little bit we still expect erika that the benefit from capital accretion or earnings accretion is going to be somewhere in that to basis points on average and a couple of different things to kind of keep in mind while theres a little more pressure on the revenue side of the equation the things that will start to come into the equation is a lot lower merger and integration charges next year us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 well be substantially done with that as well as the fact that by the end of the year we will really be at kind of full run rate from a cost synergy standpoint so i think that theres a number of things just in terms of why we feel confident that that accretion level starts to accelerate or creep up from where were at today and then i think when you end up going through john talked a little bit about the burndown being at about between now and the end of the year and thats based upon market implied but also keep in mind as we have said is we have put into place some hedging strategies to protect us from the upside risk that might exist if rates were to move up so we feel pretty good about where that is going to come in and then the rest of it is really tied to riskweighted asset actions many of which i end up talking about and again we have a pretty confident game plan with respect to our ability to reduce riskweighted assets in order to be able to achieve the targets that we need to hit erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc let me just asking it another way again just because it feels like some of the good stuff thats going on in the company is being ignored because of this capital question regarding category ii based on your outlook and under a reasonable range of scenarios for the economy do you think you could get to to fully loaded cet1 by terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah absolutely erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you operator and next we can go to john mcdonald with atomic research sic autonomous research please go ahead terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hi john john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp thanks terry just one last followup on that walk starting from the getting to to so is that the idea that the aoci is kind of like a basis point drag today and that will shrink to in your numbers something like basis points or that kind of drag by the end of next year terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yes us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp okay and does your walk include like fdic assessment and cecl phasein things like that terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yes john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp okay the next question was just on credit how do you see chargeoff trajectory from here i know youve said normalized basis points you wont get there for a while but the jumping off point is basis points i guess this quarter how do you see it kind of playing out from here terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah its going to continue to normalize for all the different things we have been talking about and i think the industry has been talking about our expectation is that that creeps up into the kind of mid by maybe the end of the year early next year and then it kind of normalizes around basis points once we get into john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp okay got it and does the full year guidance on expenses for this year incorporate some achievement of merger saves in the fourth quarter this year terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp in terms of cost synergies or john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp yeah yes terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah absolutely absolutely andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp it gets us to the run rate john of the full million by the end of the quarter terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so when we get into we will have achieved a full run rate of million of cost synergies us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp and you will have achieved most of those by the fourth quarter of this year terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp by the end of the fourth quarter yeah john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp okay and thats built into the guidance for the full year this year terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yes john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp okay thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks john operator and we can go to chris kotowski with oppenheimer please go ahead chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc yeah i think last quarter you shared that the average duration of your securities portfolio went down from like years to years or something like that and i wonder if you could give us the similar trend in the second quarter and the outlook for the balance of the year and just your philosophy in general about reinvesting maturities is that kind of going into cash or are you kind of maintaining the duration that you have terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah the duration that we have talked about with respect to the afs portfolio was years and that has continued to come down a little bit not measurably but down a little bit from there our game plan i guess is that were going to continue to work on shortening the duration of the afs portfolio it kind of helps us derisk that well keep more in short term sort of securities whether its debt or cash but it will be kind of a combination us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc and on the htm portfolio is there a similar kind of move to shorten duration or are you comfortable where it is terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah well with respect to the htm portfolio thats just kind of going to run down over time or burn down over time were not adding to the htm portfolio at this particular point chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc okay all righty great thank you operator and well move to vivek juneja with jpmorgan please go ahead andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc sorry if its repetitive given the multiple calls so i guess couple of things on merchant processing any color on why its up only yearonyear in terms of fees i hear you on the travel slowing but thats also lower fee but whats caused such a sharp slowdown and what turns that around to the midsingledigits terry terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah some of its yearoveryear comp and how it will kind of play out but the biggest driver vivek in the merchant processing at this particular point is the fact that the travel airlines specifically is continuing to become a higher portion of the overall mix that we think is starting to stabilize in other words much of that growth has been in the airline space but we think that that kind of stabilizes airline happens to have a lower margin and so thats the dynamic that youre seeing vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay and oci your loss seems to have gone up did you not get any benefit from the hedges youve put on or is there something else going on underneath terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah go ahead john john c stern a presidentglobal corporate trust and custody senior executive vice president headfinance incoming chief financial officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 the investment portfolio aoci declined or the mark declined by about million linked quarter but rates went up to basis points upon the points of the curve that matter to the portfolio so its not a totally as we talked about theres a duration to that book and so you would expect a wider mark given the higher level of rates so i think with the hedges that we have put in place that helped mute that it could have been higher and we continue to add hedges across that portfolio and pick our spots when we see rates fall vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you operator and well go to gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning gentlemen terry youve talked a bit about a normalization in net chargeoffs moving into can you share with us what kind of assumptions youre using to get to that normalization rate in chargeoffs both economic and just the way the customer base may behave terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp do you want to talk about that andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah from an economic standpoint gerard ill start this is andy we think theres probably fairly equal weight probability that well either see a soft landing or a mild recession and if we do get a recession our models would indicate it would be short and shallow either late this year or early in and you know theres still pricing pressure and the inflation is not solved so we have one more rate hike by the end of the year modeled in but on the other hand as terry mentioned excess savings has come down significantly and consumer spending is slowing so the fed is getting its desired outcome so big picture we think the fed is close to being done and as i said sort of this probability of either shallow and soft or mild recession andor a soft landing is what weve modeled in to get to those assumptions as terry articulated terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp couple things i would just add maybe from a portfolio dynamic perspective were seeing nice growth in terms of credit card balances and as credit card balances both increase and it normalizes youll start to see that ratio going up because thats a little higher mix for us and then i think maybe somewhat lumpy but its kind of incorporated into it is just continuing to work through commercial real estate office space over the course of the next few years us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then i apologize if you addressed this question but with the expectation of the basel iii endgame capital requirements coming shortly and this week the disclosure is that it seems like residential mortgages may be exposed to higher riskweighted assets how are you guys thinking about that in terms of rwa strategies if mortgages do get a bigger weight and other areas are greater than expected terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah well certainly a lot of our actions for example with respect to mortgages and in that particular business is just continuing to derisk so to speak so were kind of trying to take that into consideration our expectation right now gerard is that its probably going to be fairly neutral to maybe just a little bit of a benefit based upon everything that were seeing in terms of the endgame but we really have to wait and see what the final rules say and then apply it to our specific portfolio gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you terry thank you andy andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks gerard operator and next we go to betsy graseck with morgan stanley andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning just a couple of quick followups one the asset sale that you did this quarter was that at the beginning of the quarter or the end im just trying to understand how much like revenue from that portfolio you have in terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah most of them were completed at the end of the closer to the end of the second quarter so in the june timeframe betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then the revenue outlook for the full year is that based on june balance sheet or is that also including the rwa actions youre planning on taking between now and yearend us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp both it incorporates our capital actions in terms of what we expect to execute on between now and the end of the year betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay got it all right okay thank you thats it andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks betsy operator and next we can move to mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning mike andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi well on the capital issue i asked last quarter do you think theres any chance that you need to raise capital or cut the dividend ill just ask it again i mean people are doing these mechanistic analyses where they would take the unrealized securities losses reduce that from tangible equity ph to give you credit and then say you would need to raise capital so now that youve met your yearend capital target i guess would you reiterate or to what degree would you reiterate no capital increase no dividend cut and in addition if you could put it in a broader context the vice chair of the fed barr last week said that actually the economic value of equity of banks goes up because of higher value of deposits so it seems like he signs on to a lot of the analyses that we analysts do so just if you could comment on the bigger picture about your capital and the flexibility there andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah mike this is andy and as terry mentioned so we accelerated rwa actions got to at the end of the second quarter well ahead of our by the end of the year we expect to be at least by the end of the year if not better and we have a game plan were comfortable with and confident enough to get to under the basel under the cat ii definition by the end of so all those things make us confident in the capital walk that we talked about and the actions were taking us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then on the negative side you and a lot of regional banks have continued to lower guidance on nii and here we go again with that and look i mean rates went up faster than you or anyone had expected the yield curve is a lot more inverted i guess competition has picked up more than expected what inning do you think youre in in terms of this downward revision for nii do you think youre kind of there now you said third quarter could be down a little bit and as you exit the year do you think you maintain that third quarter level i think you said nim would be flat after that but im not sure if you mentioned nii so is the downward revision for nii done or eighth inning seventh inning and what does that mean for kind of run rate going into next year terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so again obviously you heard the guidance with respect to nii and nim we expect it to be a few basis points down in the third quarter and then relatively stable from there obviously this is rate its fed policy kind of dependent so were trying to look at what the current environment looks like but we feel like if i had to kind of put what inning are we in i think were in the late innings simply because of where the fed is from a monetary policy standpoint so while there may continue to be a little bit of downward pressure we dont see it as being significant from here andy what would you add andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp mike the other thing i would add is i think one of the benefits of our business model is the diversity of revenue so even in a stressed environment on deposits which youre actually right about we have the payments revenue the trust revenue the commercial products revenue and on top of all that million of cost synergies that were going to act on so were pulling lots of levers not just on margin mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp you bet operator and next we have a followup from john mcdonald with autonomous research please go ahead john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp hi terry thanks one more on the mitigation and optimization opportunity originally you had talked about basis points to harness this year obviously you got basis points this quarter and now it sounds like the total is more im just trying to is there a way to size how much more you might see out there between the remainder of this year and next year relative to the original basis points you were targeting us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah again the basis points that we were targeting we knew we had a high level of confidence in terms of being able to achieve it because there were low to kind of neutral impact and there were things that we could kind of execute on we definitely believe that as we get into the standing up which obviously takes a little bit longer standing up of securitization programs and many of the actions that i talked about earlier gets us to where we need to be from a capital perspective when you take into consideration the burndown et cetera so that opportunity i think is probably in line with another basis points would be my guess john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp okay and when you say no impact or low impact we did see some this quarter like in terms of the chargeoffs and taxes i guess theyre not run rate is that what you mean that you could have episodic one quarter type impacts terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah absolutely well continue to see that as we reposition the balance sheet but again those impacts are all taken into consideration when we think about the net rwa impacts john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp okay and again your target that you want to get to for the fully loaded by the end of next year is what terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah well it will be fully adopted it would be roughly john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp okay thank you operator and we have no further questions at this time ill now turn it back to george andersen please continue george andersen directorinvestor relations us bancorp thank
