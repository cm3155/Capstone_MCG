sheet growth this quarter including deposit growth of over billion or compared with the third quarter average loans grew by linked quarter or excluding the impact of loan forgiveness related to ppp we are encouraged by the loan growth momentum and we have a positive outlook for given improving client sentiment and business conditions and continued strength in certain focus commercial portfolios such as abs lending and supply chain financing the significant increase in liquidity provided by the strong deposit inflows this quarter puts us in a favorable position to support future balance sheet growth deposit growth provided the opportunity for tactical investment in cash management strategies that pressured the net interest margin for the fourth quarter but was both accretive to net interest income and maintained asset sensitivity for our rising rate environment us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 turning to fees underlying client acquisition and market share trends across our business lines were healthy and payment sales trends continue to improve on a yearoveryear basis this quarter we released million of loan loss reserves reflecting continued strong credit quality including a record low net chargeoff ratio in the lower right quadrant you can see that our book value per share totaled at december which was higher than september our cet1 capital ratio was at december slide provides key performance metrics slide highlights trends in digital engagement digital transactions now account for over of total transactions and digital loan sales account for twothirds of total loan sales turning to slide we continue to believe our initiatives aimed at connecting our banking customers with our payment products and our services and our payments customers with our banking products and services will allow us to grow our small business relationships by to and related revenue by to over the next few years now let me turn the call over to terry who will provide more detail on the quarter terrance r dolan chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp thanks andy if you turn to slide ill start with the balance sheet review followed by a discussion of fourth quarter earnings trends average loans increased compared with the third quarter driven by a increase in commercial loans which benefited from new business activity and improved utilization rates retail loan growth was driven primarily by higher credit card balances growth in residential mortgages and strong production of installment loans including auto lending at december ppp loan balances totaled billion compared to billion at september excluding ppp loans fourth quarter average loans grew by on a linked quarter basis turning to slide total average deposits increased by billion or compared with the third quarter we continued to see favorable mix shift with average noninterestbearing deposits increasing by and average savings deposits increasing by while higher cost time deposits decreased by slide shows credit quality trends the ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was at december compared with at september and a year ago our fourth quarter net chargeoff ratio of improved on both a linked quarter and yearoveryear basis borrower liquidity and stronger asset valuations continued to support repayment and recovery of problem loans our reserve release was million this quarter primarily reflecting strong credit quality metrics our allowance for credit losses as of september sic december totaled billion or of loans slide provides an earnings summary in the fourth quarter of we earned per diluted share these results included a reserve release of million turning to slide net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of billion came in a little higher than our expectations the million decrease compared with the third quarter was driven by a million decline in ppp interest and fees partially offset by earning asset growth us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 our net interest margin declined by basis points on a linked quarter basis to the net interest margin decline was related to a basis point impact from lower ppp loan interest and fees and a basis point impact from elevated liquidity and related investment portfolio and cash management strategies aimed at optimizing our asset sensitivity going into slide highlights trends in noninterest income compared with the year ago noninterest income declined by as compared as strong growth in payments revenue trust and investment management fees deposit service charges and commercial product revenue was more than offset by a decrease in mortgage revenue reflecting the interest rate environment and lower securities gains and other fee revenue on a linked quarter basis noninterest income declined by primarily reflecting the seasonally lower payments and capital markets revenues and declining mortgage banking revenue as expected slide provides information on our payment services businesses sales volumes in each of our three businesses exceeded prepandemic levels in the fourth quarter despite some omicronrelated softness in late december we expect yearoveryear payments momentum to continue into as lagging sectors such as airline hospitality and corporate te benefit from a continued cyclical recovery toward prepandemic levels and as our multiyear investments in ecommerce and techled drive secular growth improvements as we saw in our earnings press release this morning effective january us bank has eliminated fees for certain nonsufficient funds we believe this is not only the right thing to do for customers but it is a smart business decision for some time we have been at the forefront of using digital technology to help our customers avoid overdraft charges and our efforts have helped our customers more easily and effectively manage their money which has contributed to increased customer satisfaction this latest move is simply the next step in the process turning to slide noninterest expense increased by million or compared with the third quarter this increase was driven by higher medical claims within employee benefit expense and higher professional services expenses higher marketing and business development costs tax credit amortization expense was also higher in the fourth quarter in line with typical seasonal trends slide highlights our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio at december was which decreased slightly compared with september driven by riskweighted asset growth and the impact of acquisitions completed near the end of the quarter as a reminder at the beginning of the third quarter we suspended our share buyback program due to our recent announcement that we have agreed to acquire union bank we continue to expect that our share repurchase program will be deferred until the second half of after the closing of the acquisition we expect to operate at a cet1 capital ratio between our target ratio and i will now provide some forwardlooking guidance we expect both net interest income on a taxableequivalent basis as well as our net interest margin to be relatively stable on a linked quarter basis with growth expected in subsequent quarters under our base case us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 scenario which incorporates three rate hikes we expect full year net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis to increase at a midsingledigit pace we expect mortgage revenue to be slightly lower in the first quarter on a linked quarter basis in line with slower refinancing activity in the market payments revenue is seasonally lower in the first quarter on a yearoveryear basis we expect total revenue to increase at a highsingledigit pace driven by doubledigit growth in both merchant processing revenue and corporate payments revenue we expect credit card revenue to be stable on a yearoveryear basis as high singledigit growth in credit and debit card fees is offset by lower prepaid processing fees excluding the prepaid headwind which will abate after the first quarter we expect total payment revenue to increase at a low teen rate on a yearoveryear basis in the first quarter we expect other revenue to approximate million to million per quarter over the course of we expect expenses to be relatively stable in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter credit quality remains strong over the next few quarters we expect the net chargeoff ratio to remain lower than historical levels but will normalize over time as the effects of the pandemic continue to subside for the full year we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately i will hand it back to andy for closing comments andrew j cecere chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks terry fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations and we are starting off the year with momentum building across our lending and fee businesses we feel good about the trajectory of loan growth and are well positioned to benefit from a rising rate environment we expect client acquisition growth and account penetration to drive market share gains across our fee businesses in particular we believe will be another good year for our payments business due to the omicron surge yearoveryear sales growth have slowed somewhat in the past few weeks from the exceptionally strong pace we saw in the second half of however growth rates remain strong and we believe this will likely prove to be a speed bump rather than an extended slowdown nonetheless the situation is fluid and well continue to monitor trends closely and update you along the way our investments in technology to support our digital transformation and payments ecosystem initiatives are paying off and we continue to look for uses of capital that would drive higher returns in the fourth quarter we acquired travelbank a fintech that provides techdriven expense and travel management solutions to help businesses manage their operations more efficiently also in the fourth quarter we closed on the acquisition of pfm asset management which not only increased our assets under management but has enhanced our position in a niche area within the money market world we are looking forward to closing our previously announced acquisition of union bank later this year the addition of union bank will increase our scale improve our market share in a demographically attractive market and add over million consumer clients and over business banking customers to whom we can offer us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 our leading digital capabilities and our expansive product set the strategic and financial benefits of this combination will accrue to shareholders over many years but the numbers only tell part of the us banks story as we start a new year i want to emphasize that how we do things will continue to be as important as what we do and so in closing id like to thank our employees who come in every day with the goal of doing the right thing for our customers our communities their fellow employees and our constituents thank you for helping to make a successful year and position us well for the future we will now open up the call to qa question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question is from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co morning everybody thank you for taking my question andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey lets see maybe terry i was hoping you could please discuss in just a bit more detail your updated thoughts on rate sensitivity given some of the changes in the balance sheet in the fourth quarter terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so we had the opportunity because of the deposit flows to be able to both invest in investment securities to help a little bit in terms of the fourth quarter but we also at the same time utilized hedging strategies to keep the duration of those purchases relatively short and the expectation scott is that when longterm rates rise which were starting to see now that were going to be able to unwind those swaps and be able to take advantage of the rising rate environment so we did all of that fundamentally to be able to maintain as much asset sensitivity going into as we possibly could r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good thank you and then perhaps either for andy or terry maybe just a thought or comment regarding the anticipated kind of composition of loan growth through it certainly sounds like a constructive outlook but maybe just kind of commercial versus consumer as you see it us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so maybe ill just kind of start with fourth quarter one of the things we saw in the fourth quarter not only strong consumer continuing but the ci portfolio actually starting to expand very nicely and we talked a little bit about that so as we look into we continue to expect that consumer credit is going to continue to strengthen auto lending may be a little bit more moderate than it was in but i think credit card continues to be very strong as payment rates come down and then we also would expect that residential mortgage portfolio loans would be growing but i think the real story is that were now starting to see a nice shift with respect to the commercial and the ci portfolios were continuing to see growth in certain segments like assetbacked securitization lending some of those sorts of things that we saw earlier in the year but in the fourth quarter in the end of the fourth quarter we saw nice expansion of utilization rates i think it was like basis points on average third versus fourth quarter but in december it was up almost and we would expect to kind of see that i think the other thing i would say is that sentiment on the commercial side people are rebuilding their inventories i think from a supply chain perspective they still have some concerns about that and so i think that theyre being cautious about making sure that they have inventory to be able to run their business and i think theyre starting to make business investment ahead of the consumer spend that they see and the economic growth that they see in so andy what would you add andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp terry i think you hit the high points and two changes in trends in the fourth quarter that look positive going into scott number one as terry mentioned the increase in utilization rates which we havent seen for a number of quarters and secondly is the start of the decline in payment rates which helps credit card volumes so those are two positives id call out as well r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right thank you very much operator your next question is from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 good morning terry good morning andy andy coming back to the big transaction that obviously you guys are doing you touched on all the benefits that union bank will bring to the table to us bancorp can you share with us what the update is on the regulatory approval process theres a lot of obviously uncertainty in washington today at the fed and other regulatory agencies with new heads coming in over time maybe an update could this be delayed what is the risk of it just being delayed getting the approval andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah thanks gerard so we submitted our application in early october weve been working with union bank and we have a number of acquisition teams both on our side as well as the union bank side working on integration activities including technology as well as the business lines and weve been responding and working with the regulators in terms of questions on the submission which is normal course for this process so we continue to believe that this will close in the first half it may be later in the first half but thats our continued belief with a conversion in the late third quarter or septemberoctober timeframe so nothing to have us believe that it would be any different from that and were preparing for that timeframe gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc obviously theres a lot of discussion on your call and other calls about asset sensitivity and what the outlook is for this year but pivoting for a moment im kind of looking at what were all going to be talking about on the fourth quarter call for in january of and i got a sense it might be more about credit than it is today and you guys have stood out as being some of the best underwriters in the industry can you share with us what are you seeing out there in terms of underwriting from your competitors are people getting more aggressive to generate revenue loan growth or no everybodys still pretty conservative terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah gerard i think what i would the way i would kind of describe it from our perspective we havent changed our credit box really at all we really tried to underwrite through the cycle i think that there has been a lot of competition in the industry for loan growth over the last months and as you know when the cycle turns its the decisions you made today that are going to end up impacting you two or three years down the road so i do think that credit normalizes as we go through the year i dont know if we quite get back to where we were prepandemic but i think that it will start to migrate in that direction us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 i would say that if there is loosening from an underwriting perspective maybe stretching a little bit more with respect to structure but it has been competitive both from an underwriting perspective as well as from a pricing perspective out there gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and just to follow up on that quickly terry how about exceptions are you seeing more exceptions to the credit underwriting box to get deals done terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp again from our perspective we really havent changed our approach at all again i think from a competitive standpoint again theyre focused on being as competitive as they possibly can in terms of the underwriting and their structures and their pricing but from our perspective we havent really changed our approach gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc as always thank you appreciate the color andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks gerard operator your next question is from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning john john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning guys andy maybe from a highlevel perspective you might not want to give specific guidance but just kind of your thoughts about the revenue and expense dynamics that youre looking at heading into maybe some thoughts on the revenue headwinds and tailwinds that youre looking at and how you plan on managing inflation on the expense base and just kind of overall how does operating leverage feel as a goal for this year andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure john and terry gave a little guidance on net interest income for the year but i will talk about the full balance sheet and income statement we continue to expect midsingledigit earning asset growth for the year that loan momentum that we talked about looks positive going into we would expect revenue growth of to john on a full year basis as well as positive operating leverage of at least basis points for us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it and then maybe just a question on the nii guide terry you mentioned three hikes just whats the cadence of what youve built in on that and is there any rule of thumb for what one fed hike of basis points does to the nim or nii everything else equal that might be helpful for us thanks terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so our base case as we said bakes in three rate hikes really starting in the second quarter and then kind of as you might expect through the rest of the year if you go back to just our disclosures at the end of third quarter it really hasnt changed a lot a basis point shock is about from a net interest income standpoint so i would kind of refer you back to that if you think about three rate hikes kind of on that pace youre probably talking about the equivalency of about a basis point shock so if youre kind of doing the math you can kind of go to that andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp and terry all those numbers are the impacts of net interest income in addition we have our waivers which total about million a quarter john and you get about twothirds of that back at the first rate hike of basis points and about of it back at the second rate hike john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay got it thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure operator your next question is from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey betsy terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning betsy us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey couple of questions just on the guide a couple of cleanups the nii midsingledigit pace is that a qon q from or thats a full year versus full year excluding union bank terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp everything is excluding union bank and its intended to be the guidance that were giving for betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right so thats versus full year terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp full year versus full year yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right right right okay all right just wanted to make sure and then when im thinking about the positive operating leverage of at least basis points thats obviously a nice uptick from what youve been doing recently can you over the past couple years i guess can you kind of highlight is this a function of the rate environment being better primarily or is it also from some of the investment spend that youve been making that you are leveraging and basically able to switch on the optimization side of the investment spend terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah betsy i would say its kind of a combination of both i mean the improving revenue environment certainly helps that but we have been as you say making some significant investment in digital capabilities and as that investment matures we kind of fully expect that we would see some operating efficiencies on the expense side we have been working through tech modernization which that helps us and were always looking for kind of from a continuous improvement point of view trying to optimize the branch network as well as our operations so i think its a combination of both betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and on the investment spend side therell be some in integrating union bank of course but beyond that where would you be targeting investment dollars from here terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i think that when we think about our technology investment continuing to have investment in our mortgage business and our digital mobile app capabilities but a strong focus on realtime payments money movement and us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 on the whole b2b side of the equation is going to be important and then of course weve been talking about the ecosystem between our payments business and our business banking and so well continue to make investment there so i think its kind of a continuation of many of the same themes that weve had over the last year on a core basis we really dont expect any significant increase in the investment levels but we continue to expect that we will maintain those investment levels going forward betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay thanks for the color on that andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks betsy operator your next question is from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi good morning guys terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc a couple nii cleanups please so you mentioned that ppp was an million decline which i think was bigger than what you had anticipated previously at million to million im just wondering what kind of ppp decline do you still have in that first quarter outlook for nii flat sequentially terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so i mean the decline from third to fourth quarter was the most significant it was a little bit higher than what we had expected part of that is because some of what we had expected to occur in actually kind of got pulled forward into the fourth quarter currently in our baseline or our expectation is that there will be a very immaterial decline in ppp going from fourth to first its about million million so its pretty insignificant ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and is that the last kind of meaningful stepdown from there does it pretty much wind out from there just trying to get to like that baseline where we can move past the ppp us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp really we look at as being past ppp in all respect so yes i would agree that first quarter is probably the last stepdown that we have and again its not really significant and its incorporated into our guidance ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah okay second question obviously you did decide to buy securities it looks like 30somethingbillion the yield on the book went down a little bit i was just wondering if you can help us understand the premium and delta and also just where youre buying versus runoff front book back book at this point thanks terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so youre right we did step up the investment portfolio a lot it has to do with what i talked about earlier in that deployment of excess cash we made that deployment in the fourth quarter and while we did it in treasuries we swap it short and so that is why you see net interest margin coming down as well as the yields related to the investment portfolio coming down but we also did that because we want maximum flexibility as rates as longterm rates start to rise we would expect to kind of unwind that the benefit coming through in so thats kind of how were positioning it in terms of the overall investment portfolio the vast majority of it was shorter term and with the hedging strategies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc and just to follow up on that so when you say you unwind it do you mean that youre at the right size now or youd rather see it go into loans meaning like how do you think about the mix of the balance sheet and earning asset mix as you look further ahead terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah as we go forward i would expect that our investment portfolio will be relatively flat to fourth quarter levels thats kind of our expectation so the vast majority of earning asset growth is more on the loan side than it is in other areas ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay understood thank you operator your next question is from the line of john pancari with evercore terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning john us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hi john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning just on the loan growth front i heard the color you gave in terms some of the drivers you saw in the quarter on the commercial side et cetera the end of period balances came in a fair amount above average is that a good indicator as we model out and then separately anything you can attribute aside from just the continued macro strengthening to the notable strength you saw in end of period growth this quarter i mean its better than a lot of your peer banks any calling efforts or pricing campaign or anything else to call out on that front thanks terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so youre right john we did see some pretty significant growth in terms of end of period balances i think that that sets us up well with respect to one of the things its a little bit hard because you have libor transition everything else happening we dont know whether or not some of that is just people pulling forward libor a little bit into but when we talk to our customers i guess the thing that we see is that the underlying momentum and the underlying sentiment is pretty strong theyre actively out building their inventories again and all those sorts of things i think is when we think about kind of our baseline growth going into why were pretty optimistic but you are right the end of period balance growth was pretty significant for us and it wasnt because of any one specific thing that we were doing it was pretty broadbased across segments across categories and across geographies john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thanks terry thats helpful and then separately on the payment side just higher level given the clearly intensely competitive payments backdrop i want to see if you can kind of elaborate on us bancorps value proposition in the payments business as we continue to get this macro reopening or strengthening and as te spend rebounds as youve been flagging how would you characterize your positioning in terms of a value proposition for customers thanks andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah john so weve talked about the fact that were trying to really weave together our banking products together with our payment products in a comprehensive product set to help business banking customers basically manage the way theyre running their cash flows and their business on a daytoday basis us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 and thats our value proposition is that combination of payments and banking in easytouse dashboard information to help them run their businesses and manage their cash flows on a daytoday basis thats consistent with the travelbank acquisition that we made in the third quarter and other acquisitions bento and others that we made earlier in the year so thats the objective and well continue to focus on that and i would highlight the simplicity component of that the navigation the simplicity of use is a real key to that on a goforward basis john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks and then one followup to that andy just regarding that strategy do you think you need bolton deals or anything on the fintech side to continue to affect that strategy or do you think you have what you need andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp i think weve made a lot of investment both organic as well as acquisition in this capability were going to continue focus on it as terry mentioned but i think we have most of what we need we just continue to refine the capabilities and simplify the offering john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thanks andy andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure operator your next question is from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning bill andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hi bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning andy and terry i wanted to followup on slide within your business banking relationship at the last there was a modest increase in the number of customers that are now also payments customers from last quarter can you frame for us what the revenue benefit is of seeing that light blue region continue to grow over time and how high can that go us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp well again we think that we can get additional movement on both of those charts more banking customers using payments capabilities and more banking using payments we talk about the number of customers the revenue in that total bucket is about billion as we think about the penetration so thats the base were working with bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood and then maybe separately can you give a little bit of color on the process for converting some of those business banking customers the business banking only customers in that dark blue region to also be users of payment products just curious what the receptivity has been so far and have you come across any pushback from customers who may be using alternative payment solutions or has the customer base been broadly receptive andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp i would say that its early innings bill let me start there but i think the fundamental offering which is a simple easy to use combination of banking and payments products in one simple dashboard to help them manage their cash flows is a receptive thought from a business standpoint and thats really what were focused on again many of the customers have a banking product or a payments product but its weaving it together for that offering that were focused on and the receptivity of that has been pretty strong bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it and then lastly if i could squeeze in one final one on the increase in expenses attributable to competition and employee benefits can you parse out for us how much of that was a function of greater production versus inflationary pressures and how much of that upward pressure youd expect to persist terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i mean certainly what we ended up seeing for example in the capital markets business it was stronger so some of it is related to production incentives a fair amount of it in the fourth quarter is also related to performancebased incentives that are driven by the overall performance of the company so we certainly did see that i would say and maybe andy you want to comment as well certainly there is a lot of competition for talent thats out there and i think the pressure is especially when youre looking for high skilled areas in technology and development payments andor digital sort of space if youre in the hiring mode youre paying top dollar in order to be able to acquire that but that competition for talent is certainly increasing and out there andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp i think thats right terry and sometimes it takes a little longer and sometimes its a little bit more expensive but thats all been incorporated in the guidance that we offered for us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 and then as a reminder the other area that is challenging in this environment is entry level employees in the branch side and we get the benefit of having union bank combine with us this year which i think is a positive and as we talked about were committing to frontline employees on the branch side to employment and in this environment thats a positive bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful thank you for taking my questions andy and terry andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure operator your next question is from the line of david long with raymond james david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey david terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hey david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc the last remaining question i have is related to your reserve level and if you look back prepandemic i think you guys were targeting close to in reserves youre below that now just below that what is the right cecl level of reserves for us bancorp here and within your current reserves on the qualitative side how much do you have built in for maybe omicron or the pandemic still as part of that terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah david probably the way i would describe the last one is we still certainly believe that theres some level of uncertainty thats out there in the economy and so we take that into consideration when we go through the different scenarios that we kind of model out maybe kind of coming back to your first question what is the right level obviously thats going to end up based upon economic outlook and what happens with respect to credit quality but what i would say and youre right we started the prepandemic or the adoption of cecl at about when you end up looking at the mix of the portfolio and how it shifted were kind of right at were right at kind of the level that we had started with i guess is the way i would describe it us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 from a reserving point of view i would just kind of keep in mind from in terms of cecl you have to provide for loan growth on day one and so as loan portfolios start to grow across the industry i think that dynamic of reserve release will probably change a bit going into and again all of thats been kind of taken into consideration when were thinking about our baseline forecast for david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thank you i appreciate the color operator your next question is from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi im going to give the question and then ill give a windup and ill come back but my question is why are you not planning for even higher positive operating leverage in and as you know going back in time it was either some combination of jerry grundhofer jack grundhofer richard davis who said if you grow revenues faster than expenses great things happen and ive asked this question before for the last five years you guys have had negative operating leverage and during that time the stock price has barely moved as of yearend when banks are up almost half and the market has doubled so i think theres some relationship between the two so its good that youre guiding for positive operating leverage in i think that would be the first year in six years when you achieve that on a core basis but i think youre guiding for to revenue growth for this year so i guess that implies to expense growth which still seems to be a lot of spending i get it theres wage pressures so it seems to me that just from the benefit of rates you can get positive operating leverage which means the tech investments arent paying off to the bottom line i dont question whether theyre paying off youre a conservative trustworthy bank but are the tech investments paying off in a way that we as investors can see those and why dont you have higher positive operating leverage guidance thanks terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah well let me start with revenue just because i want to make sure were all on the same page earlier in the comments we talked about the fact that we expect total revenue growth in to be in the range of to and when you think about the components of it mike the net interest income is probably going to be at the higher end or maybe even a little above that range but fee income is probably going to be growing at the lower end or maybe a little bit below that range and the primary drivers when you think about fee income were still going to see in a rising rate environment mortgage banking revenue coming down and then in our lease residual portfolio end of term losses will be coming or end of term gains will be coming down a bit and that shows up in other income so i think that theres a couple of things that will mute the growth in fee income us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 the other thing that we talked about a little bit earlier is some changes in terms of our overdraft pricing and thats going to have a bit of a drag in terms of deposit service charges in terms of fee income so the range of growth again for in terms of total revenue is in that to range so maybe that kind of levelsets us with respect to our guidance or our expectations for revenue on the expenses and ill have andy kind of weigh in but at least basis points of positive operating leverage is kind of what our expectation or target is thats going to be balancing shortterm and longterm expectations in terms of investment but were very committed to being able to deliver at least that in so andy what would you add regarding the investment andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah mike and just to comment on your question overall weve been focused on making the necessary investments in our digital capabilities and our payments business as weve talked about that we talked to you about that and our objective is to position ourselves to be successful in this environment and i think we are were in a strong position and i think youre going to start to see the benefits both from a revenue growth standpoint as well as an expense efficiency standpoint particularly as we see the secular trends starting to increase overall so we made those investments eyes wide open very intentional at the same time balancing some shortterm expense opportunities on the operating core basis but i think on a goforward basis youre going to see positive operating leverages because of those investments mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so just to followup on the technology part when we think about your level of investments is that still increasing is it increasing at a slower rate and my understanding was your past investments were for foundation building nonrevenue areas and now the investments are for revenue areas so if you could just think in terms of the tech investing relative to the payoff where are you in terms of reaping those benefits andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah mike were level off so were not going to continue to see increases in those investments we did see some increases in the past five years but i think were at level set area right now number one number two we migrated from about defense and offense to offense right now so most of the investments were making are for revenuegenerating areas digital capabilities payments business banking and the other things we talked about terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp and the other thing that i would just add maybe is and this is really more kind of looking into we dont really see a need to increase the amount of investment even with bringing union bank into the us bank fold and thats because as weve talked about in the past most of this is just a lift and shift from their systems to ours and so well be able to leverage all the investment that weve been making and bring a lot of digital capabilities to their customer base us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks mike operator your next question is from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hey vivek how you doing vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi andy hi terry couple of questions credit cards your period end was up only i think like linked quarter you saw a bigger jump in certainly the fed weekly data any color on whats going on there why it was slow for you guys terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp in terms of credit card revenue credit card and debit card revenue vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc no credit card loans period end loans terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp oh yeah what was really being still impacted at least for us is the payment rate is still relatively high it did peak in the third quarter it came down just a little bit in the fourth quarter so until we start to see that measurably improve i think thats going to end up impacting growth rates of credit card loan balances our expectation though vivek is that those payment rates do start to migrate down nicely as progresses and so i do think that thats going to be a bit of a tailwind for us as we think about loan growth and it will also help net interest margin and obviously net interest income vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay second question the merchant processing decline in fees that you saw quarteroverquarter was that all omicron related coming in december or was there something else going on there too terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 yeah from third to the fourth quarter thats really i mean very very little is really related to omicron we did see a little bit of a slowup that was kind of late in december really what is happening there is that as sales continue to pick up in travel and that sector that tends to be a little bit of a different rate and so its more of a mix thing than it is anything else vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thank you operator your final question is from the line of erika najarian with ubs andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp morning erica terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hey erica erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc im trying to figure out given your outlook for positive operating leverage why the stock has opened so weakly so maybe following up on viveks question i think that the street had anticipated a much lower or lesser seasonal stepdown in payments so what happened with the interchange rate in the quarter terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so let me just kind of step back and when we think about kind of seasonality in the payments business overall usually from third to fourth quarter credit and debit card depending upon the amount of investment were making at that particular point in time is usually fourth quarter is a little bit better than third quarter but merchant and corporate payments typically fourth quarter is seasonally lower and thats fundamentally kind of what we saw both in terms of merchant and corporate now corporate ends up getting impacted by government spend which tends to be highest in the third quarter you get the effect of holidays impacting travel and those sorts of things with respect to payments and that sort of thing thats why that tends to step down so i think what we ended up seeing is fairly similar to what we would have expected in terms of the seasonality of the businesses erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc and the lower interchange rate that you mentioned on slide was there anything unusual there terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 yeah i mean again i think that that ends up getting impacted by the mix of the business so as travel grows the interchange rates and the margins associated with that particular business in the merchant acquiring is at narrower spreads and so as that is recovering it ends up impacting the margins a little bit erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and just to take another step back on your net interest income guide for three rate hikes midsingle digit what kind of deposit betas are you assuming i think everybody is very well aware that your corporate trust deposits are quite rate sensitive but has there been a change in your mix since the rate cycle and in general what have you baked into your nii guide for deposit repricing and what do you expect to actually happen terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so maybe at a high level typically what we see in the early stages of rising rates is that deposit betas dont move a lot in any of the different categories but you are right the corporate trust deposits tend to be a little bit more sensitive as you get into maybe the second or third rate hike and so when we think about maybe that first basis points we would expect deposit betas to probably be in that to range and then progressively getting a little bit stronger as the cycle continues and thats kind how we think about it now i would say that when we have looked at the mix of business we have had today versus lets say four five years ago we have kind of a strong mix of consumer base where we have seen a lot of the growth in deposits in was actually on the consumer side of the equation as opposed to some of the other businesses and so the deposit betas my expectation deposit betas especially in the early stages are probably a little bit lower than what we have experienced in the past erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and just maybe a last one for andy as we think about usb in a cost inflationary environment but in an environment as you said to mike where your investment spend is steady state what is really the underlying forget just but going forward next three years what is the underlying expense growth of this company and you had mentioned i think at a conference in that low is something that you could achieve from an efficiency standpoint is that something that can only be achieved with the deals that you have pending andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so erika part of achieving that is also getting back to a more normal revenue environment which were starting to migrate to with rates as we talked about in terms of our assumptions i would expect next year again that revenue growth to be well below that expense growth to be well below revenue growth and that positive operating leverage and i would expect us to achieve that on a goforward basis weve made the investments to position ourselves to be successful those investments are going to result in additional revenue but also importantly more efficiencies in the operations so as digital capabilities allow us to do things more effectively and more efficiently weve also optimized the branch network and were going to continue focus on that us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 so its sort of this balance erika of optimizing the current to continue invest for the future and thats what weve done and thats what well continue to do erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc okay thank you operator we do have a followup from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hey john john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi hey thanks two quick followups one for terry one for andy terry could you quantify the impact of the changes youre making the customer friendly changes to the nsf and od fees and what that might be for this year on a goforward basis as well and then andy just kind of wondering with all the dynamics in washington people are worried about the deal approval process for you and others getting delayed whats the cost of that to the organization are you doing a lot of prep work that gets put on hold and if you do end up waiting longer for approval what kind of cost is that to the organization and just some thoughts on that would be helpful thank you both terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so let me address the overdraft if you end up looking at our call reports i think our overdraft fees were about little less than of total revenue or million and on a fully implemented sort of basis we would expect that that impact of the changes were making is probably in that million to million and well probably end up realizing about of that next year and the other thing that i would just mention is that with fee waivers from a fee income standpoint and weve taken both these things into consideration fee waivers will help offset most of that john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay terry so i just next year does that mean like this year or terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah in we would realize about of the full effect john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yeah okay us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp and john were not incurring a lot of incremental expense right now as part of the integration efforts we have teams working on it but theyre not what i would call incremental in nature the impact of a delay would be really delaying the efficiencies and the cost takeouts thats we projected for you and that would be the principal impact john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it okay thanks andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure operator i will turn the call back over for any closing remarks jennifer ann thompson executive vice president directorinvestor relations and
