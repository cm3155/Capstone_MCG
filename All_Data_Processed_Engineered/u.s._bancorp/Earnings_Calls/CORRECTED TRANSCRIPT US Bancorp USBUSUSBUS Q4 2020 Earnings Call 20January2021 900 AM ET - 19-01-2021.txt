andrew j cecere chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks jen and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call following our prepared remarks terry jodi mark and i will take any questions you have ill begin on slide in the third quarter we reported earnings per share of revenue totaled billion in the fourth quarter and we delivered a record billion for the full year in spite of the headwinds caused by the low interest rate environment and the economic shutdowns due to the covid19 pandemic the value of our diversified business model was evident this past year as strength in our mortgage banking corporate trust and capital markets businesses offset pressure on our net interest margin which we expect to be stable in the nearterm and lower payments revenue due to reduced spend activity while uncertainty remains im encouraged by economic data that have generally been coming betterthan expected in recent months and an improving economic outlook given progress on the vaccine and the potential for additional governance stimulus us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 in the fourth quarter we saw a continuation of improving sales trends in our own payments data with the exception of some pressure on our merchant acquiring businesses european operations which was affected by the economic shutdown in the second half of the quarter while we expect european operations to continue to experience pressure in the first quarter we expect payments volume trends to continue to improve in line with consumer spend activity noninterest expenses were stable compared with the third quarter and we continue to target flat sequential expense levels as long as revenue growth remains challenging our balance sheet is in a strong position credit quality metrics were a little betterthananticipated this quarter and as expected we neither built nor released reserves in the fourth quarter we continue to maintain strong capital and liquidity positions which will allow us to continue to support our customers in this environment following the results of the fed stress test in december which indicated that we will continue to be subject to the minimum stress capital buffer we announced a 3billion common stock repurchase program with buybacks beginning this quarter slide provides key performance metrics in the fourth quarter we delivered a return on tangible common equity slide shows that we continue to see migration to the digital channel now let me turn the call over to terry who will provide more color on the quarter terrance r dolan vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp thanks andy if you turn to slide ill start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of fourth quarter earnings trends average loans declined by compared with the third quarter the decline was primarily driven by lower commercial loans reflecting continued paydowns by corporate customers partly offset by higher mortgage loan balances while paydown activity continues to slow we expect it to remain somewhat elevated in the early part of turning to slide average deposits increased compared with the third quarter and overall deposit mix continues to be favorable our noninterestbearing deposits grew while time deposits declined on slide you can see that credit quality continues to perform better relative to our expectations our net charge off ratio was in the fourth quarter which was down compared to basis points sic in the third quarter reflecting improvement in both commercial and credit card loss rates the ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was at the end of the fourth quarter compared with at the end of the third quarter our loan loss provision was million in the fourth quarter which was equivalent to our net chargeoffs during the quarter our allowance for credit losses as of december totaled billion or of loans the allowance level reflected our best estimate of the impact of slower economic growth and elevated unemployment partially offset by the consideration of benefits of government stimulus programs slide highlights our key underwriting metrics and loan loss allowance breakdown by loan category we have a strong relationshipbased credit culture at us bank supported by cash flow based lending that considers us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 sensitivity to stress proactive management and portfolio diversification which allows us to support growth through the economic cycle and produces consistent results turning to slide exposures to certain atrisk segments given the current environment are stable compared with the third quarter the top left table shows that the volume of payment relief declined meaningfully in the fourth quarter to of total loans slide provides an earnings summary in the fourth quarter of we earned per diluted share slide shows that notable items that impacted earnings in the fourth quarter of we had no notable items in the fourth quarter of turning to slide net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of billion declined compared with the third quarter reflecting lower average loan balances and a 10basis point decline in net interest margin the decrease in the net interest margin was primarily driven by higher cash balances which hurt our nim by basis points and higher premium amortization we expect stability in cash balances in the nearterm and given the current outlook for mortgage refinancing activity we believe that fourth quarter will prove to be the peak level for premium amortization expense slide highlights trends in noninterest income excluding notable items in the fourth quarter of noninterest income declined reflecting the impact of lower industrywide consumer spending activity on our payments businesses and deposit service charges partly offset by a strong mortgage banking revenue and higher commercial product revenue slide provides information about our payment services business lines including exposures to impacted industries yearoveryear payments revenue was pressured by reduced consumer and business spend activity compared with precovid levels however consumer sales trends generally improved throughout the fourth quarter albeit at a slower pace than we saw in the third quarter as expected card sales volumes were impacted by lower prepaid card volumes in the fourth quarter as payment activity related to the stimulus programs moderated in the fourth quarter merchant acquiring volumes were negatively impacted by the mix of sales volumes and a decline in spending activity in europe following an increased economic shutdowns related to covid19 commercial business spend within our corporate payments business continued to improve during the fourth quarter turning to slide on a linkedquarter basis noninterest expenses were stable as expected excluding notable items in the fourth quarter of noninterest expenses increased by on a yearoveryear basis growth was driven by higher compensation related to revenuegenerating business production technology and communication costs and covid19related expenses slide highlights our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio at december was ill provide some forwardlooking guidance for the first quarter of we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to decline in the lowsingle digits in part due to seasonally fewer days we expect our net interest margin to be relatively stable loan balances are likely to decline in the first quarter as ppp loans are forgiven and as corporations continue to use attractive capital markets funding alternatives and their strong cash flow to continue to pay down loans however we expect to start to see average loan balances growing in the second quarter us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 we expect mortgage revenue to decline on a linkedquarter basis in line with the industry as refinancing activity continues to moderate in the first quarter we expect both merchant acquiring revenue and corporate payments revenue to decline between to on a yearoveryear basis reflecting lower travel and hospitality volumes compared with precovid levels however we expect sales volume trends excluding travel and hospitality to continue to improve on a sequential basis in line with consumer and business spend activity the recovery of travel and hospitality spend will be dependent upon the timing and efficacy of vaccinations and changes in consumer behavior and business activities we expect credit and debit card revenue to increase in the lowdouble digits on a yearoveryear basis as growth in debit and prepaid card volumes more than offset lower travel and hospitality volumes we expect noninterest expenses to be relatively stable compared with the fourth quarter recently economic indicators have generally been better than market expectations and the outlook has improved in the past few months however given current uncertainties that exist related to recent trends in covid19 cases and related state level restrictions we expect nonperforming assets to remain elevated and we expect net chargeoffs to remain relatively stable in the first quarter we continue to expect net chargeoffs to increase in the second half of the year we expect the allowance for credit losses to begin to decline when theres more certainty regarding the economic outlook and the timing of when peak net chargeoffs will occur we will continue to assess the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses as conditions change for the full year we currently expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately ill hand it back to andy for closing

20jan2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question is from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning betsy terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i wanted to just understand a little bit about how you are thinking about the progression of loan growth as you go through the year and any kind of timing or drivers that you can speak to on the consumer side and the commercial side terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so betsy when we end up looking at loan growth we do expect as we said that in the first quarter its likely to be down because of the factors that we talked about but we are starting to see an inflection point i think theres better activity from an ma perspective than business spend in terms of capex it seems to be getting a little bit stronger so our expectation is that in the fourth quarter we kind of hit that inflection point and loans start to grow the biggest challenge for us has really been on the commercial side of the equation as weve gone through and its really when that starts to change in which overall loan growth starts to improve we do expect that as consumer spend and consumer behaviors continue to get stronger throughout the year some of the pressure on credit card will alleviate and so i do expect that as we get into second quarter and the second half of the year that credit card balances will start to come up as well and so that kind of gives you a little bit of flavor with respect to consumer and commercial betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and can you give us a sense on how youre thinking about your own appetite for ma weve had obviously in the industry quite a bit of consolidation activity over the past couple of quarters and i know from prior comments youve mentioned that look youll look at but you have a high bar just wondering given flush with capital liquidity and reserves is if that changes at all the opportunity set from your perspective for any ma us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey betsy this is andy our position on that is consistent with what we talked about well continue to look at opportunities for in addition to organic growth partnerships alliance like we did with state farm as well as ma if it meets the hurdles both from a financial and strategic sense to really increase our capabilities our scale our customer acquisition opportunities so well be openminded about that betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks and then just lastly on the state farm and the charlotte market expansion and some of the other locations where youre doing digitalfirst branchlite strategy could you give us a sense as to the kind of pace of benefit to growth that you anticipate those strategies will drive over the next couple of years andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah let me start on the state farm side so as you know that was an acquisition of card balances as well as deposits and so we would expect continued increases in both of those categories in addition to other opportunities in small business and other banking products with that alliance and that is going very well and the conversion was very smooth charlotte is also exceeding our expectations both in terms of extending current customer relationships as well as new customer acquisition we slowed a little bit in terms of the additional branches because of covid but were going to get back on track there so i would say in both cases theyre exceeding our expectations state farm a little bit more material just given the size than the charlotte acquisition charlotte increase betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp you bet operator your next question is from the line of john pancari with evercore isi terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning on the credit front just want to see if you can perhaps give us a little bit more color on your thought process regarding the reserve and why not release here i know you indicated that youre watching the macro backdrop what economic factors are you looking for to give you that signal around reserve releases and then separately i know you mentioned a peaking of chargeoffs so are you implying that you have to see that the chargeoff peak before you release i just want to see if you can elaborate there thank you terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah no yeah i mean maybe with respect to your second question no i dont think we need to see them peak i think we need to just have confidence in terms of when thats going to occur and i think that as time continues to move on i think that the economic outlook continues to get better and stronger i mean thats generally our expectation obviously unemployment and some of the high level economic factors continue to improve which is great i think the biggest thing that were waiting to see is just when we thought about the fourth quarter covid cases and things like that continue to be spiking there were a number of state economies that continue to put more and more restrictions on and we just kind of wanted to see that change or reverse which i think as were starting to see now thats positive but i think theres enough uncertainty and we want to be conservative as we think about the appropriateness of the reserve we want to see those some of those uncertainties alleviate john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right thank you and then separately on the loan growth front i hear you in terms of the likely inflection that youre beginning to see so as you think about it could you help us frame how you think loan growth could shapeup for the year as this inflection materializes and you see the strengthening through the year how should we think about full year loan growth versus gdp and then separately what do you think will be the greatest contributors to loan growth in terms of your asset classes for terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so relative to gdp obviously gdp is projected to be pretty strong so i think that were from a loan growth perspective i think the entire industry is going to see that lag a little bit behind that but as the economy continues to get stronger that loan growth will occur the biggest challenges i think that the industry has had and certainly that weve seen is that with very low rates strong companies with good cash flows have been able to go out to the markets and refinance andor use their own cash flows to pay down balances and so similar to what we saw the last time deposits theres a lot of liquidity out there with corporate america and they need to start using some of that liquidity themselves in terms of capital expenditure ma activity and all sorts of things us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 so the positive thing that we see now is that there are some green shoots associated with all those things and thats kind of the front end of loan growth starting to reverse and take off similar to what we saw last time andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thats right terry and i think the areas that like you just said the areas that probably offer the most opportunity are corporate loans as companies start to increase capex spend and ma accelerates and credit card spend starts to increase most of the credit card increased activity right now is transactors as opposed to those using balances john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks guys andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp you bet operator your next question is from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey john terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp hey john john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning andy terry gave some detailed guidance items for i guess at a higher level how are you thinking about what kind of year will be in terms of maybe headwinds and tailwinds on the revenue front and how youre thinking about managing for operating leverage andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah john so let me start by thinking about the year because i think one of the great attributes of our company is our diversified revenue model so we had headwinds in a couple of businesses like payments and nim offset by positives in mortgage and auto and our corporate trust business and our corporate and our commercial products businesses as we think about as i think about i think some of those headwinds particularly in payments will begin to dissipate we have some pressure in the fourth quarter because of our european operations but as you know us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 spend is starting to get back to normal particularly those areas outside travel and hospitality and i think that will start to come back particularly in quarters two three and four so that will be a positive mortgage continues to be strong maybe not as strong as what it was in but we have a high retail activity and new purchase activity given the expansion and the investments weve made there so i see positives there our trust businesses and investment will continue to do strong and then as terry talked about i think the other area of opportunity is in loan growth so as we think about the year that diversity of revenue is going to be very helpful and well continue to manage expenses given the revenue opportunities we have and as we said as we think about the first quarter we expect it to be relatively flat john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and in terms of the operating leverage achievability this year how would you handicap that i know its a tough call andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah a little its always our goal john let me start there were going to make the investments we need to but also recognize the current environment and try to perform as best we can given the revenue so positive operating leverage is always our goal and well strive for that in theres still a lot of uncertainty on the revenue front so well see how that plays out and well continue to give updates john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then terry maybe you could just weigh in on terms of capital management just remind us where do you think you should be running the company youve got a fair amount of excess here in terms of common equity tier and how you think about using buybacks beyond the first quarter over the course of time thanks terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so our overall target is and we typically operate somewhere between and in terms of tier ratio currently as you know were at so there is capacity and theres certainly opportunity for us to be able to bring that down i think the thing that well do is well continue to watch the uncertainties as the economic outlook continues to strengthen and earnings strengthen well take advantage of that but theres clearly plenty of opportunity from a capital management perspective to use that capital in a variety of ways john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research thank you operator your next question is from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey scott terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp hi scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co maybe terry i was hoping to ask you to expand a bit on one of the comments you touched on a second ago with regard to corporate liquidity just on deposits generally the whole worlds kind of awash in all these deposits just your top level thoughts on sort of when and how those kind of get drawn down if they come down just overall kind of what youre thinking there terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah certainly our expectation for is that from a policy perspective the federal reserve is going to continue to support a fairly high level or accommodative sort of environment our expectation is that deposits will continue to grow but certainly not maybe at the pace that they were in so thats going to be both an opportunity for us as we have the deposit flow to be able to look at investing for example in the investment portfolio et cetera but its also going to create a challenge from corporate america in terms of the amount of liquidity that they have r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thanks and then i was hoping you could touch on the commercial products revenue line a bit in a sense its kind of reversed some of the trends we see at peers where it sort of peaked earlier in the year and has been declining just curious if you can sort of talk about some of the underlying trends there and expectations terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah certainly when we think about commercial product revenue i mean the peak really was kind of in that second third quarter sort of timeframe for us our focus is really more on the high investmentgrade sort of customers as opposed to high yield and i think that because that mix in terms of whats happening in the marketplace ends up impacting our growth rates maybe relative to the industry fourth quarter theres always a little bit of seasonality for us it kind of comes down when we look at though were generally bullish with respect to capital markets activities us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you very much operator your next question is from the line of erika najarian with the bank of america andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning erika terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning my first question is just teasing out the nii outlook for the rest of the year as i think about your comments on loan growth and that fourth quarter will be peak for premium am should we expect the first quarter of to represent a bottom in net interest income and if so would you expect it to grow from there and sorry part b of this question is there any ppprelated income that youre putting into guidance terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah well maybe with respect to the last one i mean ppp obviously will impact net interest income as forgiveness occurs et cetera but its not a big driver associated with it for us maybe kind of coming back to your first question though our expectation from here is that starting point net interest margin is going to be stable certainly in the first quarter and our expectation is through the year i mean the pressures associated with the yield curve and all sorts of things that we saw last year actually will probably be helpful to us as we see that inflection point in terms of loan balances thats going to be a big driver in terms of the inflection point with respect to net interest income as well and then certainly as deposit flows if they continue to be strong we dont believe that we need to build any more liquidity and so well look at opportunistically reinvesting that in the market erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and as we think about the trajectory for paymentsrelated fee income million this quarter versus or fourth quarter versus million in as you think about your outlook for the global economy do you think you could go back to the run rate of million by or do you think that certain parts of payments will take a little bit longer to come back terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 yeah well generally i would say that when we think about the payments business were optimistic with respect to sales volumes as the year progresses certainly when we saw fourth quarter we saw good sales expansion in terms of credit card debit card and in the commercial spend so in our corporate payments space the domestic spend from a merchant perspective was kind of flattish in the fourth quarter but we do expect that to continue to expand and grow throughout the year i think the thing that getting back to your question though in terms of how quickly do you get back to precovid revenue levels a driver of that is just the travel and entertainment piece which is going to be probably a little bit more subdued at least in erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and if i could sneak a final question here and this is for andy as a followup to betsys question i do get a lot of questions from investors on whether or not us bank would do something more transformational from a nonorganic growth perspective seeing that your closest peers in terms of size did something either transformational or somewhat transformational and the question here is with assets at billion as of year end does the is billion a bright line for you as it indicates a different tier in terms of regulatory treatment andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp i think erika the short answer is i dont think about that as a bright line as we talked about were making investments across all of our businesses particularly in the digital channels we spent billion a year we have good scale but well look at opportunities to increase that scale and increase the customer acquisition opportunity across all the businesses so but there arent any bright lines in terms of what we look at or would do or wouldnt do erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure operator your next question is from the line of matt oconnor with the deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp good morning matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 first a clarifying question sorry if i missed it but the expense guidance i think you said stable in the first quarter versus but did you give full year guidance on costs terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah we didnt necessarily give full year guidance i would just kind of come back to what andy said and that our goal and our expectation is to manage expenses flat especially given the revenue environment and our target is always to achieve positive operating leverage its going to be challenging especially in the earlier part of the year matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then separately the alliance that you have with state farm just talk about some of the kind of the longer term opportunity there i think you brought in about billion deposits and a little bit north of billion of card loans but what do you think the revenue and earnings contribution from that can be over time terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah i mean so the dollars that you mentioned in terms of deposits and credit card is pretty close when we think about the business though and andy has talked about this before theres just a lot of opportunity and they have agents that are out there and theyre one of the biggest organizations with respect to small business customers and so when we think about it we think about theres opportunity in terms of deposit gathering theres certainly opportunity to enhance and improve the credit card program that has existed but we have a number of different initiatives that are going to focus around really expanding that and also expanding our relationship with them in terms of auto lending as well as small business opportunities matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and i guess what im getting at like if we look out five years like is this something that could all of a sudden start moving the needle right like so mortgage youre investing heavily in it for a number of years and all of a sudden activity picked up and its just massive number and even if its not sustainable it just shows kind of the fruits of the investments is this something that could move the needle or is it just kind of a building block along with some other initiatives thank you terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp no i think it is one of those things that can move the needle for us i mean any time you have access through agencies we think that thats very significant and the other thing matt is that weve invested a lot in digital capabilities we plan on leveraging all of those digital capabilities in order to be able to support their customers and ours so were very bullish and were very excited about the state farm alliance a lot more to come us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you operator your next question is from the line of ken usdin with the jefferies terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp good morning ken andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning guys good morning just a couple quick followups first of all on the point about premium am and at bottoming is there a way you can help us understand how much of an impact that currently is either in numeric terms or how much directional change there has been to get to this point given your point that its to the point that its bottoming terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah i mean we havent necessarily disclosed any dollars associated with premium amortization if you end up thinking about the basis points this quarter basis points of it is really related to card balances so the rest of it is really driven by premium amortization of significant amount so i think with respect to first quarter its or fourth quarter its really peaked first quarter its really and into its really going to track i think along with how refinancings occur within the mortgage industry ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and as you look into this year and consider the stimulus thats already started to flush through and potentially more stimulus how does that impact what you expect to see in the payments businesses at least domestically so does that net help revenues does it weigh on revenues and what other kind of through the income statement the effects do you are you anticipating given the prospect for even more stimulus to come through thanks terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah i mean when you think about stimulus certainly in the short term it helps our prepaid card businesses pretty significantly and with respect to the most recent one and if theres another round of it i think that that would continue to help throughout the year but i do think that it will and we did see in the last stimulus it does stimulate consumer activity in terms of buying and that is going to help and did help and will help our payments businesses as we think about so that to me is a very favorable thing us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 i think the other thing is that when you think about it from a credit standpoint the billion maybe was a little bit lower than what had been hoped for but its a nice start and i think theres most likely thoughts in terms of more to come the real question there is does that create a bridge for the consumer customers from a net chargeoff perspective to really keep those at base so to speak and i think that stimulus is going to be a positive both in terms of revenue as well as on the net chargeoff side if it occurs ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yes and just one followup on the european side of the payments business how quickly can does lockdown changes move into the revenue stream meaning that is it coincident does it start to lag from what youve observed in the prior the first lockdowns as opposed to this one thats happened now and wait on the fourth quarter results whats the experience that youve seen and would expect terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah the bounce back is pretty fast i mean it certainly is within that to days sort of timeframe you start to see it it does take a while for it to for that trajectory to get back but it does happen pretty fast and the other thing to keep in mind is the european revenue impact to us bank total revenue is probably around so its a very small amount in terms of total revenue and but well continue to see what happens with respect to the lockdowns ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks ken operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with the wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey mike terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp hey mike us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc well i guess you stand out unless i missed it so no reserve releases pandemicrelated or did i miss that you built up about billion of reserves the prior three quarters but no releases in the fourth quarter did i get that right and if so why no releases terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah mike that is correct when we end up looking at the allowance for credit losses we still see as i said a little bit earlier i think we end up looking at the uncertainties that exist out there at least existed out there at the end of the year and just have what we want to be able to see is we want to see kind of a reversal of some of the restrictions and a reversal associated with some of the covid cases and i think that were starting to see that happening which is a good sign but thats one of the reasons that we really kind of held back with respect to the allowance for credit losses at this point mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so its not your clients its just youre just being conservative with the environment terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp well yeah i think its just the uncertainty in the environment wed like to see a few of those continue to improve mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay my bigger question relates to your presentation from december which talks about recreating the ecosystem and going after more of the payments business with your middle market companies and small businesses and basically improving the share of payments with your business customers and i didnt completely understand the endgame for that any specific metrics around how youre trying to improve share for example one metric could be you have x percent share of the payments business with your middle market companies and you want to move it to y or anything concrete that you can put around what feels like a newer or enhanced strategic direction and that coincides i guess with your closing of onefourth of your branches and if you can give an update on that also andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah mike this is andy let me start with the branches so we did complete the branch closures early in january so as we talked about we were just over branches were down about so just over branches and thats really a function of consumer behaviors as you saw from the chart of our customers are using the digital channel those using the branch channel while still important and still seeking advice and consult its down to about so theres a behavior change thats accelerated as a result of the pandemic and the closures reflect that thats number one us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 on the small business business banking front i think its a very significant opportunity we have a great payments business we have a great banking business and weaving those two together to offer a full set of capabilities for that ecosystem is critically important and i think there is three metrics that were going to focus on payments customers that add banking capabilities banking customers that add payments capabilities and new customer acquisition and we havent articulated those goals but we have goals for all three of them and well update as we go forward but i think its a huge opportunity mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and as far as last question extra spending i mean if you closed all your branches its done in january so you certainly have savings your tech spend went up quarteroverquarter in the fourth quarter so are you looking to increase your tech spend while you create this kind of newer ecosystem andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so mike we talked a little bit about our guidance on expense which is relatively flat and as you think about that flat expense guidance theres really two components one is achieving savings through optimization on the current business model while at the same time investing for the new so were going to be able to continue to invest to allow us to expand in these areas while retaining flat expenses by saving on the current business model mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp you bet operator your next question is from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp hey vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey andy hey terry andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 thanks for taking my questions im good thanks couple of questions firstly branch closures you obviously did a lot in early jan whats your thinking for the rest of the year are you done for this year do you think theres more to come and in line with that given that this is all about consumer behavior with the pandemic how is that changing your thinking about opening more branches i know you said you want to open more in charlotte but that whole expansion strategy do you need as many branches if you could sort of talk to both those pieces andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure vivek so as you think about charlotte we were targeting a dozen branches if you think about the twin cities we have nearly to so the way we would open in a new market would be significantly different than the current business model in terms of the number i think were at a relatively stable point right now well continue to look at opportunities to optimize branches at the same time opening new branches but i wouldnt expect substantial changes in the near term vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great different question what percentage of your merchant processing revenues is small to midsized merchants versus the large terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp well i dont necessarily have that at my fingertips but if you end up just kind of looking at the overall mix we have a pretty good mix of small and mediumsized sort of businesses that are part of that equation and they have tended to be kind of omni distribution sort of merchants or customers as well one of the things we continue to expand and grow is our ecommerce sort of capabilities and that has grown very nicely over the last year or so vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc would you expect that they are half your business over half what would you guess terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah if i were to venture a guess id say maybe a little bit it depends upon how you end up characterizing small and medium et cetera i think thats the thing im struggling with here a little bit vivek andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp vivek one thing id add because i think where youre going in terms of the recovery one way we look at it a lot and very focused on is the component of our merchant acquiring that is travel entertainment and airline and a year ago back in that was nearly and so it was and today its about so the decline thats occurred has been principally in that area as opposed to small or large business its been in that focused area of us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 travel and airline everything else has actually got back to normal and that is where the opportunity exists for continued improvement in spend as we think about the future vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great all right thanks and one last one if i may mortgage banking stayed still very strong i know its down im presuming youve been able to pass on the gse refi fee thus far is that the case and whats the plan for that as you look forward terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah that would be the situation of the case again when we think about the mortgage banking business too we talk a lot about the refi but the thing that id maybe remind people is that weve made a lot of investment in that business in terms of the purchase money purchase mortgage and that continues to do very well i think if you end up looking at the production of applications in the last quarter it was about purchase versus refinancing so i know that people will look at that as a headwind but i actually think that thats an area of opportunity as we think about the future vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc all right okay great thanks thank you very much andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks vivek operator your next question is from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning good morning thank you for all the color that you guys have given on payments but i wanted to followup with a bigger picture question broadly speaking how would you guys respond to concerns of some investors that usbs merchant acquiring business is tethered to the physical pointofsale and is competitively disadvantaged against some of the more digitally native names like paypal square and stripe and also more broadly if you could discuss what usb is doing to compete against those kinds of players andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yes good questions bill and twofold number one is most of the investments weve made and most of the expansions occurred over the last two years has been on the ecommerce side of the equation its not just e commerce its really capabilities to help those businesses run their businesses us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 and i think one of the advantages against those payments players you described is our banking business and thats why were so darn focused on weaving together banking and payments because those customers need not just the payments mechanisms they need small loans they need deposit advice and acceptance so they need a full array of services and i think if we can offer those in a convenient easy fashion that solves their problems and helps them run their business so i think thats where our advantage is and thats that combination of banking and payments its so darn important bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks andy thats super helpful color if i could squeeze in another one im sorry if you guys discussed this already on the securities portfolio but what kind of reinvestment rates are you guys seeing relative to what we saw in the fourth quarter and maybe a little bit on what kind of opportunity a steeper curve could represent terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah certainly when we see the securities portfolio i mean the differential from our reinvestment has shrunk some relative for example to third quarter fourth quarter it got a little bit better and that we would expect to probably get better as well i do think as the long end of the curve starts to come up i think that that is another inflection point its just a matter of kind of what the timing of that is bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thanks very much for answering my questions terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah thank you bill andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thank you operator your final question is from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning andy good morning terry andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc a question for you on the outlook for loan loss reserves clearly you guys have always been very conservative and you still are as we look out into the future maybe terry can you share with us i think if i read the number correctly your reserves to loans today are about and thats of course higher than where we were in january when you guys had your cecl adjustment and i think it was about do you eventually see the reserve to loan number coming back to where it was prepandemic at about terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah it will be kind of really around timing but certainly when we look at the overall mix of our business and our portfolio and our underwriting that to us makes sense as we get through the pandemic sort of environment gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then andy maybe a bigger picture question clearly your guys outlook is maybe a little more conservative than some of your peers but there seems to be the expectation that as the vaccines are widespread hopefully by the middle of the year that the economy will come back strongly in the second half there are calls for real gdp growth of to the equity markets are at record levels as you know when you go down the elevator at night what risks do you worry about as you think about the next to months andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp well the principal risks are the ones you described which are the economic risks the headwinds and the flat yield curve but i think the economic headwinds that we faced in the second half of are starting to dissipate for sure and starting to come back and again gerard we mentioned we have a diversified revenue stream and different businesses do well in different environments and those businesses that struggled with some of the headwinds that we saw regarding to nim and loan growth and payments i think it will start to turn the other way as we start to see the recovery for all the reasons you described so and then different businesses will be impacted in different ways so the value of diversified revenue stream really is very helpful and one of the ways that it helps us perform in whatever economic cycle were in but the principal thing that we all think about is how the stimulus and how the actions of the government as well as some of the forbearance and plans by the banks will help us get back into a normal economic recovery i think thats the principal area of concern for all of us right now gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2021 andrew j cecere a
