quality metrics the pace of which has been better than expected net revenue totaled billion in the second quarter as expected net interest income grew in the second quarter while our fee businesses

dividend in the third quarter payable on october slide provides key metrics including a return on tangible common equity of slide highlights continued strong trends in digital activity now let me turn the call over to terry who will provide more detail on the quarter terrance r dolan chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp thanks andy if you turn to slide ill start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of second quarter earnings trends average loans were stable compared with the first quarter in line with our expectations strong demand for installment loans drove other retail loan growth while ci loans increased supported by strong growth in assetbacked lending partly offset by continued paydown activity in other ci categories we saw a decline in residential mortgage loans audio gap increased paydowns average credit card loan balances were stable compared with the first quarter as the payment rates remained high at reflecting the significant level of consumer liquidity however periodend balances increased on a linkedquarter basis as we saw some pickup in activity toward the end of the quarter turning to slide average deposits increased compared with the first quarter and grew by compared with a year ago reflecting the significant level of liquidity in the financial system our overall deposit mix continues to be favorable in the second quarter our noninterestbearing deposits grew linked quarter while time deposits declined by time deposits now account for of total deposits compared with a year ago slide shows credit quality trends which continue to be better than expectations our net chargeoff ratio totaled in the second quarter compared with in the first quarter the ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was at the end of the second quarter compared with at the end of the first quarter we released reserves of million this quarter reflective of betterthanexpected credit trends and a continued constructive outlook on the economy our allowance for credit losses as of june totaled billion or of loans the allowance level reflected our best estimate of the impact of improving economic growth and changing credit quality within the portfolios slide provides an earnings summary in the second quarter of we earned per diluted share these results include the reserve release of million slide net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of billion increased compared with the first quarter primarily driven by higher yields and volumes in our investment securities portfolio and favorable earning asset and funding mix shifts partly offset by lower loan yields our net interest margin increased basis points to the impact of lower loan yields was more than offset by a favorable mix shift in both our investment portfolio and funding composition as well as lower premium amortization expense slide highlights trends in noninterest income compared with a year ago noninterest income was relatively stable as the expected decline in mortgage banking revenue and commercial product revenue was offset by us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 higher payments revenue trust and investment management revenue treasury management fees and deposit service charges on a linked quarter basis noninterest income increased driven by higher business and consumer spending activity reflecting broadbased reopenings of local economies both yearoveryear and linked quarter mortgage banking revenues were negatively impacted by slowing refinancing activity and reduced gainonsale margins linked quarter mortgage revenue growth of was primarily driven by the favorable linked quarter impact of a change in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights net of hedging activities slide provides information on our payment services business in the second quarter total payments revenues increased versus a year ago and was higher by compared with the first quarter each of our three payments businesses saw strong revenue growth on both a linked quarter and a yearoveryear basis reflective of the strengthening economy and the increased spend activity credit and debit card revenue increased on a yearoveryear basis driven by stronger credit card sales volumes and higher prepaid card processing activities related to government stimulus programs sales volume trends which are the primary driver of payments revenues are encouraging the bottom charts on slide indicate that as of the end of june total sales volumes across each of the three payments businesses exceeded comparable levels certain pandemicimpacted spend categories continued to lag in particular corporate te however consumer travel and hospitality spend volumes are rebounding faster than we expected and the pace of improvement in recent weeks has accelerated a bit turning to slide noninterest expenses was relatively stable on a linked quarter basis as expected slide highlights our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio at june was compared with our target cet1 ratio of given improving economic conditions in the second quarter we bought back million of common stock as part of our previously announced billion repurchase program ill provide some forwardlooking guidance for the third quarter of we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to be relatively stable compared to the second quarter we expect total payments revenues to be relatively stable compared to the second quarter but will continue to track favorably on a yearoveryear basis while we expect sales volumes growth in each of our three payments businesses to continue to improve sequentially prepaid card volumes are expected to decline toward prepandemic levels as the impact of government stimulus dissipates we expect noninterest expenses to be relatively stable compared to the second quarter credit quality remains strong over the next few quarters we expect the net chargeoff ratio to remain lower than normal for the full year of we currently expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately ill hand it back to andy for closing remarks andrew j cecere chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks terry our second quarter results came in as expected and there are many reasons we are optimistic as we head into the second half of the year the economy continues to recover towards prepandemic activity levels and the consumer and business spending activity continues to improve credit quality trends have been a positive us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 surprise and our payments volumes have come back a bit faster than we expected as recently as a few months ago we are well positioned for the cyclical recovery that we expect to play out over the next several quarters more importantly we are wellpositioned to deliver on superior growth and industryleading returns on equity over the next several quarters given our business mix our comprehensive and holistic payments and banking capabilities and our expansive distribution model supported by worldclass digital capabilities id like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication throughout the year we will now open up the call to qa question and answer section operator operator instructions and your first question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning betsy terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi i just wanted to dig in a little bit to the guidance and some of the discussion there around the payments business i think you mentioned that payments came in a little faster than expected i know you were expecting that the payments revenues would accelerate in so it came in a little faster than youre expecting but then i think youre mentioning that youve got it flat expecting it to be flat qonq but i just want to dig into that is that because the acceleration rate you think is slowing down here or are you being conservative with the guide for terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i think its a combination of things betsy and maybe just if i kind of talk a little bit about payments again overall i think three things to kind of keep in mind in terms of the payments businesses in total and that is the sales volume momentum continues to be very strong especially when you exclude the airline and te sort of activities airlines and te continue to be lagging but are getting stronger in fact if you listen to any of the airline sort of quarterly results the leisure travel is really back to prepandemic levels and business travel is starting to pick up us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 pretty nicely the other thing i would just say is that corporate te continues to be the one area that is still down quite a bit but it is improving a little bit faster than maybe what we had expected the one area i would just say or highlight is let me talk a little bit about maybe the three components if we first take a look at credit and debit card revenue again sales volumes are particularly strong in that area as an example credit sales in the second quarter we would expect it to continue maybe a slightly lower rate but credit sales are about when you exclude travel and entertainment debit card sales are about so the second quarter was particularly strong and we expect that type of momentum to continue the one thing that i would say though is that third quarter of last year was the peak with respect to prepaid card processing revenue and that has been slowly normalizing but we really kind of expect third quarter to be back closer to what would be a normal level the second thing that is going to end up impacting credit and debit card revenue for the third quarter is that we are taking the opportunity to invest in growth so were giving up some nearterm growth opportunity in order to be able to generate customer account acquisition the other thing that i would just mention maybe from a prepaid card perspective on a normal basis it represents about to of that overall credit and debit card revenue category and its that factor of it normalizing plus the investment thats really going to cause the overall payment revenues to be fairly stable relative to the second quarter betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so even though youve got te that is ramping the prepaid is really offsetting that as you go into thats really the conclusion terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah thats right betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right got it and then maybe you could talk a little bit about the credit box and how youre thinking about that with regard to not only the card space but the overall loan book terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so i think weve mentioned this last quarter but were now back to fundamentally the credit box that we had on a prepandemic level really across all the product categories betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and your ci was good especially if i consider the ppp so just wondering whats going on there to generate the strength that you saw in the quarter terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 yeah its a couple of different things we mentioned that assetbacked securitization lending has been strong and its been continuing to improve i think thats one of the things that we are seeing in that particular category the one thing though that were continuing to watch is that the payoffs or paydowns continue to occur and thats simply because of the rate environment the capital markets activities continue to be fairly strong and i also think its going to take a little bit of time for ci to develop simply because of the amount of liquidity that customers have and are continuing to generate betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay thanks so much terry thanks andy andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks betsy operator your next question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp morning matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so good to see costs flat linked quarter even though you had the beat in fees and you guided to kind of similar in the third quarter but i asked last quarter as the fees pick up hopefully driven by payments and if rates rise and loan growth picks up can you get outsized operating leverage and last quarter you thought you could and that was the plan the hope i know you dont give kind of formal guidance beyond one quarter out but thematically is that still the case that while theres investments to make you would hope for outsized operating leverage as the revenues pick up terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i mean we certainly have that expectation i mean weve made some very nice investments across many different categories within our business whether its in the mortgage business we see the benefit especially as that starts to shift away from refinancing toward the purchase mortgage our digital capabilities there will be very beneficial i think that we continue to see strong growth with respect to auto endofterm gains the payments businesses where weve made investments for example in treasury management sort of capabilities and things like that that is starting to pay off so the answer is yes i think we feel very confident that the investments that we have been making are going to allow us to generate some nice fee growth as we think about the future us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp and matt were going to continue to manage expenses relatively stable with the headwinds we have in revenue like you talked about the flat yield curve and margin and loan growth being a little bit challenged but well manage flat in this environment and then positive operating leverage in a more normal revenue environment matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just separately you recently announced a deal to acquire part of this pfm maybe just what is that exactly how does it fit into usb and i had to remind myself i think you had owned an asset management company that you sold about years ago faf so is this kind of a get back into a certain business that you exited or a different part of the investment in wealth management segment andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah matt so like you referenced a few years ago we did sell but that was equities and bond business we continue to retain the money market business and in fact have about billion of assets under management and so this essentially doubles that base with a particular focus on government which is the space around government investment pools and it fits very nicely into our government banking business our treasury management and particularly our corporate trust business so its a nice addon to a business were already in that gives us additional scale and customer acquisition matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure operator your next question comes from john pancari with evercore isi andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning good morning back on the payment side just as we continue to see the rebound that youre flagging play out i guess can you help us think about how you view the longterm growth potential the business perhaps beyond this year what is a reasonable growth rate to expect out of the various payments business and then separately are you viewing competition in the space any differently today than a couple of years ago it certainly seems like its intensifying so how do you view that as a dynamic as well thanks us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so let me just talk about maybe how we think about it on a longerterm basis certainly when we think about the payments businesses we believe that midsingle digits is a good target for us to be able to achieve in that particular space we have been making some as i said some really nice investments the techled fees for example within elavon our merchant acquiring space today represent about of the overall elavon revenue or merchant acquiring revenue and its growing at about that pace as well so its a nice business investment that weve made and techled will contribute to the overall investment as we go and then i do think that our investments in the rps digital account acquisition and our treasury management space and all those different types of investments on the b2b realtime payments are going to have a real opportunity for growth in treasury management as an example about half of that revenue today represents what i would call digital or forwardleaning type of revenue products as opposed to legacy products and they grow at about a to clip so i think that theres some real opportunity for midsingle digits or in that ballpark anyway andy andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp i agree terry and i think in addition to what you said which is sort of the current case i would point to our focus on business banking and this weaving together of the banking and payments capabilities into a comprehensive product set and as a reminder we have just over million business banking customers with less than a penetration i think it presents a lot of opportunity and weve talked about the fact that we expect to grow that revenue base to over the next few years so i think thats an additional opportunity in addition to what terry talked about john pancari q analyst evercore isi yeah right great thanks thats helpful then separately on the capital front the cet ratio at your internal target still sits at and how should we think about migration down towards that level in terms of timing what type of factors are influencing the pace that you migrate back towards that target thanks terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah great question and currently i think we have capacity under our buyback program its about a billion program and we have purchased about half of that thus far so well continue to purchase under that buyback program and then we certainly have the opportunity to be able to expand that or replace it in the future we think about deploying or utilizing capital kind of along the various priorities organic growth being really the top priority and the dividend as andy talked about earlier then we look at inorganic sort of opportunities to the extent that they might present themselves or product sort of capabilities and then the buyback program so thats kind of how we end up prioritizing it from a timing standpoint i think were going to continue to watch both from an economic standpoint but were just going to be opportunistic in the market when it makes sense to be buying back shares us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks terry operator your next question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp sure r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co i was hoping to sort of revisit this notion of the sort of competitive positioning in payments i think one of the big things that i hear on usb is that the payments business is just such a wonderful differentiator visàvis other banks but sort of the volume trends versus some of your fintech competitors arent as striking now a lot of them are much newer companies and stuff like that so it makes sense but would just be curious to hear your thoughts on sort of competitive positioning overall and where you think youre doing especially well but might need some work conversely as well andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so scott this is andy as terry talked about the investments were making on the digital front and the capabilities around software and techled and i think that has really put us in a great spot but i think even more important is this weaving together like i referenced earlier the banking and the payments into a comprehensive product set to help these companies run their businesses so that banking payments combination i think is particularly important and the fact that we have strong banking capabilities and strong payments capabilities is i think how were going to differentiate ourselves and its on two fronts one is to extend the current capabilities to current customers but more importantly to achieve customer acquisition at a higher growth rate so thats where were focused on r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect thank you and then maybe separately terry you talked about maybe the degree to which youre seeing sort of institutional deposit inflows related if at all to like the largest banks may be turning them away given their own sort of thresholds indiscernible and so whats the way youre thinking about the potential for sort of kind of customer acquisition on the deposit side there in the institutional area but particularly when theres not necessarily a ton of robust loan growth to immediately kind of utilize those funds with us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah a great question its a little hard to know exactly what the implications are of other actions that it has on us but maybe when i end up looking at where our growth is occurring the strongest growth is really coming from our consumer and business banking segment rather than on the institutional side the institutional has actually probably been staying relatively flat or even coming down based upon rates that are being offered et cetera but the strong growth is really on the consumer side and we think that thats because of our digital capabilities and customer acquisition sort of strategies and then the liquidity that customers have r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect thank you guys very much for taking the questions operator your next question comes from bill carcache with wolfe research andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning andy and terry i wanted to followup on the comments you just made and ask maybe a little bit more specifically if you could sort of juxtapose for us the growth outlooks in consumer and commercial and talk a little bit about maybe where you see the greater potential for inflection given all the moving parts that were seeing around the supply chain dynamics and pentup demand and all the liquidity and all of that would love to hear your thoughts as you kind of look at those businesses next to each other andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah so bill the opportunity on the consumer side i think continues to be the economic recovery thats occurring and the strength in payments and terry talked about the trends across all three of the payments categories particularly card spend and even things like travel and entertainment while still lower or weaker than prepandemic levels coming back strong and rapidly so thats a positive and then we have sort of the secular trend that i talked about which was in the business banking side which is this combination of payments and business and so those the economic recovery on the consumer side and the secular focus on the business side would be the two areas i would emphasize bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thank you and then i was hoping that you could give your thoughts on the open banking aspect of biden the executive order making it easier and cheaper to switch banks by requiring banks to allow customers to take their financial transaction data with them to a competitor just curious if you had any broad highlevel thoughts on that us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah one of the reasons were investing in all these digital capabilities is because we want to be the very best in terms of digital and have great capabilities to serve our customers and that combined with the human element finance is complicated and having people in addition to digital i think is critically important so thats how we think were going to effectively compete in the long run and thats what were focused on bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it and if i could squeeze in one last one is there any concern around the child tax credits and i guess you talked about the improving payments revenues are sort of stable but improving and like theres been this whole dynamic with payment rates being elevated but hope that they get better do the child tax credits sort of extend the recovery push it further out or maybe any thoughts on how you guys are viewing that terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i think maybe one of the ways to think about it is the child tax credit they typically end up getting a great big lump sum and now when you spread it out kind of on a quarterly basis or more throughout the year i think it just gives people the opportunity to be able to utilize that maybe a little bit more effectively in terms of paying their lifestyle sort of bills so i dont think i dont it might change in terms of timing as much as anything but i dont think its necessarily a major driver andy do you have a different perspective andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp i agree terry we actually weve talked about the payment rate being a high to in the second quarter but its also stabilized it was growing for a number of quarters which has put pressure obviously on the card balances but stabilization on that payment rate combined with the increased spend i think will perhaps lead to growth in the next few quarters on the card side bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thank you for taking my question andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah operator your next question comes from john mcdonald with autonomous research andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 hey john terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hey john john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning terry was wondering if you could unpack a little bit the outlook for next quarter nii just kind of thoughts on puts and takes on margin versus volume as you look at the stable outlook for net interest income terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i mean a big part of that is just what rates have done but let me kind of step back i mean we had a really nice quarter in terms of the growth that was driven in part by the investment portfolio growth that we had in the second quarter we were opportunistic in investing when the 10year was kind of in that range and we put some cash to work at that particular point in time we also saw some benefit associated with the premium amortization expense being a little bit lower when we think about the second or the next quarter i think maybe the puts and takes are going to be we expect loan growth to be relatively flat but modestly stronger than what we saw on a linked quarter basis in the second quarter our expectation is that the long end of the curve comes up a little bit but is not much and then i think that the margin is relatively stable so i think when we end up looking at the various components of it thats kind of how we think about it loan growth we are seeing it in that assetbacked securitization lending we do expect consumer lending to get a little bit stronger because of the consumer spend activities that are taking place andy talked about the payments rates have kind of hit we think a high in the credit card space we saw some nice growth right at the end of the june timeframe and while theyll continue to be at elevated levels i think that the fact theyre not increasing and maybe coming down a little bit will help credit card balances as well and then maybe when we also think about loan growth auto lending continues to be very strong and i think its really kind of a combination of all those different types of things john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and not sure if you touched on it yet but any thoughts on the outlook for mortgage banking volumes and revenues in the near term terry terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah mortgage banking obviously it hit its high in the second quarter of last year and then its been coming down simply because the refinancing activities have been slowing over time when we think about the mortgage banking business it has been influenced by that refinancing but today the mix of purchase versus refinancing is about purchase refinance us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 mortgage banking revenues are kind of back to what i would call prepandemic sort of level that we saw in the fourth quarter of first quarter of kind of in that ballpark so i actually think that mortgage banking is kind of back to that prepandemic level and the investments that weve made in our digital capabilities our retail mortgage business and all those sorts of things will help us compete we have been taking market share especially in the purchase mortgage side of the equation i think thats all kind of beneficial john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks john operator your next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning ken kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi good morning guys i was wondering if i could followup on pfm and i know details werent released in the press release but can you help us think about just what the type of contribution it might bring to revenues pretax income earnings et cetera and use of capital terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah again we havent necessarily disclosed all of that i mean from a capital usage perspective it would be relatively insignificant i think that one of the benefits maybe of acquiring at this particular point in time is that if we do start to see rising rates the benefit of recapturing some of the fee waivers that that business has been experiencing and thats all upside to how we were thinking about the business when we ended up acquiring it so again a nice acquisition for us because it gets us into that local government investment pool market we will have a number one market share in that particular space but overall from a company perspective its just complementary to the money market asset management business that we have kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc and on that point terry do you know what your second quarter fee waivers were in the core trust and investment management business and how much that might have changed sequentially and should it improve terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp million was  up a little bit from  and i think million is going to be the peak us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc right okay last one you mentioned in the press release that the first quarter nii second quarter nii was helped by higher loan fees im just wondering how much was that of a helper and also if you have any color on what the delta in just ppp loans was as you exited the quarter terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i mean the delta first to second quarter wasnt significant and when we think about second to third quarter we dont think that that is going to be significant in terms of for example fee recognition kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc for ppp specifically terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp for ppp specifically yeah kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and were loan fees meaningful in the second quarter terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp not really i mean no i mean any time you have recoveries you have a little bit of a benefit associated with that but nothing of significance kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay understood thanks terry operator your next question comes from david long with raymond james david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 the loan growth for your auto portfolio has been pretty strong i just wondered if you can provide some color on the split between growth in making loans to new vehicles versus used vehicles andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp most of our activity is from our dealer finance business and its mostly new activity there is some used in there but i would say majoritys new david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it got it okay and then as it relates to the mortgage banking do you have the dollar amount of the favorable impact from the msr valuation adjustment in the second quarter terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah im trying to remember in the first quarter i think the net impact was about million kind of in that ballpark so that would be kind of the benefit that we end up seeing the first quarter it was million and it was its probably about million of differential andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah i think thats right terry its about million in the first quarter negative and about million in the second quarter ph i guess terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yes david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thank you operator your next question comes from vivek juneja with jpmorgan andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning vivek terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hey vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 hi andy hi terry a couple of questions first one you mentioned youd be giving up some nearterm growth in the card side due to investments can you talk a little bit about what investments and for how long and why that would slow down your card growth terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah well anytime youre going through both a customer account acquisition as well as the volumes are expanding et cetera your rebates residuals your card acquisition costs all those sorts of things are part of that revenue line and so the extent that that is ramping up its going to moderate the quarteroverquarter sort of growth i mean vivek were always constantly sort of investing in that business its just kind of relative from one quarter to the next how much were investing at any particular point in time we just think that given the strong sales momentum and the opportunity at this particular point in time to make those investments we just think its the right thing to do vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and then that would hurt third quarter but then that should from a comparison standpoint not be a drag or flip the other way in the fourth quarter is that how we should think about that terry from a timing standpoint as we model out quartertoquarter terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i dont think that the amount of the drag increases in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter but thats right vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay different topic you said lower mbs premium amortization helped a little in the second quarter any color on what it was or how we can compare where you are versus prepandemic so how much more room for that to come down terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i mean i would expect that the reduction in premium amortization in third quarter will be kind of similar to what we saw in the second quarter and the margin impact over time as it was going up was somewhere between and basis points kind of on a linked quarter basis so i think that you could kind of expect that same sort of benefit in for example the third quarter it starts to dissipate or moderate as we kind of get out into late fourth and into vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thank you us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks vivek operator your next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo securities terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey your tech spend is up yearoveryear if you look at the yeartodate numbers so the question is how much do you think youll spend this year what percent increase do you expect what are you spending it on and any more meat on the bones you can give on combining the banking and payment businesses terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so maybe from an overall tech spend we talked about the fact that we make investment of about billion in technology broadly about half of that is capital expenditure about half of that is what i would call kind of run rate if you will we have been running at that level for some period of time and the increase that youre seeing mike is really as youre making those investments it takes a little bit of a time for it to kind of get into the run rate if you will i would expect that we dont anticipate when we think about going forward that that that tech spend amount will change a lot what we end up focusing on i think has been changing over time for example if i were to step back three four years ago it was less offense more defense and today its probably offense related around our digital initiatives tech stack modernization those sorts of things as opposed to having to play defense so i think the shift is good because its more forwardleaning and more revenuegenerating sort of activities as opposed to defense and i think key go ahead im sorry mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so run the bank change the bank youd say now change the bank is like versus run the bank terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i think thats a good way of describing it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then you guys i ask this question every quarter and you seem to be playing it very close to the vest you clearly have been investing a lot in combining the payments and the banking businesses to give i think you said on one call to be more chimelike or go after chime not them specifically but the concept can you give us any more meat on the bones as far as what the strategy is when were going to see it you said you want to us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 serve existing clients better but also capture a lot more new customers and i dont know where to look for that in the external releases or when we should look for it andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah mike its andy were spending a lot of time on that internally and ill tell you what were going to put something in the earnings release and deck by the end of the year to give you more information on this we are looking at it on a regular basis its one of our top priorities i think its a huge opportunity both from an increased penetration to current customers as well as customer acquisition and well give you more on this before the end of the year mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right ill look forward to it thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp thank you operator your next question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp indiscernible hey scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thanks for taking my followup just curious in the president bidens executive order last week some language regarding increased scrutiny on bank transactions just curious if you have any sort of early thoughts on kind of ramifications or how it might or might not change your calculus on thinking about any opportunities that might come up andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure scott so as weve talked about we want to be disciplined and have been and opportunistic when it comes to ma and any deal that we would look at would need to make strategic and financial sense and consistent with our guidelines and i think the executive order will mean there will be additional attention for bank ma but we believe ultimately decisions will be driven by whats best for all stakeholders and thats how were thinking about it us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect all right thank you guys very much andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure operator your next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi terry hi andy andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc terry you touched on in your opening comments about loan growth and you mentioned about the ci growth increased slightly driven by assetbacked type of lending but it was partially offset by the continued paydown activity in other ci categories the question is on the pay down activity we know that many of the commercial borrowers have elevated liquidity levels which may be contributing to this but can you maybe further elaborate on what your customers are telling you is it the supply chain problem where they just like your auto dealers for example just dont have the inventory therefore they have this extra cash flow and theyre able to pay down and would this then change as the supply chain issues for all companies not just auto starts to get ironed out in the next to months which could lead to maybe an accelerated commercial loan demand terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i mean i do think that commercial loan demand will start to pick up i think its just its a matter of timing when does that actually occur and i do think that they have to get through that excess liquidity or at least some of it and they also i think that they need to start making those capital expenditures and were starting to see that i mean when we talk across our markets i think that the for example middlemarket customers are certainly much more optimistic today than they were even a quarter or two quarters ago and that usually translates into making longer term sort of business investments and so i think that well continue to kind of see that i do think us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 that were i do think that supply chain is impacting it to some extent but i think that thats more transitory i think that that will dissipate over time in terms of the impact andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp terry i agree and the only other key factor i think is many companies are awash in liquidity they have strong balance sheets theyve been becoming more efficient and their balance sheets are strong which was reflected in our deposits on the right side of the balance sheet so i think thats another factor gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and just as a followup on this commercial customer discussions that youve been having with these customers whats their view about inflation are they concerned that theyre not going to be able to pass on higher prices to their customers or any color that you guys are picking up in your discussions with these customers about the outlook for inflation and what it means to them andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah i think gerard a number of our manufacturing companies in particular are passing on some of the increased supply costs that theyre recognizing and it is a factor in their pricing as well so i do think some of it is being passed on a lot of its being passed on and i think this question around how transitory this is is one that is often debated but i can tell you right now its impactful how long it lasts im not sure gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just as a followup andy you touched about the liquidity helping on the deposit side we also all understand what quantitative easing has done to the deposits of the banking system do you think that when tapering takes place probably end of the year lets say that there may be some pressure on deposit growth for you folks or that you really havent been impacted that materially by the quantitative easing by the fed because thats more wholesaleoriented and maybe ph in part hitting the money centered banks maybe more so than you folks andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so i think we us bank and we the industry have certainly benefited from a deposit growth standpoint because of the fed balance sheet i dont think theres any dispute around that i do think as that starts to diminish youll see some impact on deposits but i also would point out that some deposits have also or some funds have also moved offbalance sheet to money market funds this is again this mix we have and this opportunity to go either onbalance sheet or offbalance sheet so some might migrate more to the onbalance sheet component in that environment gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure operator your next question is from mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi just a followup a bigpicture question andy youve had six years of negative operating leverage and we all know the reasons for that from the regulatory to the investing to the pandemic and everything else and i guess technically yearoveryear still a little negative but quarteroverquarter this is some of the best positive operating leverage youve had in a while and it seems like its not going negative ahead it seems so are you willing to call a turn in that six years of negative operating leverage or is it too early or is that kind of a next year event i know im getting ahead of where you maybe want to go but its been a long wait for the revenues growing faster than expenses it seems like you might be there but im not sure andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah mike so i think like i mentioned before were going to manage expenses flat in this challenging revenue environment and the challenging revenue environments a function of the things weve talked about which is this lowerthannormal loan growth this flat and low yield curve and the function of still returning to normalization on things like travel and entertainment and so forth so flat until we get normal and then positive operating leverage when we start to get to a more normalized revenue environment thats how were managing the company mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp you bet operator your next question is from bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning i just wanted to ask one followup you guys have historically been very deliberate about your use of ma to create value as you look ahead is there an opportunity to think differently for example by taking the strength of your existing franchise to expand into new markets and win customers without having to acquire legacy branch infrastructure or is sort of bank ma likely to look the same as it has traditionally any thoughts around that topic would be helpful andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2021 yeah bill so we talked about the factors theres a few ways that we continue to grow and expand from a consumer and retail and business standpoint one is continued acquisition with our core organic initiatives around digital acquisition and focusing on that which were making great progress on the second is this concept of digitalfirst branchlite expansion like we were doing in charlotte north carolina where we have fewer branches and really leveraging data and digital capabilities the third is partnerships like what weve done with state farm agents who are really working to refer our card and deposit products its just an extension nationwide of our capabilities and the fourth would be more traditional ma and we look at all those opportunities depending upon whats in front of us bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thank you very much for taking my question andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure operator at this time there are no further questions i will now hand the call back for closing remarks jennifer ann thompson executive vice president directorinvestor relations and economic analysis
