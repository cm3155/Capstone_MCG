integration charges related to the planned acquisition of mufg union bank excluding these notable items we reported earnings per share of for the quarter during the third quarter we achieved record net revenue totaling billion third quarter results were highlighted by strong revenue growth wellcontrolled expenses and stable credit quality this quarter we added million to our loan loss reserve reflecting loan growth and our consistent throughthecycle underwriting approach to risk management at september our cet1 capital ratio was our tangible book value per share totaled at september or lower than the prior quarter driven by the impact of rising interest rates on our availableforsale securities slide provides key performance metrics excluding notable items we delivered a return on average assets of and a return on average common equity of our return on tangible common equity was on a core basis slide highlights continued positive trends in digital engagement as consumer and business customers gain a deeper understanding of our digital capabilities and benefit from our digitalplushuman approach slide slows progress across our digital and payments initiatives that are both deepening our core competencies and expanding our competitive advantage which we believe will drive meaningful profit and return differentiation to our company one example of our digital initiatives is our launch of talech register a nextgeneration allinone payments and business analytics platform that is helping to bring greater simplicity convenience and efficiencies to the point of sale for our business banking customers on the right side of the slide you can see the continuing momentum we are gaining in realtime payments transactions yeartodate through september the total number of transactions are times higher than the full year recently we introduced an innovative realtime payment solution to auto dealers where we provide loan funds instantly after a loan contract is finalized this gives our participating dealer clients greater control of their cash flow and helps to improve their daytoday operational efficiency turning to slide our business banking initiative continues to gain traction with steady progress both in growing accounts and expanding wallet share growth in relationships with both banking and payments products has continued to meaningfully outpace growth in total relationships over the past months looking ahead we expect recently launched and innovative offerings in development to help further deepen our existing relationships between business banking and payments customers now let me turn the call over to terry wholl provide more detail on the quarter us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 terrance r dolan chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp thanks andy if you turn to slide ill start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of third quarter earnings trends average loans increased compared with the second quarter driven by growth in commercial loans growth in mortgage loans and growth in credit card balances commercial loan growth reflected increased business activity and higher utilization rates across both large corporate and middlemarket portfolios underlying demand remains healthy as we continue to focus on appropriate return opportunities to prudently deploy our capital in the retail portfolio we saw solid linkedquarter growth and yearoveryear growth in credit card balances reflecting strong spending activity and lower payment rates purchased mortgage market share gains and lower prepayment activity continued to support residential mortgage balance growth turning to slide total average deposits increased slightly compared to the second quarter growth in total interestbearing deposits more than offset the impact of lower total noninterestbearing deposit balances as customers respond to the rising interest rate environment total average deposits increased by compared to a year ago slide shows credit quality trends which continue to be strong across our loan portfolio the ratio of non performing assets to loans and other real estate was at september compared with at june and a year ago our third quarter chargeoff ratio of improved slightly versus the second quarter of and third quarter of levels the allowance for credit losses as of september totaled billion or of periodend loans the million increase in our reserve this quarter was primarily reflective of loan growth and to a lesser extent uncertainties in the economic outlook slide provides an earnings summary in the third quarter we reported per share excluding per share of merger and integration charges related to the planned acquisition of mufg union bank turning to slide net interest income on a fully taxableequivalent basis totaled billion representing an increase compared with the second quarter and a increase from a year ago linked quarter growth was driven by strong earning asset growth and a basis point increase in the net interest margin which benefited from rising interest rates partially offset by deposit pricing and shortterm borrowing costs slide highlights trends in noninterest income noninterest income decreased on a linked quarter basis as declines in mortgage banking and treasury management revenues were partially offset by stronger corporate payments revenue and an increase in other noninterest revenue compared with a year ago noninterest income declined primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue reduced deposit service charges reflecting changes in our policies and lower treasury management fees due to rising rates partially offset by higher payments revenue and trust and investment management fees the decline in mortgage revenue primarily reflected lower refinancing activity in the market which continued to pressure total application volumes and the related gainonsale margins given excess industry capacity in the third quarter total payments revenue increased by compared with the year earlier us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 slide provides linked quarter and yearoveryear revenue growth trends for our three payments businesses because of the cyclical nature of our payments businesses we believe yearoveryear trends are a better indicator of underlying business performance in a normal environment credit and debit card fee revenue decreased on a yearoveryear basis as the impact of higher credit card and debit card volume was more than offset by continued lower prepaid card activity excluding prepaid card activity which was elevated last year in connection with supporting unemployment programs credit and debit card fee revenue would have increased compared with the third quarter of the bottom half of the slide illustrates the yearoveryear growth rates in both merchant processing and corporate payments fee revenue over the last several quarters third quarter merchant processing revenue increased yearoveryear growth was negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates given market volatility in europe and specifically in the uk excluding the fx impact yearoveryear growth in merchant fee revenue was approximately slide provides some additional information on our payment services business on the right side of the slide you will see the continued strong momentum we are seeing in our techled revenue and partnerships within our merchant acquiring business the key to that trajectory is the strong growth we have seen in new techled partnerships through the third quarter new techled partnerships yeartodate were times the number of new partnerships we had acquired in the entire year of and these partnerships are continuing to grow turning to slide noninterest expense increased on a linked quarter basis excluding merger integration costs associated with the pending acquisition of union bank the change in expense was driven by higher compensation professional services and marketing and business development expenses slide highlights our capital position our common equity tier common our common equity tier capital ratio at september was on slide ill provide some forwardlooking guidance for us bank on a standalone basis again this guidance does not include any potential impact of union bank let me start with full year guidance which is consistent with our previous expectations we continue to expect total net revenue to increase to in compared to we expect midteen growth in taxable equivalent net interest income which is slightly improved from our previous outlook of low to midteens growth we continue to expect a decline in fee revenue for the full year primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on mortgage revenue due to lower refinancings in the market lower deposit service charges due to pricing changes and a decline in other noninterest income we continue to expect positive operating leverage of at least basis points in excluding the impact of merger and integrationrelated costs associated with the union bank acquisition for the full year of we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately ill now provide guidance for the fourth quarter we expect both total revenue and total core expenses excluding merger and integration costs to increase by approximately on a linked quarter basis net interest income will continue to be supported by earning asset growth and higher rates however our fee revenue will be lower reflecting typical seasonality in some of our feebased businesses us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 credit quality remains strong over the next few quarters we expect the net chargeoff ratio to remain lower than historical levels but to normalize over time changes in the allowance for credit losses near term will primarily reflect loan growth and changes in the economic outlook if you turn to slide ill provide an update on our previously announced pending acquisition of union bank in september of we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the core regional banking franchise of mufg union bank we continue to make significant progress in planning for the closing of the deal in the fourth quarter of while we await regulatory approval as you know regulatory approvals are not within the companys control and may impact the timing of the closing of the deal as a reminder we expect to close on the deal approximately days after being granted us regulatory approval as previously discussed we are targeting a conversion date in the first half of the financial merits of the deal remain intact our eps accretion estimates are unchanged and we continue to estimate the acquisition will generate an internal rate of return of approximately which is well above our cost of capital the companys target cet1 capital ratio is based on interest rates as of october our cet1 capital ratio at close would approximate we expect the cet ratio to increase towards as the purchase accounting valuation adjustments accrete into capital through earnings ill hand it back to andy for closing remarks andrew j cecere chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks terry the investments we have made and continue to make across our business lines are paying off in terms of improved customer experience new customer acquisition and deeper relationships expense management is a priority and we continue to target positive operating leverage in and beyond we look forward to closing on the union bank acquisition pending regulatory approval this is a unique opportunity at scale in one of our core markets and we remain confident in the strategic and financial merits of the deal the current credit environment is benign in fact our net chargeoff ratio in the third quarter remained near historic lows and we are not seeing any meaningful earlystage metrics that causes concern that being said we recognize the pressure points are building in several areas of the economy that could lead to stress in the future borrowing costs are increasing inflation is high saving rates are starting to decline and the stock market is well off its highs so while the backdrop is favorable today it would not be surprising to us to see an economic slowdown develop at some point driven by lower confidence levels which may lead to reduced spending and business investment there are a number of scenarios that may play out over the next several quarters we are preparing for a range of possible outcomes by prudently managing credit liquidity and capital so that we continue to grow within our throughthecycle risk management framework and deliver industryleading returns in summary our investments are paying off we remain diligent stewards of capital our balance sheet is strong and our focus is firmly fixed on managing the company for the long term us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 ill close by saying thank you to our employees your hard work and focus in doing the right thing for our customers and communities every day is recognized and appreciated well now open it up to qa question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions john pancari with evercore is online for a question go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp morning john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc on your commentary around the cet1 falling to at close but need to get back up to the before you resume buybacks can you give us a little more color on that in terms of timing around when you think you can reach that with the pa accretion and how we should think about the magnitude of buybacks at that time thanks terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah thanks john so again our expectations at close of but we do expect that that will get to roughly within about four quarters and a big part of that will be obviously earnings growth driven by the accretion of the marktomarket that will end up impacting earnings during that particular timeframe so our expectation and what we have been signaling in the past is that we would start our share buyback program once we get to that so about four quarters john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay all right thank you thats helpful and then just separately can you just give us more color on the payments trends that youre seeing both in merchant processing and corporate payments businesses and maybe if you could just talk about the potential moderation in activity there that you could see as the economy reacts to the fed action andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah john this is andy and its interesting from a credit card spend standpoint while the categories of spend as weve talked about before have shifted a bit the level of spend is still fairly strong about on a yearover year basis and about above precovid levels we did get impacted as terry noted in his prepared us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 comments by the fx rate of the pound in our merchant processing and excluding that our revenues would have been up just over we can as well sort of a related topic we see for two years we have seen our consumer deposit levels by account increase and as we mentioned last quarter its been flat its been flat for the second quarter and its relatively flat not down modestly here in the third quarter so we would expect some moderation of spend but were not seeing it yet john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay thanks for taking my question andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thank you operator matt oconnor with deutsche bank is online with a question terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hey matt how are you this morning nathan stein q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hello this is nathan stein on behalf of matt oconnor i just want to followup quickly on the payments outlook i think previously youve talked about higherthannormal yearoveryear growth in the second half of this year before moderating to high single digits next year just to followup on what you were just talking about does that guidance still make sense in this environment terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i mean our expectation is with respect to our payments revenues of high single digits and we think that based upon what we are seeing with respect to consumer spend at this particular point in time that that is still very realistic as andy said relative to precovid volumes are continuing to be very strong and while there is a bit of a shift with respect to where that spend is occurring its still continuing the other thing is that where if and when transaction levels start to tail off i think the impact of inflation will have an offsetting effect so we still feel pretty confident about it nathan stein q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thank you so much thats helpful and then one quick followup question can you just touch on the plan to manage the balance sheet post the deal closing whenever that is i think total assets were just above billion at the end of this quarter and with union bank it will push you above the billion threshold so how are you thinking about that going forward us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah our expectation is that well continue to manage the balance sheet in a very prudent way looking for and supporting relationships that are higherprofitable sort of relationships our expectation is that because i think where youre heading is really related to cat ii our expectation is at the earliest that we would get into that category is the end of but our ability to manage riskweighted assets and balance sheet levels may extend that to some extent nathan stein q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you operator mike mayo with wells fargo is online with a question terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i think at a recent conference you said that you will not achieve as much synergies from union bank next year as you originally thought but no change in eps guidance did i hear that correctly terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah that is correct and if you think about the dynamics mike while the timing has changed and the synergies associated with the million of synergies that we expect to achieve when fully implemented the timing will be offset to some extent by the accretion of the marktomarket will be a little bit stronger so we still feel pretty confident with respect to the accretion levels that we have guided in the past mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc right so instead of you said to terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah to mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc to and epsaccretive so if youre getting less merger synergies next year than you originally thought and you have the same eps guidance are you de facto increasing the end result of expected accretion from union bank us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i dont think that were moving off of our estimates that we have provided in the past at this particular point in time i think we need to get beyond the closing the approval and then the closing before we i think would significantly change any estimates at this point mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and any early guidance for next year some other banks are giving some general kind of guidepost for in terms of operating leverage and your guidance is saying this would be some of the best operating leverage in over five years i guess and just trying to figure out how confident you are in that continuing i know you invested for a number of years in the tech infrastructure and now you hope to capitalize on that at a time when business is coming back but how much followthrough should investors expect for this positive operating leverage andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah mike were focused on positive operating leverage on a core basis and well continue to achieve that next year has a fairly large moving part with union bank coming on so that is going to be our top priority is to make sure we successfully convert and integrate that in this company which will allow for more positive operating leverage but that we havent provided any guidance update on that yet mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks mike operator erika najarian from ubs is online with the question terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning erika andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 hi good morning terry im going to have to ask you about the pro forma cet1 that you mentioned youre estimating at close i think i didnt realize that there has been a significant conversation in the market that perhaps has contributed to the threemonth underperformance with concern about the widening of the interest rate marks so i think that at announcement you were looking at a basis point loan markup on ubs loan portfolio that youre bringing over given that a significant portion of that portfolio is resi i think there was a lot of math being done in the buy side that was lets say basis points lower than what you were giving us so i guess my question here is how is the street getting the math wrong or are there protections that are built into the deal or are there hedges on ubs balance sheet that seems to be protecting your pro forma cet1 from a greater day one mark relative to how interest rates have moved since announcement terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i think it could be a combination of different things i mean for example there is an expectation that they will deliver a certain level of tangible book value and to the extent that their availableforsale portfolio is impacted prior to the acquisition there is kind of a makewhole provision within the agreement related to the availableforsale securities so that is part of it i think some of it could be just what the assumptions are related to the duration of the resi portfolio and then again well end up looking at and managing in this rate environment the balance sheet as prudently as we can to ensure that we are allocating capital to the appropriate businesses during this timeframe so its a combination of a different a variety of different things erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it so i guess thats the question as a followup question that billion that they have to deliver theres a makewhole provision on the afs portfolio but not on the loan portfolio im presuming is what youre saying terry terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp that is true yeah erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it is there and im presuming also theres a potential cdi offset at close that could help offset but obviously that would be a higher amortization cost in day two and after terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yes i mean its a combination of a whole variety of things i mean its not only the interest rate marks but its what does the loan portfolio look like in terms of overall quality relative to kind of what our original estimates were we think that that is slightly better than cdi i mean you have to look at all of the different moving parts in terms of coming up with what we think the final impact of the marktomarket is going to be us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you so much operator bill carcache with wolfe research is online with the question bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning andy and terry how are you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc hi so we saw a nice remixing out of availableforsale and heldtomaturity wanted to followup on that and more specifically whether theres room for you to take the mix of availableforsale higher itd be helpful if you could just give some color on what guides your decision on how high the htm mix could go terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah great question bill so today were currently at about heldtomaturity versus availableforsale and we moved some securities in early july when rates dipped that allowed us to be able to kind of increase that percentage the other thing that we take into consideration is the fact that with respect to the afs portfolio theres also floating rate securities that have very little impact with respect to aoci so when you end up combining that together its about that is protected substantially protected from movements in interest rates so think about it almost as a sort of split in terms of the sensitivity to interest rates and is there opportunity i mean well continue to look at whether that makes sense relative to our balance sheet positioning but at least right now we feel pretty comfortable with that mix it gives us the aoci protection as well as some flexibility with respect to managing the balance sheet bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats helpful terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp and then the other thing you have to kind of think about is that we have union bank that hopefully well be closing on here in the fourth quarter and that ends up influencing decisions that we make with respect to the positioning of the balance sheet and excuse me of the securities portfolio and then also with respect to deposits were going to have a significant amount of deposits coming on and thats going to help us as well us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful and separately i wanted to followup on funding and more specifically the decrease in noninterest bearing deposits is it reasonable to expect that your mix of noninterestbearing deposits is going to gradually revert to precovid levels as the fed proceeds with qt maybe if you could address that if you have any view sort of at the industry level and then specifically for usb terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yes well i certainly think that qt is going to put pressure on deposits overall and as interest rates rise youll continue to see a shift out of noninterestbearing toward interestbearing whether i mean i think that the assumption with respect to precovid may make sense depending upon how much they bring their balance sheet down et cetera how much liquidity they leave in the system with respect to us it probably if i had to make estimates i would say that it probably stays a little bit better than where it was prepandemic in part because weve grown our consumer portfolio which tends to offset that and then weve also worked hard to focus within our corporate trust business on retaining those deposits that are more operational in nature and because theyre more operational in nature they tend to be more interest noninterest bearing as opposed to interestbearing bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc that makes sense and sticking with that theme in terms of the mix of debt relative to your overall funding thats still well below fourth quarter levels can you speak to the likelihood that we should expect that to gradually remix back to precovid levels terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah again i think the broad assumption would be fair but again keep in mind that union bank is going to be coming on and they have a significant they actually have a higher percentage within their deposit base thats consumerbased and so i think you have to kind of look at the entire mix and i think were going to be us bank i think specifically is probably going to be in a better position than we were prepandemic bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats great finally if i could squeeze in one last one could you speak to your ability to bring offbalancesheet money market funds back on balance sheet maybe some of the dynamics surrounding that terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah great question so currently we have about roughly billion in money market funds and that is a business thats very tied to our institutional investor services business based upon what we need to do from a funding perspective we have the ability from a pricing point of view to bring that back on balance sheet or off balance sheet but its pricing decisions that then influence customer behavior and it is a great source for us from a funding standpoint as there is more pressure on deposits going forward us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc great thank you for taking my questions operator gerard cassidy with rbc is online with a question terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hey good morning gerard andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi terry hi andy terry i think in your comments you talked about the residential mortgage business and the gainonsale margins were lower and i think you referenced theres still excess capacity in that line of business can you share with us your outlook youve seen some of that capacity coming out in the fourth quarter if rates remain elevated for the refi activity of course being negatively affected by elevated longterm rates terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah we certainly are seeing capacity come down in the industry i think youve seen various announcements of bank and nonbank mortgage operations kind of pulling back or reducing capacity i think it probably still needs to reset to some extent whats happening with rising rates and the impact that it might have on both refinancing as well as home sales but we do see it coming down our expectation is that gainonsale margins stabilize and probably for us improve a bit in the third quarter our gainonsale was down maybe a little bit more than what we had anticipated but about half of that is really driven by the mix between correspondent and retail and the other half of it is really more revenue recognition some timing issues and some secondary kind of market valuation issues which we think will reverse a bit gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good i saw when we looked at your average loan portfolio obviously you had some very nice growth in ci very strong growth yearoveryear were hearing some market chatter and i dont know if its just the equity reits are squawking but apparently the commercial real estate mortgage business might be a little more less liquid today any color that you guys can offer on what youre seeing in commercial mortgage real estate is it an area that youre pulling back some i know you had growth but maybe some color and insights on what youre hearing and seeing and what your views are for that business us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah certainly with respect to commercial real estate its an important business for us and one that well continue to be very focused on i think part of it is just dynamics in the marketplace if you end up looking at the large corporate reits sort of financing we continue to lend in that particular space we actually probably saw some growth in the third quarter but we do know homebuilders are starting to pull back and even making decisions to maybe pull out of potential projects that they were planning on doing and then in the middlemarket space in terms of commercial real estate its actually still from a pricing standpoint pretty competitive and people extending terms associated with that and thats the space that were not comfortable with at this particular point in the cycle so were seeing a little bit of pressure maybe in the middlemarket space but were fine with that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp thanks gerard operator ken usdin with jefferies is online with a question terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hey good morning terry thanks i wanted to just ask a little bit more on the whole outlook for deposits i know you talked about the mix just wondering what you guys are seeing given the fact that you have a little bit of a different mix versus most of the peers in terms of any updates on what youre thinking about where betas eventually go to just given that were in a completely different rate regime than we might have all thought here six months ago terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah well maybe ill kind of start just by reiterating if we end up looking at the mix of our deposit base it has changed a little bit relative to maybe what we were three four years ago et cetera certainly when we went through the last rate rising cycle a little stronger consumer a little more focus around operational deposits within our trust business et cetera trust is also on a relative basis represents only about of our deposit base today and then again think about union bank coming on and some of the dynamics that that will bring but coming back to deposit betas then maybe with that context were actually performing probably better than what we might us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 have expected i think deposit betas were about in the second quarter about coming up from about we would expect that to be maybe in the high as we get into the fourth quarter but certainly as rates continue to rise and if the fed continues to be very aggressive its going to migrate to higher percentages our throughthecycle estimate right now is still kind of mid but we kind of think about the entire rate cycle that were going through ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay and then as a followup to that so as that plays forward youre still expecting good nii growth into the fourth quarter can nii i know youre not giving guidance but just can you help us understand like what is the gives and takes to make can you still grow nii post the fourth quarter sequentially or is it just a reality check about some of these mix and beta functions that make that tougher terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah well i think that we can continue to grow nii as we get beyond the fourth quarter what i would say though is that probably the pace of growth changes in the industry and that will be a function of it will be a function of the deposit betas changing and the loan growth that certainly the industry has been experiencing i think is very strong i dont know whether it will keep that particular base as we kind of continue to move forward ken usdin q analyst jefferies company all right understood thank you terry operator betsy graseck with morgan stanley is online with a question betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hey betsy andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc on your own securities indiscernible it would be helpful maybe you could give us a sense as to how we should be thinking about the pull to par in the afs book like if i know its a big if but if rates dont change from here how many quarters or years is it that we should be baking into our models us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah well i think what we have said is that the duration of the portfolio is a little over five years so if you think about that i think that probably gives you some guide with respect to how aoci kind of comes into the capital equation betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so it should its like a longer than fiveyear period terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah a little bit longer but not much betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and is there anything youre thinking about with regard to restructuring the books once union bank comes on terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah its again well take a look at all of the balance sheet and kind of see where it makes sense we do expect that we might remix the securities portfolio when it comes on we may end up increasing htm as a result of what we bring over et cetera so it is definitely something we will take a look at betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then just separately on the consumer lens that you have in the payment side could you just give us a sense as to what you saw in i know tends to be a relatively strong quarter for you any changes in behavior any insights as to how you think will end up shaping up terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp so betsy the consumer spend levels overall continue to be strong they were up on credit card spend about on a yearoveryear basis about above precovid levels the mix of categories has changed a bit consistent with what weve talked about before a little bit away from hard goods to more services and a little bit away from nondiscretionary to nondiscretionary form discretionary so that shift in spend that we have been discussing continues but the overall levels are also still very strong betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and the savings levels of the consumers are hanging in there indiscernible us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yes betsy so i mentioned that we saw increases across all stratas of balances for about two years but the last two quarters have been stable across all the categories so not growing anymore but not shrinking dramatically as well betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thanks so much terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp you bet terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hey ken i just want to clarify something with respect to deposit betas just to make sure that ive got the percentages right the deposit betas in the second quarter were about deposit betas in the third quarter were just shy of and we would expect that increase to continue as rates rise and to accelerate a bit and again probably in the high when we get into the fourth quarter operator we have no further questions
