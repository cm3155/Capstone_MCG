item risk factors except for the new and updated risk factors related to the svbb acquisition set forth below there have been no material changes in the risk factors during from those reported in our a voluntary petition under chapter in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york on march if we are unable to effectively and efficiently replace these functions previously provided or facilitated by svb financial group and certain of its subsidiaries we could face additional disruptions in our operations loss of existing customers loss of key information expertise or knowhow and unanticipated additional recruitment and third party vendor costs any inability to realize the full extent or any of the anticipated benefits of the svbb acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations and strengthen our reputation among legacy svb clients following the svbb acquisition following the consummation of the svbb acquisition the size and geographic and operational scope of our business has increased significantly the svbb acquisition substantially increased our asset size from total consolidated assets of approximately billion at december to approximately billion at march increased the breadth and complexity of our business with the addition of new business lines in which we have not previously engaged and expanded our geographic scope to new geographic areas further legacy svbs client were concentrated within the certain industries including technology life science and healthcare private equity and venture capital and premium wine our future success depends in part upon the ability to manage this expanded business while strengthening our reputation among the venture capital and private equity communities and other participants in the industries that legacy svb served which will pose substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new and expanded operations and associated increased costs and complexity we may be unsuccessful in this regard or fail to realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the svbb acquisition credit risks our concentration of loans and leases in certain industries increases the risk for losses and could impair our earnings if these industries experience economic difficulties prior to the svbb acquisition we had a substantial concentration of loans and leases in the medical and dental industries as well as the rail business a significant portion of the loans acquired in the svbb acquisition were concentrated in the technology life science and healthcare sectors as well as loans to former global private equity and venture capital clients of legacy svb prior to the svbb acquisition we did not have significant exposure to these industries although we believe our current loan portfolio is welldiversified borrowers in certain industries may have a heightened vulnerability to negative economic conditions for example statutory or regulatory changes relevant to the medical and dental industries or economic conditions in the market generally could negatively impact these borrowers businesses and their ability to repay their loans with us additionally smaller practices such as those in the dental industry generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and generally have a heightened vulnerability to negative economic conditions repayment of loans in the portfolios for earlystage and midstage privately held companies including those acquired in the svbb acquisition may depend upon receipt by those borrowers of additional financing from venture capitalists or others or in some cases a successful sale to a third party public offering or other form of liquidity event in addition decreases in the amount of equity capital available to earlystage and midstage companies including through a decrease in merger and acquisition activity could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay our loans in these industries if such events occur our levels of nonperforming assets and charge offs may increase and we may be required to increase our acl through additional provisions on our income statement which would reduce reported net income and could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects due to our substantial concentration in our rail business if there is a significant downturn in shipping by railcar it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition volatility in the price of and demand for oil and gas may have negative effects on not only our loan exposures in the exploration and production section but may also lead to a decreased demand for our railcars market risks recent bank failures have created significant market volatility regulatory uncertainty and decreased confidence in the us banking system the recent failures of several highprofile banking institutions have caused significant market volatility regulatory uncertainty and decreased confidence in the us banking system these recent bank failures occurred during a period of rapidly rising interest rates which among other things has resulted in unrealized losses in longer duration securities and more competition for bank deposits and may increase the risk of a potential economic recession in the united states given the current environment we may experience more deposit volatility as customers react to adverse events or market speculation involving financial institutions in response to the bank failures the united states government may adopt a variety of measures and new regulations designed to strengthen capital levels liquidity standards and risk management practices and otherwise restore confidence in financial institutions any reforms if adopted could have a significant impact on banks and bhcs including us we may also be subject to any special assessment that the fdic adopts to recover the loss to the deposit insurance fund and such assessment if significant could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects liquidity risks if our current level of balance sheet liquidity were to experience pressure it could affect our ability to pay deposits and fund our operations our deposit base represents our primary source of core funding and balance sheet liquidity we typically have the ability to stimulate core deposit growth through reasonable and effective pricing strategies however in circumstances where our ability to generate needed liquidity is impaired we need access to noncore funding such as borrowings from the fhlb and the federal reserve federal funds purchased lines and brokered deposits in connection with the svbb acquisition we also entered into binding terms and conditions pursuant to which the fdic is providing a fiveyear up to billion line of credit during the twoyear period following the svbb acquisition date we may draw on the fdic credit facility to support liquidity including for deposit withdrawal or runoff and to fund the unfunded commercial lending commitments acquired in connection with the svbb acquisition while we maintain access to these noncore funding sources including the fdic credit facility some sources are dependent on the availability of collateral as well as the counterpartys willingness and ability to lend failure to access sources of liquidity may affect our ability to pay deposits and fund our operations capital adequacy risks increases to our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and to meet our obligations in connection with the svbb acquisition as initial payment under the purchase agreement fcb issued a fiveyear purchase money note of approximately billion payable to the fdic our existing debt together with any future incurrence of additional indebtedness and preferred stock including under the fdic credit facility could have consequences that are materially adverse to our business financial condition or results of operations for example it could i limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes ii restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make nonstrategic divestitures iii restrict us from paying dividends to our stockholders iv increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions or v require a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and dividends on the preferred stock thereby reducing our ability to use cash flows to fund our operations capital expenditures and future business opportunities refer to the borrowings sections of item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this quarterly report on form 10q for additional information regarding our borrowings financial reporting risks the svbb acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and is based upon a preliminary valuation that involves significant estimates that are subject to change as required by us gaap the svbb acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and is based upon a preliminary valuation that involves significant estimates that are subject to change the opening balances of acquired assets and assumed liabilities in connection with the svbb acquisition have not been audited and have been recorded at estimated fair value based on information currently available to the company in developing these fair value estimates management was required to make significant estimates involving among other things the assigned risk ratings to loans based on credit quality appraisals and estimated collateral values estimated expected cash flows and appropriate liquidity and coupon discounts the loans purchased in connection with the svbb acquisition have credit profiles that differ from most banking companies for example many of the legacy svb loans acquired were made to earlystage privately held companies with modest or negative cash flows andor no established record of profitable operations in addition a significant portion of the loans were comprised of larger loans equal to or greater than million and collateral for many of the legacy svb loans in the technology life science and healthcare industries include intellectual property and other intangible assets which are difficult to value and not readily salable in the case of default furthermore the receivables from the fdic for the commercial shared loss agreement involve significant estimates that involve uncertainty in addition the core deposit intangibles was valued using the aftertax cost savings method under the income approach this method estimates the fair value by discounting to present value the favorable funding spread attributable to the core deposit balances over their estimated average remaining life the valuation considered a dynamic approach to interest rates and alternative cost of funds the favorable funding spread is calculated as the difference in the alternative cost of funds and the net deposit cost the estimates used in creating the preliminary fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed may change as additional information becomes available which could lead to changes in the companys fair value estimates as such we may experience more adverse outcomes than originally estimated and the acl may need to be revised
