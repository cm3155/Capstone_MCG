item risk factors risk factor summary we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operations and cash flows as a financial services organization certain elements of risk are inherent in our transactions and operations and are present in the business decisions we make we encounter risks as part of the normal course of our business and our success is dependent on our ability to identify understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities we categorize risks into the following areas and the principal risks and uncertainties that management believes make an investment in us speculative or risky are summarized within their respective areas strategic risks the risks to our earnings or capital arising from our business decisions or improper implementation of those decisions we may be adversely affected by risks associated with completed pending or any potential future acquisitions we encounter significant competition that may reduce our market share and profitability operational risks the risks of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes staffing and systems or from external events we face significant operational risks in our businesses and may fail to maintain appropriate operational infrastructure and oversight a cyberattack information or security breach or a technology outage of ours or of a thirdparty could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business manage our exposure to risk result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential customer or employee data or proprietary information and increase our costs to maintain and update our operational and security systems and infrastructure this could adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition as well as cause us legal or reputational harm credit risks the risks that a borrower obligor or counterparty will fail to perform on an obligation or that our risk management processes will fail or be insufficient if we fail to effectively manage credit risk our business and financial condition will suffer our allowance for credit losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our credit portfolios market risks the risks to our financial condition resulting from adverse movements in domestic and international macroeconomic and political conditions as well as economic output levels interest and inflation rates employment levels prices of commodities consumer confidence levels and changes in consumer spending international trade policy and fiscal and monetary policy unfavorable economic or political conditions as considered through a range of metrics have and could continue to adversely affect our business failure to effectively manage our interest rate risk could adversely affect us liquidity risks the risks that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due because of an inability to i liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding or ii unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions or that we will not meet the liquidity management requirements applicable to us as a category iv banking organization subject to the applicable transition periods if our current level of balance sheet liquidity were to experience pressure it could affect our ability to pay deposits and fund our operations we are subject to enhanced liquidity risk management requirements as a category iv banking organization subject to the applicable transition periods including reporting liquidity stress testing and liquidity buffer as well as resolution planning at the bank level and failure to meet these requirements could result in regulatory and compliance risks and possible restrictions on our activities capital adequacy risks the risks that our capital levels become inadequate to preserve our safety and soundness support our ongoing business operations and strategies and provide us with support against unexpected or sudden changes in the businesseconomic environment or that we will not meet the capital adequacy requirements applicable to us as a category iv banking organization subject to the applicable transition periods our ability to grow is contingent upon access to capital which may not be readily available to us we and fcb are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and if we fail to meet these guidelines our financial condition and ability to make capital distributions would be adversely affected compliance risks the risks of loss or reputational harm to us resulting from regulatory sanctions fines penalties or losses due to our failure to comply with laws rules regulations or other supervisory requirements applicable to us we operate in a highly regulated industry and the laws and regulations that govern our operations taxes corporate governance executive compensation and financial accounting and reporting including changes in them or our failure to comply with them may adversely affect us information security and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus asset risks the risks that the value of our longlived assets will be lower than expected resulting in reduced income over the remaining life of the asset or a lower sale value we may not be able to realize our entire investment in the equipment that we lease to our customers financial reporting risks the risks that our financial information is reported incorrectly or incompletely including through the improper application of accounting standards or other errors or omissions accounting standards may change and increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely affect our results our accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain and such estimates may be materially different from actual results the risks and uncertainties that management believes are material to an investment in us are described below additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to management or that management does not currently deem material could also have a material adverse impact on our financial condition the results of our operations or our business if such risks and uncertainties were to materialize or the likelihoods of the risks were to increase we could be adversely affected and the market price of our securities could significantly decline strategic risks we may be adversely affected by risks associated with completed pending or any potential future acquisitions we plan to continue to grow our business organically however we have pursued and expect to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe support our business strategies and may enhance our profitability we must generally satisfy a number of material conditions prior to consummating any acquisition including in many cases federal and state regulatory approval or requirements and we may be subject to potentially increased regulatory requirements in the future our regulators will consider among other things our capital liquidity profitability regulatory compliance adequacy of risk management and levels of goodwill when considering acquisition and expansion proposals the federal reserve fdic and occ are currently reevaluating the framework for review of bank mergers and acquisitions on january the occ announced a proposed rule to eliminate expedited processing and use of streamlined application forms with respect to transactions subject to its review and approval under the bma additionally the occs proposal highlights additional scrutiny of transactions generally the federal reserve and fdic have not proposed a similar rulemaking but the agencies may be impacted or influenced by the actions of the occ we may fail to complete strategic and competitively significant business opportunities as a result of our inability to obtain required regulatory approvals in a timely manner or at all or the approval for such opportunity could include conditions imposing additional costs or limitations that reduce the anticipated related benefits our recent acquisitions include the svbb acquisition in march and the cit merger in january we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our previous acquisitions and fully integrating our prior acquisitions may be more difficult costly or timeconsuming than expected acquisitions of financial institutions assets of financial institutions or other operating entities involve operational risks and uncertainties in addition acquired companies or assets may have unknown or contingent liabilities exposure to unexpected asset quality problems that require write downs or writeoffs additional regulatory requirements or difficulty retaining key employees and customers in the past we have acquired and may in the future continue to acquire the assets and assume certain liabilities of failed banks in fdicassisted transactions fdicassisted transactions such as the svbb acquisition present unique risks because of the limited due diligence expedited timelines and minimal negotiation of terms to mitigate certain of those risks including credit risks of acquired loans fdicassisted transactions typically provide for fdic assistance including potential losssharing for example in connection with the svbb acquisition fcb entered into a commercial shared loss agreement with the fdic pursuant to which the fdic is obligated to reimburse fcb for i of losses on the first billion of covered loans and ii of losses in excess of billion on covered loans in addition fcb agreed to reimburse the fdic for of recoveries related to covered loans in the svbb acquisition although loss sharing agreements reduce the credit risks of and capital required for fdicassisted transactions these transactions often require additional resources and time to service acquired problem loans costs related to integration of personnel and operating systems and the establishment of processes and internal controls to service acquired assets in accordance with applicable fdic standards if the covered loans are not managed in accordance with the commercial shared loss agreement the fdic has the right to refuse or delay payment for loan losses furthermore reimbursable losses are based on the book value of the relevant loans as determined by the fdic as of the effective date of the transaction therefore the amount that we realize on the loans acquired in the svbb acquisition could differ materially from the carrying value that will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements based upon the timing and amount of collections on the covered loans in future periods any losses we experience on the assets acquired in the svbb acquisition that are not covered under the commercial shared loss agreement could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects following the consummation of the svbb acquisition the size and geographic and operational scope of our business has increased significantly the svbb acquisition was a substantial reason for our increased asset size from total consolidated assets of billion at december to billion at december the svbb acquisition like the cit merger increased the breadth and complexity of our business with the addition of new business lines in which we have not previously engaged and expanded our geographic scope to new areas further legacy silicon valley bank loans were concentrated within certain industries including technology life science and healthcare and with private equity and venture capital clients our future success depends in part upon the ability to manage this expanded business while strengthening our reputation among the venture capital and private equity communities and other participants in the industries that legacy silicon valley bank served which will pose substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new and expanded operations and associated increased costs and complexity due to these and other issues relating to acquisitions we may not be able to realize projected cost savings synergies or other benefits associated with any prior or future acquisition failure to efficiently integrate any acquired entities or assets into our existing operations could significantly increase our operating costs and consequently have material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations we encounter significant competition that may reduce our market share and profitability our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully we operate in a highly competitive industry and we expect competition to intensify we compete with other banks and specialized financial services providers in our market areas our primary competitors include local regional and national banks credit unions commercial finance companies leasing companies various wealth management providers independent and captive insurance agencies mortgage companies and other nonbank providers of financial services some of our larger competitors including certain banks with a significant presence in our market areas have the capacity to offer products and services we do not offer which may enable them to be more aggressive than us in competing for loans and deposits some of our nonbank competitors operate in less stringent regulatory environments and certain competitors are not subject to federal or state income taxes the fierce competitive pressures that we face adversely affect pricing for many of our products and services additionally technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods without involving banks for example consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts mutual funds or virtual accounts consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks transactions utilizing digital assets including cryptocurrencies stablecoins and other similar assets have increased substantially certain characteristics of digital asset transactions such as the speed with which such transactions can be conducted the ability to transact without the involvement of regulated intermediaries the ability to engage in transactions across multiple jurisdictions and the anonymous nature of the transactions are appealing to certain consumers accordingly digital asset service providerswhich at present are not subject to as extensive regulation as banking organizations and other financial institutionshave become active competitors for our customers banking business and may have greater flexibility in competing for business the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries known as disintermediation could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits further an initiative by the cfpb as prompted by the biden administration to promote open and decentralized banking through the proposal of a personal financial data rights rule designed to facilitate the transfer of customer information at the direction of the customer to other financial institutions could lead to greater competition for products and services among banks and nonbanks alike if a final rule is adopted the timing of and prospects for any such action are uncertain at this time the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may prevent a change in management or a takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider to be in their best interests we are a bhc incorporated in the state of delaware certain antitakeover provisions under delaware law and certain provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation our certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws our bylaws could delay or prevent the removal of our directors and other management the provisions could also delay or make more difficult a tender offer merger or proxy contest a stockholder might consider to be in their best interests for example our certificate of incorporation and bylaws allow the board to issue and set the terms of preferred shares without further stockholder approval limit who can call a special meeting of stockholders establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board and proposals of other business to be considered at annual meetings of stockholders and authorize the issuance of two classes of common stock one of which class b common stock par value per share class b common stock is entitled to cast votes per share as of december approximately of the outstanding shares of class b common stock were owned and entitled to be voted by our directors and executive officers and certain of their affiliates these provisions as well as provisions of the bhca and other relevant statutes and regulations that require advance notice and applications for regulatory approval of changes in control of banks and bhcs may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price adversely affecting the price that could be received by our stockholders for our common stock additionally the fact that the holding family and entities related to various family members hold or control shares representing approximately of the voting power of our common stock may discourage potential takeover attempts and bids for our common stock at a premium over market price our bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders this could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees or agents our bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us ii any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers other employees or stockholder to us or our stockholders iii any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the general corporation law of the state of delaware or as to which the general corporation law of the state of delaware confers jurisdiction on the court of chancery of the state of delaware or iv any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine these choice of forum provisions do not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for any actions brought under the securities act of as amended or the securities exchange act of as amended the exchange act accordingly our choice of forum provisions will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws rules and regulations these choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees or agents which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors officers and other employees or agents if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions which could harm our business results of operations and financial condition even if we are successful in defending against these claims litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees we rely on dividends from fcb for paying dividends on our common and preferred stock and servicing our debt obligations and fcbs ability to pay us dividends is restricted as an fhc we are a separate legal entity from fcb we derive most of our revenue and cash flow from dividends paid by fcb these dividends are the primary source from which we pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and interest and principal on our debt obligations state and federal laws impose restrictions on the dividends that fcb may pay to us in general we are required to submit an annual capital plan to the frb that includes any planned dividends redemptions or stock repurchases over a set planning horizon the frb could prohibit or limit our payment of dividends redemptions or stock repurchases if it determines that payment of the dividend or such redemption or stock repurchase would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in the event fcb is unable to pay dividends to us for an extended period of time we may not be able to service our debt obligations or pay dividends on our common or preferred stock and the inability to receive dividends from fcb could consequently have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations our financial performance depends upon our ability to attract and retain customers for our products and services which may be adversely impacted by weakened consumer or business confidence and by any inability on our part to predict and satisfy customers needs and demands our financial performance is subject to risks associated with the loss of customer confidence and demand a fragile weakening or changing economy or ambiguity surrounding the economic future may lessen the demand for our products and services our performance may also be negatively impacted if we fail to attract and retain customers because we are not able to successfully anticipate develop and market products and services that satisfy market demands such events could impact our performance through fewer loans reduced fee income and fewer deposits each of which could result in reduced net income new technologies and our ability to efficiently and effectively implement market and deliver new products and services to our customers present competitive risks the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introduction of new technologydriven products and services the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs the rapid growth of new digital technologies related to the digitization of banking services and capabilities including through internet services smart phones and other mobile devices requires us to continuously evaluate our product and service offerings to ensure they remain competitive these trends were accelerated by the covid19 pandemic increasing demand for mobile banking solutions our success depends in part on our ability to adapt and deliver our products and services in a manner responsive to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences new technologies by banks and nonbank service providers may create risks if our products and services are no longer competitive with thencurrent standards and could negatively affect our ability to attract or maintain a loyal customer base in addition our utilization of new technologies may also create risks that our customers may not be ready for or may not adopt such technologies we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services that allow us to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers these risks may affect our ability to grow and could reduce our revenue streams from certain products and services while increasing expenses associated with developing more competitive solutions which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we are subject to reputational risks that could harm our business and prospects if we were subject to reputational harm it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations maintaining our reputation is important to our business and our brand we are subject to reputational risks that could harm our business and prospects and arise from numerous sources including those discussed further in this annual report on s including certain climaterelated metrics and greenhouse gas emissions data information about climaterelated targets and goals transition plans if any and extensive attestation requirements federal banking agencies have also issued principles related to climate risk management see item businessregulatory considerationsother regulations applicable to the parent company and fcbclimaterelated regulation and risk management for additional information further we may be exposed to negative publicity based on the identity and activities of those to whom we lend and with which we otherwise do business and the publics view of the approach and performance of our customers and business partners with respect to esg matters moreover management time and attention to esg matters may be required to increase to ensure we are compliant with the regulations and expectations our failure to comply with any applicable rules or regulations with respect to esg practices could lead to penalties and adversely impact our access to capital and employee retention and could also impact third parties on which we rely which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations asset risks we may not be able to realize our entire investment in the equipment that we lease to our customers our portfolio includes leased equipment including but not limited to railcars and locomotives technology and office equipment and medical equipment the realization of equipment values residual values during the life and at the end of the term of a lease is an important element in the profitability of our leasing business at the inception of each lease we record a residual value for the leased equipment based on our estimate of the future value of the equipment at the end of the lease term or end of the equipments estimated useful life if the market value of leased equipment decreases at a rate greater than we projected whether due to rapid technological or economic obsolescence unusual wear and tear on the equipment excessive use of the equipment recession or other adverse economic conditions impacting supply and demand it could adversely affect the current values or the residual values of such equipment financial reporting risks accounting standards may change and increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely affect our results the financial accounting standards board fasb and the sec periodically modify the standards governing the preparation of our financial statements the nature of these changes is not predictable and has impacted and could further impact how we record transactions in our financial statements which has led to and could lead to material changes in assets liabilities stockholders equity revenues expenses and net income implementation of new accounting rules or standards could additionally require us to implement technology changes which could impact ongoing earnings our accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations they require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain and such estimates may be materially different from actual results accounting policies and processes are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and processes so they comply with gaap in some cases management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances yet may result in us reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management to make difficult subjective or complex conclusions about matters that are uncertain materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates because of the uncertainty surrounding managements judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters we may be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements refer to critical accounting estimates included in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k our business is highly quantitative and requires widespread use of financial models for daytoday operations these models may produce inaccurate predictions that significantly vary from actual results and we may rely on these inaccurate predictions in making decisions that ultimately adversely affect our business we rely on qualitative and quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values such models may be used in many processes including but not limited to the pricing of various products and services classifications of loans setting interest rates on loans and deposits quantifying interest rate and other market risks forecasting losses measuring capital adequacy and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels models may also be used to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items inaccurate or erroneous models present the risk that business decisions relying on the models will prove inefficient ineffective or harmful to us additionally information we provide to our investors and regulators may be negatively impacted by inaccurately designed or implemented models for further information on risk monitoring refer to the risk management section included in item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk of this annual report on form 10k we may fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting which could hinder our ability to prevent fraud and provide reliable financial reports to key stakeholders we must have effective internal controls over financial reporting in order to provide reliable financial reports to effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company if we are unable to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud our reputation and operating results will be harmed and we may violate regulatory requirements or otherwise become subject to legal liability we may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies requiring remediation which would require additional expense and diversion of management attention among other consequences a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis any failure to maintain effective internal controls or to implement any necessary improvement of our internal controls in a timely manner could among other things result in losses from fraud or error harm our reputation or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information each of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and the market value of our common stock the svbb acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and is based upon a preliminary valuation that involves significant estimates that are subject to change as required by gaap the svbb acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and is based upon a preliminary valuation that involves significant estimates that are subject to change the opening balances of acquired assets and assumed liabilities in connection with the svbb acquisition have been recorded at estimated fair value based on information currently available to us in developing these fair value estimates management was required to make significant estimates involving among other things the assigned risk ratings to loans based on credit quality appraisals and estimated collateral values estimated expected cash flows and appropriate liquidity and discount rates the loans purchased in connection with the svbb acquisition have credit profiles that differ from most banking companies for example many of the legacy silicon valley bank loans acquired were made to earlystage privately held companies with modest or negative cash flows andor no established record of profitable operations in addition a significant portion of the loans were comprised of larger loans equal to or greater than million and collateral for many of the legacy silicon valley bank loans in the technology life science and healthcare industries include intellectual property and other intangible assets which are difficult to value and not readily salable in the case of default furthermore the receivables from the fdic for the commercial shared loss agreement involve significant estimates that involve uncertainty in addition the core deposit intangibles were valued using the aftertax cost savings method under the income approach this method estimates the fair value by discounting to present value the favorable funding spread attributable to the core deposit balances over their estimated average remaining lives the valuation considered a dynamic approach to interest rates and alternative cost of funds the favorable funding spread is calculated as the difference in the alternative cost of funds and the net deposit cost the estimates used in creating the preliminary fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed may change as additional information becomes available which could lead to changes in our fair value estimates we continue to review information relating to events or circumstances existing at the svbb acquisition date that could impact the preliminary fair value estimates until management finalizes its fair value estimates for the acquired assets and assumed liabilities the preliminary gain on acquisition can be updated for a period not to exceed one year following the svbb acquisition date the fair value measurements of certain other assets and liabilities are preliminary as we identify and assess information regarding the nature of these assets and liabilities and review the associated valuation assumptions and methodologies the tax treatment of fdicassisted acquisitions is complex and subject to interpretations that may result in future adjustments of deferred taxes as of the svbb acquisition date as such the amounts recorded for tax assets and liabilities are considered provisional as we continue to evaluate the nature and extent of permanent and temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed as well as the tax impact on the preliminary gain on acquisition
