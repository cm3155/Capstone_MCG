subject to the conditions set forth in the agreement and plan of merger as amended the merger agreement cit had consolidated total assets of approximately billion at december we expect substantive changes to our future results due to the merger with cit the cit merger some key anticipated reporting impacts related to the cit merger include but are not limited to i increases in our interest income from the loans acquired in the cit merger and expected originations and funding of similar types of loans ii increases in interest expense from deposits and debt assumed from cit iii higher

depreciation and maintenance costs on the operating lease portfolio and v higher net chargeoffs due to the loans acquired in the cit merger and expected originations and funding of similar types of loans we also expect changes in our regulatory capital ratios due to i increases in risk weighted assets from the assets acquired in the cit merger and ii increases in regulatory capital primarily related the conversion of common and preferred stock and the assumption of subordinated debt in connection with the cit merger the cit merger is described further in the business combinations section of this mda and in item business included in this annual report on form 10k yearoveryear comparisons of the financial results for and are contained in item of bancshares annual report on form 10k for

are intended to identify these forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are based on bancshares current expectations and assumptions regarding bancshares business the economy and other future conditions because forwardlooking statements relate to future results and occurrences they are subject to inherent risks uncertainties changes in circumstances and other factors that are difficult to predict many possible events or factors could affect bancshares future financial results and performance and could cause the actual results performance or achievements of bancshares to

market conditions the impacts of the global covid19 pandemic on bancshares business and customers the financial success or changing conditions or strategies of bancshares customers or vendors

to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of the forwardlooking statements included herein to reflect future events or developments critical accounting estimates the accounting and reporting policies of bancshares are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and are described in note a accounting policies and basis of presentation of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to exercise judgment in determining many of the estimates and assumptions utilized to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses our financial position and results of operations could be materially affected by changes to these estimates and assumptions we consider accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and ii different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period could have a material impact on our financial statements accounting policies related to the allowance for credit losses acl are considered to be critical accounting estimates as these policies involve considerable judgment and estimation by management the acl represents managements best estimate of credit losses expected over the life of the loan adjusted for expected contractual payments and the impact of prepayment expectations prepayment assumptions were developed through a review of bancshares historical prepayment activity and considered forecasts of relevant economic conditions as well as prepayment assumptions utilized in other modeling activities estimates for loan losses are determined by analyzing quantitative and qualitative components present as of the evaluation date adjustments to the acl are recorded with a corresponding entry to provision for credit losses loan balances considered uncollectible are chargedoff against the acl forecasted loss given defaults lgds are adjusted for expected recoveries and realized recoveries of amounts previously chargedoff are credited to the acl while management utilizes its best judgment and information available the ultimate adequacy of our acl is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control which are inherently difficult to predict the most significant being the economic scenario forecast used in the models our acl forecast considers a range of economic scenarios from an upside scenario to a severely adverse scenario and the december acl forecast was calculated using the consensus baseline scenario results ranged from approximately million in the upside scenario to approximately million in the severely adverse scenario our recorded acl at december totaled million significant macroeconomic factors used in estimating the expected losses include unemployment gross domestic product home price index and commercial real estate index current economic conditions and forecasts can change which could affect the anticipated amount of estimated credit losses and therefore the appropriateness of the acl it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall acl because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the acl and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types additionally changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others refer to note a accounting policies and basis of presentation in the notes to consolidated financial statements for

changes in consumer behavior and overall economic instability indicators of economic activity have begun to return to prepandemic levels but as progressed variants to covid19 led to a significant rise in cases this uncertainty contributed to continued volatility in the financial markets and supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation for a discussion of the risks we face with respect to the covid19 pandemic the associated economic uncertainty the steps taken to mitigate the pandemic and the resulting economic contraction refer to item risk factors included in this annual report on form 10k various external factors influence the focus of our business efforts and the results of our operations can change significantly based on those external factors based on the real gross domestic product gdp information available bureau of economic analysis bea release january the beas revised estimate for gdp showed an annual rate increase of percent in the fourth quarter of in contrast to a decrease of percent in in accordance with this bea release the increase in real gdp primarily reflected increases in private inventory investment exports personal consumption expenditures and nonresidential fixed investment imports which are a subtraction in the calculation of gdp increased

macroeconomic factors used in estimating the expected losses include unemployment gross domestic product home price index and commercial real estate index bancshares acl forecasts consider a range of economic scenarios from an upside scenario to a severely adverse scenario but the december acl forecast was calculated using the consensus baseline scenario this scenario showed improvements in the

are placed on nonaccrual all previously uncollected accrued interest is reversed from interest income and the ongoing accrual of interest is discontinued nonpcd loans and leases are generally removed from nonaccrual status when they become current for a sustained period of time as to both principal and interest and there is no longer concern as to the collectability of principal and interest accretion of income for pcd loans is discontinued when we are unable to estimate the amount or timing of cash flows pcd loans may begin or resume accretion of income when information becomes available that allows us to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows oreo includes foreclosed property and branch facilities that we have closed but not sold net book values of oreo are reviewed at least annually to evaluate if writedowns are required the level of review is dependent on the value and type of the collateral with higher value and more complex properties receiving a more detailed review changes to the value of the assets between scheduled valuation dates are monitored through communication with brokers and monthly reviews by the asset manager assigned to each asset the asset manager uses the information gathered from brokers and other market sources to identify any significant changes in the market or the subject property as they occur valuations are then adjusted or new appraisals are ordered to ensure the reported values reflect the most current information since oreo is carried at the lower of cost or market value less estimated selling costs book value adjustments
