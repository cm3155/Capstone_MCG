income related to sbappp loans totaled million in the second quarter of the primary drivers of the margin decline were lower yields on interestearning assets partially offset by a decrease in the rates paid on borrowings and interestbearing deposits largely in time deposits and money market accounts average interestearning assets increased by billion to billion compared to the second quarter of the primary drivers for this change were higher average loan balances which increased billion due to contributions from both recent acquisitions and loans originated under the sbappp as well as organic loan growth higher average investment securities of billion and higher average overnight investments of million the yield on interestearning assets decreased by basis points to when compared to the second quarter of the yield on loans and leases decreased to or by basis points primarily due to lower yields on commercial and home equity loans mostly due to downward rate resets on variable rate loans and lower rates on originations the yield on overnight investments and investment securities decreased by basis points and basis points respectively the yield decrease on overnight investments was primarily due to a lower federal funds rate while lower yields on government agency and mortgagebacked securities were the primary reasons for the investment securities yield decline average interestbearing liabilities increased by billion to billion compared to the second quarter of this increase was primarily due to an increase in average interestbearing deposit balances of

allowable alternative provides bancshares the ability to use the federal income tax rate for certain current year deductible amounts related to prior year fdicassisted acquisitions that was applicable when these amounts were originally subjected to tax as a result of this favorable federal tax rate benefit the effective tax rate for the remainder of is estimated to be approximately the actual effective tax rate will depend upon the nature and amount of future income and expenses as well as transactions with discrete tax effects we monitor and evaluate the potential impact of current events

auditors within the jurisdictions where bancshares is required to file income tax returns as well as potential or pending audits or assessments by tax auditors interestearning assets interestearning assets include investment securities loans and leases and overnight investments all of which reflect varying interest rates based on the risk level and repricing characteristics of the underlying asset riskier investments typically carry a higher interest rate but expose us to higher levels of market risk we strive to maintain a high level of interestearning assets relative to total assets while keeping nonearning assets at a minimum interestearning assets totaled billion and billion at june and december respectively the billion increase was primarily composed of a billion increase in loans and leases a billion increase in investment securities and a billion increase in overnight investments investment securities the primary objective of the investment portfolio is to generate incremental income by deploying excess funds into securities with minimal liquidity and credit risk and low to moderate interest rate risk other objectives include acting as a stable source of liquidity serving as a tool for asset and liability management and maintaining an interest rate risk profile compatible with bancshares objectives additionally purchases of equities and corporate bonds in other financial institutions have been made largely under a longterm earnings optimization strategy changes in the total balance of our investment portfolio result from trends in balance sheet funding and market performance generally when inflows arising from deposit and treasury services products exceed loan and lease demand we invest excess funds into the securities portfolio and into overnight investments conversely when loan demand exceeds growth in deposits and shortterm borrowings we allow overnight investments to decline and use proceeds from maturing securities and prepayments to fund loan demand see note c investments for additional disclosures the carrying value of investment securities totaled billion at june an increase of billion compared to december the

securities available for sale had a net pretax unrealized gain of million compared to a net pretax unrealized gain of million as of december after evaluating the available for sale securities with

loans partially offset by an increase of million in the acl on pcd loans the decrease in the acl on nonpcd loans was primarily in the commercial segments as these portfolios have exhibited strong historical credit performance and have relatively short average lives this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the consumer segments due to their longer average lives the increase in the acl on pcd loans was primarily the result of reallocating credit discount from loan balances into acl the acl is calculated using a variety of factors including but not limited to chargeoff and recovery activity loan growth changes in macroeconomic factors collateral type estimated loan life and changes in credit quality for the period ended june the primary reason for the acl change since the adoption of asc was a million reserve build due to the potential economic impact of covid19 and its estimated impact on credit losses forecasted economic conditions are developed using third party macroeconomic scenarios adjusted based on managements expectations over a forecast period of two years assumptions revert to long term historic averages over a one year period significant macroeconomic factors used in estimating the expected losses include unemployment gross domestic product home price index and commercial real estate index our model results included baseline adverse and upside scenarios as well as managements expectation of borrower performance based upon covid19 residual risk by industry and geography expected loss estimates considered the potential impact of slower economic activity and elevated unemployment as well as mitigating impacts from the government stimulus and loan modification programs these loss estimates were also influenced by bancshares

conservative approach to risk taking with a philosophy that does not preclude higher risk business activities balanced with acceptable returns while meeting regulatory objectives through the comprehensive enterprise risk management framework and risk appetite framework senior management has primary responsibility for daytoday management of the risks we face with accountability of and support from all associates senior management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which bancshares activities may be exposed with effective challenge and oversight by management committees in addition the board of directors strives to ensure that the business culture is integrated with the enterprise risk management program and that policies procedures and metrics for identifying assessing measuring monitoring and managing risk are part of the decisionmaking process the board of directors role in risk oversight is an integral part of our overall enterprise risk management framework and risk appetite framework the board of directors administers its risk oversight function primarily through the board risk committee the board risk committee structure is designed to allow for information flow effective challenge and timely escalation of riskrelated issues the board risk committee is directed to monitor and advise the board of directors regarding risk exposures including credit market capital liquidity operational compliance strategic and reputational risks review approve and monitor adherence to the risk appetite and supporting risk tolerance levels via a series of established metrics and evaluate monitor and oversee the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management framework and risk appetite framework the board risk committee also reviews reports of examination by and communications from regulatory agencies the results of internal and third party testing and qualitative and quantitative assessments related to risk management and any other matters within the scope of the committees oversight responsibilities the board risk committee monitors managements response to certain riskrelated regulatory and audit issues in addition the board risk committee may coordinate with the audit committee and the compensation nominations and governance committee for the review of financial statements and related risks information security and other areas of joint responsibility in combination with other risk management and monitoring practices enterprisewide stress testing activities are part of the risk management framework and conducted within a defined framework stress tests are performed for various risks to ensure the financial institution can support continued operations during stressed periods in response to covid19 bancshares assembled a crossfunctional leadership team to identify and manage newly identified risks and provide effective risk oversight through this pandemic new or elevated risks have been identified in multiple areas including but not limited to operational risk credit risk market risk liquidity risk capital adequacy risk compliance risk and financial reporting risk as such we have incorporated changes to item risk factors within this quarterly report on form 10q to capture these changes these new or increased areas of risk are being actively managed by senior leadership and have been incorporated into reporting for key management committees and regular updates are being provided to the board of directors credit risk management credit risk is the risk of not collecting payments pursuant to the contractual terms of loans leases and certain investment securities loans and leases we originate are underwritten in accordance with our credit policies and procedures and are subject to periodic ongoing reviews acquired loans regardless of whether pcd or nonpcd are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date and are subject to periodic reviews to identify any further credit deterioration our independent credit review function conducts risk reviews and analyses of both originated and acquired loans to ensure compliance with credit policies and to monitor asset quality trends and borrower financial strength these reviews include portfolio analysis by geographic location industry collateral type and product we strive to identify potential problem loans as early as possible to record chargeoffs or writedowns as appropriate and to maintain an adequate acl that accounts for losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio we are actively monitoring our loan portfolio for areas of increased risk as a result of covid19 as of july covid19 related loan extensions decreased to approximately billion in outstanding loan balances representing approximately million in payment deferrals the first wave of loans with payment deferrals have completed their extension period and the volume of extension requests declined during the second quarter a significant portion of the original payment extensions approximately billion have moved to active status as of july to date we have not seen significant shifts in credit line utilization or declines in overall credit quality additionally we are participating in the sbappp program which provided much needed funds to our existing small business customers and we continue to assess both the credit and operational risks this program presents bancshares originated approximately sbappp loan requests with an outstanding balance of billion at june our acl estimate for the quarter ended june included extensive reviews of the changes in credit risk associated with the loan portfolio and uncertainties around economic forecasts and the overall economic impact of covid19 expected loss estimates within each portfolio considered the potential impact of slower economic activity with increasing unemployment as well as potential mitigating impacts from the government stimulus and loan modification programs these loss estimates additionally considered bancshares industry and geography risk historically strong credit quality and actual net losses incurred during prior periods of economic stress as well as recent credit trends which have not seen deterioration from covid19 as of june interest rate risk management interest rate risk irr results principally from assets and liabilities maturing or repricing at different points in time assets and liabilities repricing at the same point in time but in different amounts and shortterm and longterm interest rates changing in different magnitudes we assess our shortterm irr by forecasting net interest income over months under various interest rate scenarios and comparing those results to forecasted net interest income assuming stable rates irr scenarios modeled include but are not limited to immediate parallel rate shocks interest rate ramps changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in the relationships of our rates to market rates market interest rates declined significantly from yearend driven by economic uncertainty brought on by covid19 net interest income deterioration in down rate shocks will remain muted due to the low absolute value of market interest rates assumptions that incorporate customer migration from low rate deposit instruments to intermediate term fixed rate instruments as rates rise have been adjusted based on actual deposit behavior over the last years during a rising rate cycle table provides the impact on net interest income over months resulting from various instantaneous interest rate shock scenarios as of june and december table net interest income sensitivity analysis estimated percentage increase decrease in net interest income change in interest rate basis points june december the increased asset sensitivity in net interest income sensitivity metrics as of june compared to december were primarily affected by a significant influx of nonmaturity deposits during the second quarter of related to participation in the sbappp as well as consumer stimulus payments generating large overnight cash balances longterm interest rate risk exposure is measured using the economic value of equity eve sensitivity analysis to study the impact of longterm cash flows on earnings and capital eve represents the difference between the sum of the present value of all asset cash flows and the sum of the present value of the liability cash flows eve sensitivity analysis involves discounting cash flows of balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios cash flows will vary by interest rate scenario resulting in variations in eve the basecase measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow management to measure longerterm repricing and option risk in the balance sheet table table presents the eve profile as of june and december table economic value of equity modeling analysis estimated percentage increase decrease in eve change in interest rate basis points june december the economic value of equity metrics at june compared to december were primarily affected by substantial growth in demand deposits of nearly billion during the second quarter of we do not typically utilize interest rate swaps floors collars or other derivative financial instruments to hedge our overall balance sheet interest rate sensitivity and risk liquidity risk management liquidity risk is the risk that an institution will be unable to generate or obtain sufficient cash or its equivalents on a costeffective basis to meet commitments as they fall due the most common sources of liquidity risk arise from mismatches in the timing and value of onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet cash inflows and outflows in general onbalance sheet mismatches generate liquidity risk when the effective maturity of assets exceeds the effective maturity of liabilities a commonly cited example of a balance sheet liquidity mismatch is when longterm loans assets are funded with shortterm borrowings liabilities other forms of liquidity risk include market constraints on the ability to convert assets into cash at expected levels an inability to access funding sources at sufficient levels at a reasonable cost and changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit market operational legal and reputation risks that can affect an institutions liquidity risk profile we utilize various limitbased measures to monitor measure and control three different categories of liquidity risk tactical measures the risk of a negative cash flow position whereby cash outflows exceed cash inflows over a shortterm horizon out to nine weeks structural measures the amount by which illiquid assets are supported by longterm funding and contingent measures the risk of having insufficient liquidity sources to support cash needs under potential future stressed market conditions or having an inability to access wholesale funding sources in a timely and cost effective manner we aim to maintain a diverse mix of liquidity sources to support the liquidity management function while aiming to avoid funding concentrations by diversifying our external funding with respect to maturities counterparties and nature our primary source of liquidity is our retail deposit book due to the generally stable balances and low cost it offers additional sources include cash in excess of our reserve requirement at the federal reserve bank and various other corresponding bank accounts and unencumbered securities which totaled billion at june compared to billion at december another source of available funds was advances from the fhlb of atlanta and chicago outstanding fhlb advances were million as of june and we had sufficient collateral pledged to secure billion of additional borrowings from the fhlb of atlanta also at june billion in nonpcd loans with a lendable collateral value of billion were used to create additional borrowing capacity at the federal reserve bank we also maintain federal funds lines and other credit lines which had million of available capacity at june critical accounting estimates except as described below there have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates as described in our annual report on form 10k allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases replaces the allowance for loan and leases losses as a critical accounting estimate as of january with the adoption of asu financial instrumentscredit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments the allowance for credit losses represents managements best estimate of current expected credit losses over the life of the portfolio of loan and leases estimating credit losses requires judgment in determining loan specific attributes impacting the borrowers ability to repay contractual obligations other factors such as economic forecasts used to determine a reasonable and supportable forecast prepayment assumptions the value of underlying collateral and changes in size composition and risks within the portfolio are also considered the allowance for credit losses is assessed at each balance sheet date and adjustments are recorded in the provision for credit losses the allowance is estimated based on loan level characteristics using historical loss rates a reasonable and supportable economic forecast with reversion to historical assumptions loan losses are estimated using the fair value of collateral for collateraldependent loans or when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty such that repayment of the loan is expected to be made through the operation or sale of the collateral loan balances considered uncollectible are chargedoff against the acl recoveries of amounts previously chargedoff are credited to the acl pcd assets represent assets that are acquired with evidence of more than insignificant credit quality deterioration since origination at the acquisition date at acquisition the allowance for credit losses on pcd assets is booked directly the acl any subsequent changes in the acl on pcd assets is recorded through the provision for credit losses management believes that the acl is adequate to absorb the expected life of loan credit losses on the portfolio of loans and leases as of the balance sheet date actual losses incurred may differ materially from our estimates particularly the impact of covid19 on both borrower credit and the greater macroeconomic environment is uncertain and changes in the duration spread and severity of the virus will affect our loss experience forwardlooking statements statements in this quarterly report on form 10q and exhibits relating to plans strategies economic performance and trends projections of
