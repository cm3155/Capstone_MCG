first quarter of a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 spread throughout the world causing significant disruptions to the domestic and global economies in response to the outbreak governments imposed restrictions resulting in business shutdowns regional quarantines disruptions of supply chains changes in consumer behavior and overall economic instability in recent months covid19 vaccines have been approved and are now generally available for use in the united states and certain other countries however we cannot predict how widely utilized they will be or whether they will be effective in preventing the spread of covid19 including its variants although we cannot predict when or if normal economic activity and business operations will resume we did observe general declines in the level of economic uncertainty and stabilization of macroeconomic forecasts during the first half of in recent weeks we have seen an uptick in the number of new cases although the absolute level of these new cases is significantly below the levels witnessed at the height of the pandemic we are unable to predict whether these trends will continue and how this will affect the overall economy at the current time however we remain vigilant in our review and monitoring efforts around the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic including any of its variants and its effects on the overall economy and our financial results during the second quarter of the federal reserves federal open market committee fomc maintained the federal funds rate at a target range of to the fomc acknowledged the economys

results of operations net interest income and margin taxableequivalent basis second quarter compared to second quarter taxableequivalent net interest income was million for the second quarter of an increase of million or compared to the second quarter of this was primarily due to lower rates paid on interestbearing deposits an increase in interest and fee income on sbappp loans and organic loan growth partially offset by a decline in the yield on interestearning assets sbappp loans contributed million in interest and fee income during the second quarter of compared to million in the second quarter of the taxableequivalent nim was in the second quarter of a decrease of basis points from the comparable quarter in the prior year the margin decline was primarily due to changes in earning asset mix as excess liquidity drove an increase in overnight investments as a percentage of total assets this was coupled with a decline in the yield on interestearning assets and partially offset by lower rates paid on interestbearing deposits and the yield on sbappp loans average interestearning assets increased by billion to billion compared to the second quarter of the primary drivers for this change were the excess liquidity build up which led to higher average overnight investments of billion a billion increase in average loan balances due to sbappp loans as well as organic loan growth and higher average investment securities of billion the yield on interestearning assets decreased by basis points to when compared to the second quarter of the yield on loans and leases decreased to or by basis points as a result of downward rate resets on variable rate loans and lower rates on new fixed rate loans the yield on overnight investments increased one basis point but the large increase in average balances resulted in a change in earning asset mix which contributed to an overall decline in the yield the yield on investment securities decreased by basis points primarily due to increased premium amortization on mortgagebacked securities as a result of higher than expected prepayments average interestbearing liabilities increased by billion to billion compared to the second quarter of this increase was driven by an increase in average interestbearing deposit balances of billion driven by strong deposit growth this was partially offset by a decrease in average longterm borrowings of million rates on interestbearing liabilities decreased by basis points to primarily due to decreased rates paid on interestbearing deposits as a result of maturing time deposits and a reduction in rates paid on money market accounts this is coupled with lower rates paid on borrowings six months of compared to six months of the taxableequivalent net interest income for the six months ended june was million an increase of million or compared to the same period in the increase in net interest income was primarily due to a decrease in total interest expense of million driven

driven by a decrease in yields partially offset by the impact of sbappp loans the taxableequivalent nim was for the six months ended june a decrease of basis points from the comparable period of th e

sbappp loans on loan yields average yeartodate interestearning assets for the six months ended june increased by billion to billion compared to the same period in this increase was driven by an increase in average overnight investments of billion coupled with a billion increase in average loans outstanding and increases in average investment securities of billion the yield on interestearning assets decreased by basis points to for the six months ended june compared to the same period in the yield on loans and leases decreased by basis points as a result of decreases in yields on commercial and residential loans the yield on overnight investments and the investment securities portfolio decreased by basis points and basis points respectively the lower federal funds rate was the primary driver for the yield decrease on overnight investments while the accelerated prepayments on mortgagebacked securities and reinvestment at lower yields were the primary drivers of the yield decline on investment securities average yeartodate interestbearing liabilities for the six months ended june increased by billion to billion compared to the same period in this increase was primarily due to a billion increase in average interestbearing deposit balances driven by deposit growth the rate paid on interestbearing deposits decreased by basis points driven by decreased rates on time deposits and money market accounts the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities decreased by basis points to for the six months ended june compared to the same period in driven by maturing time

expense for the comparable quarter in for the six months ended june provision for credit losses was a benefit of million compared to million in expense for the first six months of the change was

were originally subjected to tax without this alternative the effective tax rate for the second quarter and first six months of would have been approximately we monitor and evaluate the potential impact of current events on the estimates used to establish income tax expenses and income tax liabilities on a periodic basis we evaluate our income tax positions based on current tax law positions taken by various tax auditors within the jurisdictions where bancshares is required to file income tax returns as well as potential or pending audits or assessments by tax auditors interestearning assets interestearning assets include overnight investments investment securities and loans and leases all of which reflect varying interest rates based on the risk level and repricing characteristics of the underlying asset riskier investments typically carry a higher interest rate but expose us to higher levels of market risk we strive to maintain a high level of interestearning assets relative to total assets while keeping nonearning assets at a minimum interestearning assets totaled billion and billion at june and december respectively the billion increase was primarily composed of a billion increase in overnight investments and a million increase in investment securities partially offset by a million decrease in loans investment securities the primary objective of the investment portfolio is to generate incremental income by deploying excess funds into securities with minimal liquidity and credit risk and low to moderate interest rate risk other objectives include acting as a stable source of liquidity serving as a tool for asset and liability management and maintaining an interest rate risk profile compatible with bancshares objectives additionally purchases of equities and corporate bonds in other financial institutions have been made largely under a longterm earnings optimization strategy changes in the total balance of our investment portfolio result from trends in balance sheet funding and market performance generally when inflows arising from deposit and treasury services products exceed loan and lease demand we invest excess funds into the securities portfolio and into overnight investments conversely when loan demand exceeds growth in deposits and shortterm borrowings we allow overnight investments to decline and use proceeds from maturing securities and prepayments to fund loan demand see note c investments for additional disclosures the carrying value of investment securities totaled billion at june an increase of million compared to

investment securities available for sale had a net pretax unrealized gain of million compared to a net pretax unrealized gain of million as of december management evaluated the available for sale

maintaining a strong liquidity position core deposit retention remains a key business objective we believe traditional bank deposit products remain an attractive option for many customers as evidenced by the significant deposit growth the industry has experienced over the past months as economic conditions improve we recognize that our liquidity position could be adversely affected as bank deposits are withdrawn our ability to fund future loan growth is significantly dependent on our success at retaining existing deposits and generating new deposits at a reasonable cost at june total deposits

risk management risk is inherent in any business bancshares has defined a moderate risk appetite a conservative approach to risk taking with a philosophy that does not preclude higher risk business activities balanced with acceptable returns while meeting regulatory objectives through the comprehensive enterprise risk management framework and risk appetite framework senior management has primary responsibility for daytoday management of the risks we face with accountability of and support from all associates senior management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which bancshares activities may be exposed with effective challenge and oversight by management committees in addition the board of directors strives to ensure that the business culture is integrated with the enterprise risk management program and that policies procedures and metrics for identifying assessing measuring monitoring and managing risk are part of the decisionmaking process the board of directors role in risk oversight is an integral part of our overall enterprise risk management framework and risk appetite framework the board of directors administers its risk oversight function primarily through the board risk committee the board risk committee structure is designed to allow for information flow effective challenge and timely escalation of riskrelated issues the board risk committee is directed to monitor and advise the board of directors regarding risk exposures including credit market capital liquidity operational compliance strategic and reputational risks review approve and monitor adherence to the risk appetite and supporting risk tolerance levels via a series of established metrics and evaluate monitor and oversee the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management framework and risk appetite framework the board risk committee also reviews reports of examination by and communications from regulatory agencies the results of internal and third party testing and qualitative and quantitative assessments related to risk management and any other matters within the scope of the committees oversight responsibilities the board risk committee monitors managements response to certain riskrelated regulatory and audit issues in addition the board risk committee may coordinate with the audit committee and the compensation nominations and governance committee for the review of financial statements and related risks information security and other areas of joint responsibility in combination with other risk management and monitoring practices enterprisewide stress testing activities are part of the risk management framework and conducted within a defined framework stress tests are performed for various risks to ensure the financial institution can support continued operations during stressed periods credit risk management credit risk is the risk of not collecting payments pursuant to the contractual terms of loans leases and certain investment securities loans and leases we originate are underwritten in accordance with our credit policies and procedures and are subject to periodic ongoing reviews acquired loans regardless of whether pcd or nonpcd are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date and are subject to periodic reviews to identify any further credit deterioration our independent credit review function conducts risk reviews and analyses of both originated and acquired loans to ensure compliance with credit policies and to monitor asset quality trends and borrower financial strength these reviews include portfolio analysis by geographic location industry collateral type and product we strive to identify potential problem loans as early as possible to record chargeoffs or writedowns as appropriate and to maintain an adequate acl that accounts for expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio we continue to actively monitor our loan portfolio for areas of increased risk as a result of covid19 and to date have not seen any significant declines in credit quality through june over of all covid19 related loan extensions have begun repayment additionally we participated in both rounds of funding in the sbappp program which provided much needed funds to our existing small business customers we continue to assess both the credit and operational risks this program presents and at june bancshares had billion in sbappp loans outstanding interest rate risk management interest rate risk irr results principally from assets and liabilities maturing or repricing at different points in time assets and liabilities repricing at the same point in time but in different amounts and shortterm and longterm interest rates changing in different magnitudes we assess our shortterm irr by forecasting net interest income over months under various interest rate scenarios and comparing those results to forecasted net interest income assuming stable rates irr scenarios modeled include but are not limited to immediate parallel rate shocks interest rate ramps changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in the relationships of our rates to market rates market interest rates have increased from yearend driven by improving economic conditions net interest income deterioration in down rate shocks will remain muted due to the low absolute value of market interest rates assumptions that incorporate customer migration from low rate deposit instruments to intermediate term fixed rate instruments as rates rise have been adjusted based on actual deposit behavior over the last three years during a rising rate cycle table provides the impact on net interest income over months resulting from various instantaneous interest rate shock scenarios as of june and december table net interest income sensitivity analysis estimated percentage decrease increase in net interest income change in interest rate basis points june december the decreased asset sensitivity in net interest income sensitivity metrics as of june compared to december resulted from a deployment of excess liquidity out of lowyielding overnight cash predominantly into investment securities longterm interest rate risk exposure is measured using the economic value of equity eve sensitivity analysis to study the impact of longterm cash flows on earnings and capital eve represents the difference between the sum of the present value of all asset cash flows and the sum of the present value of the liability cash flows eve sensitivity analysis involves discounting cash flows of balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios cash flows will vary by interest rate scenario resulting in variations in eve the basecase measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow management to measure longerterm repricing and option risk in the balance sheet table presents the eve profile as of june and december table economic value of equity modeling analysis estimated percentage decrease increase in eve change in interest rate basis points june december the economic value of equity metrics at june compared to december were primarily affected by redeployment of excess funds during the second quarter of coupled with lower market interest rates we do not typically utilize interest rate swaps floors collars or other derivative financial instruments to hedge our overall balance sheet interest rate sensitivity and risk liquidity risk management liquidity risk is the risk that an institution will be unable to generate or obtain sufficient cash or its equivalents on a costeffective basis to meet commitments as they fall due the most common sources of liquidity risk arise from mismatches in the timing and value of onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet cash inflows and outflows in general onbalance sheet mismatches generate liquidity risk when the effective maturity of assets exceeds the effective maturity of liabilities a commonly cited example of a balance sheet liquidity mismatch is when longterm loans assets are funded with shortterm borrowings liabilities other forms of liquidity risk include market constraints on the ability to convert assets into cash at expected levels an inability to access funding sources at sufficient levels at a reasonable cost and changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit market operational legal and reputation risks that can affect an institutions liquidity risk profile we utilize various limitbased measures to monitor measure and control three different categories of liquidity risk tactical measures the risk of a negative cash flow position whereby cash outflows exceed cash inflows over a shortterm horizon out to nine weeks structural measures the amount by which illiquid assets are supported by longterm funding and contingent measures the risk of having insufficient liquidity sources to support cash needs under potential future stressed market conditions or having an inability to access wholesale funding sources in a timely and cost effective manner we aim to maintain a diverse mix of liquidity sources to support the liquidity management function while aiming to avoid funding concentrations by diversifying our external funding with respect to maturities counterparties and nature our primary source of liquidity is our branchgenerated retail deposit portfolio due to the generally stable balances and low cost additional sources include cash in excess of our reserve requirement at the federal reserve bank and various other corresponding bank accounts and unencumbered securities which totaled billion at june compared to billion at december another source of available funds was advances from the fhlb of atlanta outstanding fhlb advances were million as of june and we had sufficient collateral pledged to secure billion of additional borrowings from the fhlb of atlanta also at june billion in nonpcd loans with a lendable collateral value of billion were used to create additional borrowing capacity at the federal reserve bank we also maintain federal funds lines and other credit lines which had million of available capacity at june offbalance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business we are a party to certain financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk which we enter into in order to meet the financing needs of our customers
