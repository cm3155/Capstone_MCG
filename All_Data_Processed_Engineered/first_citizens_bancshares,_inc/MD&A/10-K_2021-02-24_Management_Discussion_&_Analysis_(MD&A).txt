accounting and reporting policies of bancshares are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and are described in note a accounting policies and basis of presentation of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to exercise judgment in determining many of the estimates and assumptions utilized to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses our financial position and results of operations could be materially affected by changes to these estimates and assumptions the following is a summary of the more critical areas where these critical assumptions and estimates could impact the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of bancshares a llowance for credit losses as of january bancshares adopted financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard update asu financial instrumentscredit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments asc which changed the methodology accounting policies and inputs used in determining the allowance for credit losses acl see note a accounting policies and basis of presentation in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of our accounting policies for the acl and the implementation impact of asc see note e allowance for credit losses in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures the acl represents the best estimate of expected credit losses on loans and leases as of the balance sheet date the acl is assessed at each balance sheet date and adjustments are recorded in provision for credit losses losses are estimated using historical loss rates and a projection of a reasonable and supportable macroeconomic forecast period which reverts to historical assumptions this estimation process requires judgment in determining the amount and timing of chargeoffs economic forecast assumptions and loan specific attributes impacting the borrowers ability to repay contractual obligations other factors such as the composition of and risks within the loan portfolio collateral values and prepayments are also considered loan balances considered uncollectible are charged off against the acl if it is probable a borrower will be unable to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement and a loss is probable a specific valuation allowance is determined recoveries of amounts previously chargedoff are generally credited to the acl financial measurements fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis examples of recurring uses of fair value include marketable equity securities investment securities available for sale and loans held for sale there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at december we also measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis examples include collateraldependent loans other real estate owned oreo goodwill and intangible assets assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date fair value is determined using different inputs and assumptions based upon the instrument being valued where observable market prices from transactions for identical assets or liabilities are not available we identify market prices for similar assets or liabilities if observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain for any such similar assets or liabilities we look to other modeling techniques which often incorporate unobservable inputs which are inherently subjective and require significant judgment fair value estimates requiring significant judgments are determined using various inputs developed by management with the appropriate skills understanding and knowledge of the underlying asset or liability to ensure the development of fair value estimates is reasonable typical pricing sources used in estimating fair values include but are not limited to active markets with high trading volume thirdparty pricing services external appraisals valuation models and commercial and residential evaluation reports in certain cases our assessments with respect to assumptions market participants would make may be inherently difficult to determine and the use of different assumptions could result in material changes to these fair value measurements see note p estimated fair values and note b business combinations in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures regarding fair value income taxes management estimates income tax expense using the asset and liability method

respect to the covid19 pandemic the associated economic uncertainty the steps taken to mitigate the pandemic and the resulting economic contraction see item risk factors in part i of this annual report on form 10k various external factors influence the focus of our business efforts and the results of our operations can change significantly based on those external factors based on the latest real gross domestic product gdp information available the bureau of economic analysis revised estimate of fourth quarter gdp growth was up from gdp growth in the fourth quarter the acceleration in real gdp in the fourth quarter reflected increases in exports nonresidential fixed investment personal consumption expenditures residential fixed investment and private inventory investment that were partly offset by decreases in state and local government spending and federal government spending imports which are a subtraction in the calculation of gdp increased the increase in fourth quarter gdp reflected both the continued economic recovery from the sharp declines earlier in the year and the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic including new restrictions and closures that took effect in some areas of the united states the full economic effects of the covid19 pandemic cannot be quantified in the gdp estimate for the fourth quarter of because the impacts are generally embedded in

objectives additionally purchases of equities and corporate bonds in other financial institutions have been made largely under a longterm earnings optimization strategy changes in the total balance of

million in the acl which included a decrease of million in the acl on nonpcd loans partially offset by an increase of million in the acl on pcd loans the decrease in the acl on nonpcd loans was primarily in the commercial segments as these portfolios have exhibited strong historical credit performance and have relatively short average lives this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the consumer segments due to their longer average lives the increase in the acl on pcd loans was primarily the result of reallocating credit discount from loan balances into the acl at the time of adoption of asc the scope and severity of the covid19 pandemic and the related impacts were unknown the economic forecasts did not project the impacts of the recession the acl is calculated using a variety of factors including but not limited to chargeoff and recovery activity loan growth changes in macroeconomic factors collateral type estimated loan life and changes in credit quality for the period ended december the primary reason for the acl change since the adoption of asc was a million reserve build due to the potential economic impact of covid19 and its estimated potential impact on credit losses forecasted economic conditions are developed using third party macroeconomic scenarios adjusted based on managements expectations over a reasonable and supportable forecast period of two years assumptions revert to the long term historic averages over a one year period significant macroeconomic factors used in estimating the expected losses include unemployment gross domestic product home price index and commercial real estate index our model results consider baseline adverse and upside scenarios to calculate the acl we utilized the baseline scenario which considers government stimulus and incorporates significant improvements to the most significant forecast assumptions when compared on the covid19impacted levels from early in as of december the baseline forecast utilized the following significant inputs over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period unemployment rates are projected to remain elevated and will generally decrease to just below by the end of gdp growth peak growth of in the first quarter of primarily decreasing to under in late home pricing index growth rates below in early which increase to close to in late commercial real estate index forecasted downturn beginning 1q21 with a maximum drop by the end of and then slowly improving towards positive growth the model result was calibrated using managements expectation of borrower performance based upon covid19 residual risk by industry these loss estimates were also influenced by strong credit quality low net chargeoffs and recent credit trends which remained relatively stable

percentage of nonpcd loans and leases excluding sbappp loans was at december aside from sbappp loans which have no allowance the decrease since december was primarily due to the adoption of asc partially offset by the forecasted potential economic impact of the covid19 pandemic on expected credit losses the adoption of asc resulted in a decrease of basis points while the covid19 reserve build resulted in an increase of basis points in the period after adoption of asc the acl on commercial portfolios increased million with the largest share of the increase within the nonowner occupied

reversed from interest income and the ongoing accrual of interest is discontinued nonpcd loans and leases are generally removed from nonaccrual status when they become current for a sustained period of time as to both principal and interest and there is no longer concern as to the collectability of principal and interest accretion of income for pcd loans is discontinued when we are unable to estimate the amount or timing of cash flows pcd loans may begin or resume accretion of income when information becomes available that allows us to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows oreo includes foreclosed property and branch facilities that we have closed but not sold net book values of oreo are reviewed at least annually to evaluate if writedowns are required the level of review is dependent on the value and type of the collateral with higher value and more complex properties receiving a more detailed review changes to the value of the assets between scheduled valuation dates are monitored through continued communication with brokers and monthly reviews by the asset manager assigned to each asset the asset manager uses the information gathered from brokers and other market sources to identify any significant changes in the market or the subject property as they occur valuations are then adjusted or new appraisals are ordered to ensure the reported values reflect the most current information since oreo is carried at the lower of cost or market value less estimated selling costs book value adjustments are only recorded when fair values have declined decisions regarding writedowns are based on factors including appraisals previous offers received on the property market conditions and the number of days the property has been on the market

was impacted by the dissolution of pci loan pools under the adoption of asc as those nonaccrual loans within performing pci pools were previously excluded from reporting as of december there were million of nonaccrual loans that had been released from performing pci pools the remaining increase in nonaccrual loans was primarily due to increases within our acquired residential real estate loan
