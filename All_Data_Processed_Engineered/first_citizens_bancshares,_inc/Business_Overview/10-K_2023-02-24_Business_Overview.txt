bancshares has over billion in total consolidated assets and is now subject to certain enhanced prudential standards and enhanced oversight under the applicable transition provisions of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act by the federal reserve board federal reserve or frb and the fdic with respect to fcb as bancshares continues to grow bancshares will become subject to additional regulatory requirements based on the tailored regulatory framework applicable to banking organizations with billion or more in total assets and adopted by the federal banking agencies pursuant to the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act the egrrcpa in connection with the cit merger fcb established as a whollyowned subsidiary fc international inc fc international which is a corporation chartered by the federal reserve pursuant to section of the federal reserve act edge act and the federal reserves regulation k edge act corporations are international banking organizations that are authorized to engage in international banking and foreign financial transactions and the us activities of such corporations are generally limited to those that are incidental to their foreign operations fcb established fc international for the purpose of holding the equity interests in the foreign nonbank subsidiaries foreign companies

services regulatory environment imposed significant regulatory and compliance changes on the financial services industry increased capital leverage and liquidity requirements for banking organizations and expanded the scope of oversight responsibility of certain federal agencies through the creation of new oversight bodies for example the doddfrank act established the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb with broad powers to supervise and enforce federal consumer financial protection laws egrrcpa enacted in the egrrcpa while largely preserving the fundamental elements of the postdoddfrank act regulatory framework modified certain requirements of the doddfrank act as they applied to regional and community banking organizations certain of the significant requirements of the doddfrank act are listed below with information regarding how they apply to bancshares following the enactment of the egrrcpa asset threshold for applicability of doddfrank act enhanced prudential standards and enhanced supervision the doddfrank act mandated the applicability of enhanced prudential standards including enhanced liquidity and capital requirements enterprisewide risk management requirements concentration limits resolution plans and credit exposure report requirements etc and enhanced supervision of bank holding companies with billion or more in assets the egrrcpa raised the asset threshold for mandatory applicability of enhanced prudential standards to billion or more in total consolidated assets and gives the frb the discretion to apply any enhanced prudential standards to banking organizations with billion or more in total assets on a tailored basis based on asset size and other riskrelated factors to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the united states or to promote the safety and soundness of a bank holding company in november the frb along with the fdic and the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ adopted a framework for tailoring the applicability of enhanced prudential standards for banking organizations with billion or more in assets the tailoring rules the tailoring rules are further discussed below total assets are calculated based on a trailing fourquarter average bancshares first became subject to the enhanced prudential standards in connection with the cit merger and now bancshares is treated as a category iv banking organization under the tailoring rules as further discussed below capital planning and stress testing the doddfrank act mandated companyrun stress tests be performed by banking organizations with billion or more in total assets to ensure financial institutions have sufficient capital to absorb losses and support operations during multiple economic and bank scenarios the egrrcpa gave immediate relief from the doddfrank act and companyrun stress testing for banking organizations with less than billion in total consolidated assets therefore bancshares is not subject to doddfrank act companyrun stress testing dfast until such time that it has billion or more in total assets based on a trailing fourquarter average notwithstanding these amendments to the stress testing requirements bank holding companies with billion or more in total consolidated assets are subject to supervisory stress testing by the frb under the federal reserves comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar bancshares has over billion in total consolidated assets and we are subject to biennial supervisory stress testing by the federal reserve under the ccar process as a category iv banking organization in accordance with the applicable transition provisions bancshares as a category iv banking organization is also required to develop maintain and submit an annual capital plan to the federal reserve bancshares has made substantial progress in developing policies programs and systems designed to comply with capital planning and stress testing requirements resolution planning under the doddfrank act as amended by the egrrcpa bank holding companies with billion or more in total consolidated assets are required to develop and maintain resolution plans commonly referred to as living wills to support the orderly resolution of large banking organizations under the regulations promulgated by the frb and fdic implementing the living wills requirement currently only category i ii and iii banking organizations are required to submit resolution plans therefore bancshares as a category iv banking organization is not required to submit a resolution plan under the living wills requirement as further discussed below fcb is required to submit a resolution plan under the fdics resolution plan requirement for insured depository institutions idis with billion or more in total consolidated assets under its covered insured depository institution rule cidi rule the volcker rule the volcker rule was promulgated to implement provisions of the doddfrank act it generally prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds subject to certain exemptions the egrrcpa exempted many financial institutions with total consolidated assets of less than billion from the volcker rule but it continues to apply to bancshares however the volcker rule does not significantly impact our operations as we do not have any significant engagement in such prohibited businesses abilitytorepay and qualified mortgage rule creditors are required to comply with mortgage reform provisions prohibiting the origination of any residential mortgages that do not meet rigorous qualified mortgage qm standards or abilitytorepay atr standards all mortgage loans originated by fcb meet atr standards and a substantial majority also meet qm standards the egrrcpa impact on the original atr and qm standards is only applicable to banks with less than billion in total consolidated assets reciprocal deposits are not treated as brokered deposits section of the federal deposit insurance act the fdi act and the fdics implementing regulations limit the ability of an idi to accept brokered deposits unless the institution is wellcapitalized under the prompt corrective action the pca under the fdi act or the idi is adequately capitalized and obtains a waiver from the fdic idis that are less than wellcapitalized are not able to accept brokered deposits and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates paid on deposits in addition deposits that are considered brokered are subject to higher deposit assessments egrrcpa amended the fdi act to add a limited exception under which idis that are wellcapitalized or adequately capitalized and meet certain other criteria are able to exempt from treatment as brokered deposits up to billion or percent of the institutions total liabilities in reciprocal deposits defined generally as deposits received by a depository institution through a deposit placement network with the same maturity and in the same aggregate amount as deposits placed by the depository institution in other network institutions in addition in december the fdic amended its regulations governing brokered deposits to clarify and modernize this regulatory framework notable aspects of the final rule include the establishment of brightline standards for determining whether an entity meets the statutory definition of deposit broker the identification of a number of business relationships that qualify for the primary purpose exception for agents to avoid being deemed a deposit broker for the placement of funds with depository institutions the establishment of a more transparent application process for entities that seek to rely upon the primary purpose exception but do not qualify for one of the identified exceptions for business relationships deemed to satisfy the primary purpose exception and the clarification that third parties that have an exclusive depositplacement arrangement with one idi are not considered a deposit broker the final rule became effective april with full compliance required by january first citizens bancshares inc

standards as implemented by the tailoring rules under the tailoring rules banking organizations are grouped into four categories based on asset size offbalance sheet exposure nonbank assets weighted shortterm wholesale funding and crossjurisdictional activities category i banking organizations ie us gsibs are subject to the most stringent enhanced prudential requirements and category iv banking organizations ie between billion and billion in total consolidated assets and less than billion in nonbank assets offbalance sheet exposure crossjurisdictional activities and weighted shortterm wholesale funding are subject to the least stringent requirements bancshares has between billion and billion in total consolidated assets and therefore is required to comply with certain enhanced prudential standards applicable to category iv banking organizations subject to the applicable transition periods bancshares has developed policies programs and systems designed to meet such enhanced prudential standards including annual capital plan submissions and supervisory stress testing by the federal reserve under ccar enhanced enterprisewide risk management requirements and enhanced liquidity management requirements including liquidity stress tests and liquidity buffer requirements in the event bancshares assets grow to meet or exceed the thresholds for the asset size or other riskbased factors bancshares will be subject to other enhanced prudential standards on a tailored basis for example if bancshares has billion or more in weighted shortterm wholesale funding it will be

bhca a bank holding company must obtain approval from the federal reserve prior to directly or indirectly acquiring ownership or control of of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of another bank holding company or bank or prior to merging or consolidating with another bank holding company the bhca and other federal laws enumerate the factors the federal reserve must consider when reviewing the merger of bank holding companies the acquisition of banks or the acquisition of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company these factors include the competitive effects of the proposal in the relevant geographic markets the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the companies and banks involved in the transaction the effect of the transaction on the financial stability of the united states the organizations compliance with antimoney laundering laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served and the records of

category iv banking organization bancshares will transition from the federal reserves rfi rating system to the rating system for large financial institutions lfi referred to as the lfi rating system under the lfi rating system the frb assigns ratings based on three supervisory components i capital planning and positions ii liquidity risk management and positions and iii governance and controls the lfi rating system scale differs from the rfi rating system scale the lfi rating system has a fourcategory nonnumeric rating scale with no single composite rating or scoring the four rating categories are broadly meets expectations conditionally meets expectations deficient1 and deficient2 a banking organization must receive at least conditionally meets expectations for each of the component ratings to be considered well managed if a fhc ceases to meet these capital and management requirements the federal reserve may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities capital requirements the federal reserve imposes certain capital requirements on bank holding companies under the bhca including a minimum leverage ratio and minimum ratios of qualifying capital to riskweighted assets the metrics utilized to measure regulatory capital include the tier leverage ratio and the total tier and common equity tier risk based capital ratios collectively the regulatory capital ratios federal banking agencies approved regulatory capital guidelines basel iii aimed at strengthening previous capital requirements for banking organizations basel iii became effective for bancshares on january and the associated capital conservation buffers of were fully phased in by january the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress additionally federal banking agencies have developed pca wellcapitalized thresholds for regulatory capital ratios the following table includes the basel iii requirements and pca wellcapitalized thresholds for the regulatory capital ratios table start basel iii minimums basel iii conservation buffers basel iii requirements pca wellcapitalized thresholds regulatory capital ratios total riskbased capital tier riskbased capital common equity tier tier leverage table end failure to meet regulatory capital requirements may result in certain actions by federal banking agencies that could have a direct material effect on the consolidated financial statements of bancshares and constraints on capital distributions and discretionary executive compensation as of december the regulatory capital ratios of bancshares exceeded the applicable basel iii requirements and the wellcapitalized thresholds as further addressed under stockholders equity and capital adequacy in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as a result of the cit merger bancshares will be subject to the federal reserves stress capital buffer scb requirement which is set through ccar stress testing on january the federal reserve finalized regulatory amendments related to the scb requirements for category iv banking organizations to be consistent with the tailoring rules the scb reflects losses under the severely adverse scenario of the ccar supervisory stress tests the federal reserve calculates a scb as the greater of i the difference between the firms starting and minimum projected common equity tier cet1 riskbased capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario in the supervisory stress test plus the sum of dollar amount of the firms planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon as a percentage of riskweighted assets or ii percent the scb calculated by the federal reserve replaces the static percent capital conservation buffer required by basel iii as noted above the ccar supervisory stress tests are distinct from dfast and bancshares will not be subject to dfast requirements until it has billion or more in total consolidated assets pursuant to the egrrcpa source of strength under the doddfrank act bank holding companies are required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks under this requirement the parent company is expected to commit resources to support fcb including times when the parent company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources any capital loans made by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks in the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment safety and soundness the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards these guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems internal audit systems loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate exposure asset growth and compensation fees and benefits in general the guidelines require among other things appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines there are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential loss to the depositors of such depository institutions and to the fdic insurance fund in the event of a depository institution default as noted above bancshares became a category iv banking organization and is subject to enhanced prudential standards and enhanced supervision under the tailoring rules subject to the applicable transition periods limits on dividends and other payments the parent company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries revenues of the parent company primarily result from dividends received from fcb there are various legal limitations applicable to the payment of dividends by fcb to the parent company and to the payment of dividends by the parent company to its stockholders the payment of dividends by fcb or the parent company may be limited by certain factors such as requirements to maintain capital above regulatory guidelines bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit fcb or the parent company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting their business the payment of dividends depending on the financial condition of fcb or the parent company could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice bancshares became a category iv banking organization and is required to submit a capital plan annually to the federal reserve in accordance with the applicable transition provisions the annual capital plan will include planned capital distributions over a specified forecasting horizon bancshares is subject to biennial supervisory capital stress testing under the federal reserves ccar process the scb would replace the static component of the capital conservation buffer with a capital buffer that is based on supervisory stress test results and the parent companys planned capital distributions as discussed above bancshares scb would be calculated as the greater of i the difference between bancshares starting and minimum projected cet1 capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the supervisory stress test plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends as a percentage of riskweighted assets and ii percent bancshares supervisory stress testing results under ccar could impact the ability of the parent company to declare dividends or make other capital distributions including common share repurchases additionally under the fdi act idis such as fcb are prohibited from making capital distributions including the payment of dividends if after making such distributions the institution would become undercapitalized as such term is used in the statute additionally under basel iii capital guidelines banking institutions with a regulatory capital ratio above the basel iii minimum but below the basel iii requirement will face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall based on fcbs current financial condition the parent company currently does not expect these provisions to have any material impact on its ability to receive dividends from fcb the parent companys nonbank subsidiaries pay dividends to the parent company periodically on a nonregulated basis cryptoasset related activities on august the frb released supervisory guidance sr encouraging all banking organizations supervised by the agency to notify its lead supervisory point of contact at the federal reserve prior to engaging in any cryptoasset related activity prior to engaging in any such activities the banking organization is expected to ensure that the activities are legally permissible under relevant state and federal

minimum of the increased assessment rate schedules will remain in effect until the reserve ratio meets or exceeds percent absent further action by the fdic capital requirements the basel iii and pca wellcapitalized thresholds for the regulatory capital ratios are described above in the parent company capital requirements discussion failure to meet regulatory capital requirements may result in

and other consumer financial products and services the cfpb is responsible for interpreting and enforcing federal consumer financial laws as defined by the doddfrank act that among other things govern the provision of deposit accounts along with mortgage origination and servicing some federal consumer financial laws enforced by the cfpb include the equal credit opportunity act tila the truth in savings act the home mortgage disclosure act the real estate settlement procedures act respa the fair debt collection practices act and the fair credit reporting act the cfpb is also authorized to prevent any institution under its authority from engaging in an unfair deceptive or abusive act or practice in connection with consumer financial products and services under tila as implemented by regulation z mortgage lenders are required to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms mortgage lenders are required to determine consumers ability to repay in one of two ways the first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision current or reasonably expected income or assets current employment status the monthly payment on the covered transaction the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan the monthly payment for mortgagerelated obligations current debt obligations alimony and child support the monthly dti ratio or residual income and credit history alternatively the mortgage lender can originate qms which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the atr requirements in general a qm is a mortgage loan without negative amortization interestonly payments balloon payments or terms exceeding years in addition to be a qm the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed of the total loan amount on december the cfpb issued two final rules related to qm loans the first rule replaces the strict dti threshold for qm loans and provides that in addition to existing requirements a loan receives a conclusive presumption that the consumer had the ability to repay if the apr does not exceed the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction by percentage points or more as of the date the interest rate is set further a loan receives a rebuttable presumption that the consumer had the ability to repay if the apr exceeds the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction by percentage points or more but by less than percentage points the second rule creates a new category of seasoned qms for loans that meet certain performance requirements that rule allows a nonqm loan or a rebuttable presumption qm loan to receive a safe harbor from atr liability at the end of a seasoning period of at least months as a seasoned qm if it satisfies certain product restrictions pointsandfees limits and underwriting requirements and the loan meets the designated performance and portfolio requirements during the seasoning period the mandatory compliance date under the first final rule was july but subsequently was delayed by the cfpb to october the second final rule will apply to covered transactions for which institutions receive an application after the compliance date for the first final rule additionally the cfpb has the authority to take supervisory and enforcement action against banks and other financial services companies under the agencys jurisdiction that fail to comply with federal consumer financial laws as an idi with total assets of more than billion fcb is subject to the cfpbs supervisory and enforcement authorities the doddfrank act also permits states to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and state attorneys general to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the cfpb as a result of these aspects of the doddfrank act fcb operates in a stringent consumer compliance environment the cfpb has been active in bringing enforcement actions against banks and other financial institutions to enforce consumer financial laws the federal financial regulatory agencies including the fdic and states attorneys general also have become increasingly active in this area with respect to institutions over which they have jurisdiction pursuant to the doddfrank act the fdic has backup enforcement authority over a depository institution holding company such as the parent company if the conduct or threatened conduct of such holding company poses a risk to the dif although such authority may not be used if the holding company is generally in sound condition and does not pose a foreseeable and material risk to the dif the doddfrank act may have a material impact on bancshares operations particularly through increased compliance costs resulting from possible future consumer and fair lending regulations refer to item risk factors below for a more extensive discussion of this topic other regulations applicable to the parent company and fcb privacy data protection and cybersecurity we are subject to a number of us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer privacy and data protection under privacy protection provisions of the grammleachbliley act of glba and its implementing regulations and guidance we are limited in our ability to disclose certain nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties financial institutions such as us are required by statute and regulation to notify consumers of their privacy policies and practices and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party in addition such financial institutions must appropriately safeguard their customers nonpublic personal information consumers must be notified in the event of a data breach under applicable state laws the changing privacy laws in the united states europe and elsewhere including the california consumer privacy act of the ccpa which became effective on january applies to forprofit businesses that conduct business in california and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds the ccpa gives consumers the right to request disclosure of information collected about them and whether that information has been sold or shared with others the right to request deletion of personal information subject to certain exceptions the right to opt out of the sale of the consumers personal information and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights the ccpa contains several exemptions including for information that is collected processed sold or disclosed pursuant to the glba in november voters in the state of california approved the california privacy rights act cpra a ballot measure that amends and supplements the ccpa by creating the california privacy protection agency a watchdog privacy agency with the authority to issue regulations and guidance and to enforce the ccpa the cpra also modifies the ccpa by expanding both the scope of businesses covered by the law and certain rights relating to personal information and its use collection and disclosure by covered businesses the california privacy protection agency has issued proposed rules which would implement the cpra but has not yet made them final or stated when final rules are likely to be enacted similar laws have and may be adopted by other states where bancshares does business for instance on october the new york state department of financial services issued a proposed rule that would among other things amend its cybersecurity regulation to create new tiers of regulated entities with tailored regulatory requirements establish enhanced governance requirements and require additional cybersecurity controls in addition multiple other states congress and regulators outside the united states are considering similar laws or regulations which could create new individual privacy rights and impose increased obligations on companies handling personal data for example on november the federal financial regulatory agencies published a final rule that will impose upon banking organizations and their service providers new notification requirements for significant cybersecurity incidents the cybersecurity rule specifically the cybersecurity rule requires banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulator as soon as possible and no later than hours after the discovery of a computersecurity incident that rises to the level of a notification incident within the meaning attributed to those terms by the cybersecurity rule banks service providers are required under the cybersecurity rule to notify any affected bank to or on behalf of which the service provider provides services as soon as possible after determining that it has experienced an incident that materially disrupts or degrades or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade covered services provided to such bank for as much as four hours the cybersecurity rule took effect on april and banks and their service providers were required to be in compliance with the rule by may federal banking agencies including the fdic have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and cybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of the board of directors these guidelines along with related regulatory materials increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the provision of financial services climaterelated regulation and risk management in recent years the federal banking agencies have increased their focus on climaterelated risks impacting the operations of banks the communities they serve and the broader financial system accordingly the agencies have begun to enhance their supervisory expectations regarding the climate risk management practices of larger banking organizations such as bancshares including by encouraging such banks to ensure that management of climaterelated risk exposures has been incorporated into existing governance structures evaluate the potential impact of climaterelated risks on the banks financial condition operations and business objectives as part of its strategic planning process account for the effects of climate change in stress testing scenarios and systemic risk assessments revise expectations for credit portfolio concentrations based on climaterelated factors consider investments in climaterelated initiatives and lending to communities disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change evaluate the impact of climate change on the banks borrowers and consider possible changes to underwriting criteria to account for climaterelated risks to mortgaged properties incorporate climaterelated financial risk into the banks internal reporting monitoring and escalation processes and prepare for the transition risks to the bank associated with the adjustment to a lowcarbon economy and related changes in laws regulations governmental policies technology and consumer behavior and expectations on october the financial stability oversight council published a report identifying climaterelated financial risk as an emerging threat to financial stability on december the occ issued proposed principles for climaterelated financial risk management for national banks with more than billion in total assets on march and december the fdic and frb issued their own proposed principles respectively for climate risk management by larger banking organizations the regulators have also indicated that all banks regardless of their size may have material exposures to climaterelated financial and other risks that require prudent management the frb as the last agency to issue proposed guidance indicated that it will work with the other two agencies in issuing any final guidance the proposed principles in the guidance would cover the following areas strategic planning governance policies procedures and limits data risk measurement and reporting risk management and scenario analysis the proposed guidance would also suggest how climaterelated financial risks can be addressed in specific prudential risk areas including liquidity credit other financial risks operational legal and compliance and other nonfinancial risks if adopted as final guidance bancshares as a banking organization with billion or more in total assets will be expected to implement the principles under the guidance to demonstrate to the frb and the fdic that bancshares and fcb are operating in a safe and sound manner in addition states in which we conduct business have taken or are considering taking similar actions on climaterelated financial risks compensation our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the federal reserve and with respect to some of our subsidiaries by other financial regulatory agencies the federal banking regulators have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations take into account risk factors and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization the guidance also provides that supervisory findings with respect to incentive compensation will be incorporated into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or other corporate decisions the guidance further provides that the regulators may pursue enforcement actions against a banking organization if its incentive compensation and related risk management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safe and sound practices in addition the doddfrank act requires the federal banking regulators and the sec to issue regulations requiring covered financial institutions to prohibit incentive compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing compensation that is excessive or that could lead to material financial loss to the institution in october the sec adopted final rules implementing the incentivebased compensation recovery clawback provisions of the doddfrank act the final rules direct stock exchanges to require listed companies to implement clawback policies to recover incentivebased compensation from current or former executive officers in the event of certain financial restatements and to disclose their clawback policies and their actions under those policies it is anticipated that most registrants will have until late or early to adopt and implement or adjust their policies as applicable other
