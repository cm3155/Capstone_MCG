item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk risk management risk is inherent in any business bancshares has defined a moderate risk appetite a balanced approach to risk taking with a philosophy which does not preclude higher risk business activities balanced with acceptable returns while meeting regulatory objectives through the comprehensive risk management framework and risk appetite framework senior management has primary responsibility for daytoday management of the risks we face with accountability of and support from all associates senior management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which bancshares may be exposed with effective challenge and oversight by management committees in addition our board of directors the board strives to ensure the business culture is integrated with the risk management program and policies procedures and metrics for identifying assessing monitoring and managing risk are part of the decisionmaking process the boards role in risk oversight is an integral part of our overall risk management framework and risk appetite framework the board administers its risk oversight function primarily through the board risk committee the board risk committee structure is designed to allow for information flow effective challenge and timely escalation of riskrelated issues the board risk committee is directed to monitor and advise the full board regarding risk exposures including credit market capital liquidity operational compliance asset strategic and reputational risks review approve and monitor adherence to the risk appetite statement and supporting risk tolerance levels via a series of established metrics and evaluate monitor and oversee the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management framework and risk appetite framework the board risk committee also reviews reports of examination by and communications from regulatory agencies the results of internal and third party testing and qualitative and quantitative assessments related to risk management and any other matters within the scope of the board risk committees oversight responsibilities the board risk committee monitors managements response to certain riskrelated regulatory and audit issues in addition the board risk committee may coordinate with the audit committee and the compensation nominations and governance committee for the review of financial statements and related risks compensation risk management and other areas of joint responsibility in combination with other risk management and monitoring practices enterprisewide stress testing activities are part of the risk management framework and conducted within a defined framework stress tests are performed for various risks to ensure the financial institution can support continued operations during stressed periods enactment of the egrrcpa significantly altered several provisions of the doddfrank act including how stress tests are run bancshares will continue to monitor and stress test its capital and liquidity consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators refer to the regulatory considerations section of item business included in this annual report on form 10k for further discussion credit risk management credit risk is the risk of not collecting payments pursuant to the contractual terms of loans leases and certain investment securities loans and leases we originate are underwritten in accordance with our credit policies and procedures and are subject to periodic ongoing reviews acquired loans regardless of whether pcd or nonpcd are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date and are subject to periodic reviews to identify any further credit deterioration our independent credit review function conducts risk reviews and analyses of both originated and acquired loans to ensure compliance with credit policies and to monitor asset quality trends and borrower financial strength these reviews include portfolio analysis by geographic location industry collateral type and product we strive to identify potential problem loans as early as possible to record chargeoffs or writedowns as appropriate and to maintain an appropriate acl that accounts for expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio our acl estimate as of december included extensive reviews of the changes in credit risk associated with the uncertainties around economic forecasts and the overall economic impact of covid19 expected loss estimates within each portfolio considered the potential impact of economic activity as well as potential mitigating impact from the government stimulus and loan modification programs these loss estimates additionally considered bancshares industry risk historically strong credit quality and actual net losses incurred during prior periods of economic stress as well as recent credit trends which have not seen significant deterioration as of december we maintain a welldiversified loan and lease portfolio and seek to minimize the risks associated with large concentrations within specific geographic areas collateral types or industries despite our focus on diversification several characteristics of our loan portfolio subject us to significant risk such as our concentrations of real estate secured loans revolving mortgage loans and medical and dentalrelated loans we have historically carried a significant concentration of real estate secured loans but actively mitigate exposure through underwriting policies which primarily rely on borrower cash flow rather than underlying collateral values when we do rely on underlying real property values we favor financing secured by owneroccupied real property and as a result a large percentage of our real estate secured loans are owner occupied at december loans secured by real estate were billion or of total loans and leases compared to billion or at december and billion or at december similar to our branch footprint the collateral of loans secured by real estate is concentrated within north carolina and south carolina at december real estate located in north carolina and

estate collateral table start december collateral location percent of real estate secured loans with collateral located in the state north carolina south carolina california florida georgia virginia washington texas tennessee all other locations table end among real estate secured loans our revolving mortgage loans home equity lines of credit or helocs present a heightened risk due to long commitment periods during which the financial position of individual borrowers or collateral values may deteriorate significantly in addition a large percentage of our helocs are secured by junior liens substantial declines in collateral values could cause junior lien positions to become effectively unsecured helocs secured by real estate were billion or of total loans at december compared to billion or at december and billion or at december except for loans acquired through mergers and acquisitions we have not purchased helocs in the secondary market nor have we originated these loans to customers outside of our market areas all originated helocs were underwritten by us based on our standard lending criteria the heloc portfolio consists of variable rate lines of credit which allow customer draws during a specified period of the line of credit with a portion switching to an amortizing term following the draw period approximately of the revolving mortgage portfolio relates to properties in north carolina and south carolina approximately of the loan balances outstanding are secured by senior collateral positions while the remaining are secured by junior liens we actively monitor the portion of our helocs in the interestonly period and when they will mature approximately of outstanding balances at december require interestonly payments while the remaining require monthly payments equal to the greater of of the outstanding balance or when helocs switch from interestonly to fully amortizing including principal and interest some borrowers may not be able to afford the higher monthly payments we have not experienced a significant increase in defaults as a result of these increased payments in the normal course of business we will work with each borrower as they approach the revolving period maturity date to discuss options for refinance or repayment loans and leases to borrowers in medical dental or related fields were billion as of december which represents of total loans and leases compared to billion or of total loans and leases at december and billion or of total loans and leases at december the credit risk of this industry concentration is mitigated through our underwriting policies which emphasize reliance on adequate borrower cash flow rather than underlying collateral value and our preference for financing secured by owneroccupied real property except for this single concentration no other industry represented more than of total loans and leases outstanding at december interest rate risk management interest rate risk irr results principally from assets and liabilities maturing or repricing at different points in time assets and liabilities repricing at the same point in time but in different amounts and shortterm and longterm interest rates changing in different magnitudes we assess our shortterm irr by forecasting net interest income over months under various interest rate scenarios and comparing those results to forecasted net interest income assuming stable rates irr scenarios modeled include but are not limited to immediate parallel rate shocks interest rate ramps changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in the relationships of our rates to market rates the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities generally results in a net assetsensitive position concentrated in the middle of the yield curve mostly driven by moves in the federal funds rate whereby our assets will reprice faster than our liabilities interest rate sensitive assets generally consist of interestbearing cash investment securities and commercial and consumer loans approximately of our commercial and consumer loans have floating contractual reference rates these floating rate loans are indexed to the following rates with approximate percentages of each floating rate loan portfolio relative to the total floating rate loan portfolio included in parenthesis prime libor secured

net income sensitivity simulation analysis table start estimated decrease increase in net interest income change in interest rate basis points december december table end net interest income sensitivity metrics at december remain largely unchanged when compared to december longterm interest rate risk exposure is measured using the economic value of equity eve sensitivity analysis to study the impact of longterm cash flows on earnings and capital eve represents the difference between the sum of the present value of all asset cash flows and the sum of the present value of the liability cash flows eve sensitivity analysis involves discounting cash flows under different interest rate scenarios the basecase measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow management to measure longerterm repricing and option risk in the balance sheet table presents the eve profile as of december and table economic value of equity modeling analysis table start estimated decrease increase in eve change in interest rate basis points december december table end the eve metrics at december compared to december were primarily affected by ongoing growth in nonmaturity deposits during coupled with the interest rate environment we do not typically utilize interest rate swaps floors collars or other derivative financial instruments to attempt to hedge our overall balance sheet rate sensitivity and interest rate risk our simulations do not account for other business developments including the cit merger that could affect net interest income and eve or for management actions that could affect net interest income and eve or that could be taken to change our risk profile accordingly we can give no assurance that actual results would not differ materially from the estimated

loans total loans and leases table end liquidity risk management liquidity risk is the risk an institution is unable to generate or obtain sufficient cash or its equivalents on a costeffective basis to meet commitments as they fall due the most common sources of liquidity risk arise from mismatches in the timing and value of onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet cash inflows and outflows in general onbalance sheet mismatches generate liquidity risk when the effective maturity of assets exceeds the effective maturity of liabilities a commonly cited example of a balance sheet liquidity mismatch is when longterm loans assets are funded with shortterm borrowings liabilities other forms of liquidity risk include market constraints on the ability to convert assets into cash at expected levels an inability to access funding sources at sufficient levels at a reasonable cost and changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit market operational legal and reputation risks affecting an institutions liquidity risk profile we utilize various limitbased measures to monitor measure and control liquidity risk across three different types of liquidity tactical measures the risk of a negative cash flow position whereby cash outflows exceed cash inflows over a shortterm horizon out to nine weeks structural measures the amount by which illiquid assets are supported by longterm funding and contingent measures the risk of having insufficient liquidity sources to support cash needs under potential future stressed market conditions or having an inability to access wholesale funding sources in a timely and cost effective manner we aim to maintain a diverse mix of liquidity sources to support the liquidity management function while aiming to avoid funding concentrations by diversifying our external funding with respect to maturities counterparties and nature our primary source of liquidity is our branchgenerated deposit portfolio due to the generally stable balances and low cost additional sources include cash at the federal reserve bank and various other correspondent bank accounts and unencumbered securities which totaled billion at december compared to billion at december another source of available funds is advances from the fhlb of atlanta outstanding fhlb advances were million as of december and we had sufficient collateral pledged to secure billion of additional borrowings further in the current year billion in nonpcd loans with a lendable collateral value of billion were used to create additional borrowing capacity at the federal reserve bank we also maintain federal funds and other credit lines which had million of available capacity at december fourth quarter analysis for the quarter ended december net income was million compared to million for the corresponding quarter of a decrease of million or the decrease was primarily the result of lower net interest income lower noninterest income and higher noninterest expenses partially offset by lower provision expense earnings per share were for the fourth quarter of compared to for the same period a year ago net interest income was million a decrease of million or compared to the fourth quarter of this was primarily due to a decline in the yield on loans and a decrease in interest and fee income on sbappp loans largely offset by organic loan growth higher investment and overnight balances and yields as well as lower rates on interestbearing deposits sbappp loans contributed million in interest and fee income for the fourth quarter of compared to million for the same quarter in the taxableequivalent net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was a decrease of basis points from in the same quarter in the prior year the margin decline was primarily due to changes in earning asset mix driven by excess liquidity and higher balances in overnight investments a decline in the yield on loans and lower income on sbappp loans these declines were partially offset by lower rates paid on interestbearing deposits and higher investment yields income tax expense was million in the fourth quarter of compared to million in the fourth quarter of the effective tax rates were and during each of these respective periods provision for credit losses was a net benefit of million during the fourth quarter of compared to million in expense for the fourth quarter of the million decrease was favorably impacted by a million reserve release driven primarily by continued strong credit performance low net chargeoffs and improvement in macroeconomic factors the net recovery ratio was for the fourth quarter of compared to for the fourth quarter of noninterest income was million for the fourth quarter of a decrease of million from the same period of contributing to the decline was a million reduction in fair market value adjustments on marketable equity securities a million decrease in mortgage income due to reductions in gain on sale and production volume driven by higher mortgage rates and increased competition and a million decline in realized gains on available for sale securities these declines were partially offset by a million increase in wealth management services due to growth in assets under management resulting in higher advisory and transaction fees a million increase in service charges on deposit accounts a million increase in cardholder services net and a million increase in both merchant services net and other service charges and fees noninterest expense was million for the fourth quarter of an increase of million from the same quarter last year this was primarily due to increases of million in salaries and wages resulting from annual merit and higher revenuebased incentives million in cit mergerrelated expenses million in processing fees paid to third parties resulting from our continued investments in digital and technology to support revenuegenerating businesses and improve internal processes and temporary personnel costs
