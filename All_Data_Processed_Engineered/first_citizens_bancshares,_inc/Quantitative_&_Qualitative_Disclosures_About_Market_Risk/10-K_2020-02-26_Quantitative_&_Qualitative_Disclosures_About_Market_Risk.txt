item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk risk management risk is inherent in any business bancshares has defined a moderate risk appetite a conservative approach to risk taking with a philosophy which does not preclude higher risk business activities balanced with acceptable returns while meeting regulatory objectives through the comprehensive enterprise risk management framework and risk appetite framework senior management has primary responsibility for daytoday management of the risks we face with accountability of and support from all associates senior management applies various strategies to reduce the risks to which bancshares may be exposed with effective challenge and oversight by management committees in addition the board strives to ensure the business culture is integrated with the enterprise risk management program and policies procedures and metrics for identifying assessing monitoring and managing risk are part of the decisionmaking process the boards role in risk oversight is an integral part of our overall enterprise risk management framework and risk appetite framework the board administers its risk oversight function primarily through the board risk committee the board risk committee structure is designed to allow for information flow effective challenge and timely escalation of riskrelated issues the board risk committee is directed to monitor and advise the board of directors regarding risk exposures including credit market capital liquidity operational compliance strategic and reputational risks review approve and monitor adherence to the risk appetite statement and supporting risk tolerance levels via a series of established metrics and evaluate monitor and oversee the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management framework and risk appetite framework the board risk committee also reviews reports of examination by and communications from regulatory agencies the results of internal and third party testing and qualitative and quantitative assessments related to risk management and any other matters within the scope of the committees oversight responsibilities the board risk committee monitors managements response to certain riskrelated regulatory and audit issues in addition the board risk committee may coordinate with the audit committee and the compensation nominations and governance committee for the review of financial statements and related risks information security and other areas of joint responsibility in combination with other risk management and monitoring practices enterprisewide stress testing activities are part of the risk management framework and conducted within a defined framework stress tests are performed for various risks to ensure the financial institution can support continued operations during stressed periods enactment of the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act in may significantly altered several provisions of the doddfrank act including how stress tests are run bank holding companies with assets of less than billion such as bancshares are no longer subject to companyrun stress testing requirements in section 165i2 of the doddfrank act including publishing a summary of results however bancshares will continue to monitor and stress test its capital and liquidity consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators credit risk management credit risk is the risk of not collecting payments pursuant to the contractual terms of loans leases and certain investment securities loans and leases we originate are underwritten in accordance with our credit policies and procedures and are subject to periodic ongoing reviews acquired loans regardless of whether pci or nonpci are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date and are subject to periodic reviews to identify any further credit deterioration our independent credit review function conducts risk reviews and analyses of both originated and acquired loans to ensure compliance with credit policies and to monitor asset quality trends and borrower financial strength these reviews include portfolio analysis by geographic location industry collateral type and product we strive to identify potential problem loans as early as possible to record chargeoffs or writedowns as appropriate and to maintain an adequate alll which accounts for losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio we maintain a welldiversified loan and lease portfolio and seek to minimize the risks associated with large concentrations within specific geographic areas collateral types or industries despite our focus on diversification several characteristics of our loan portfolio subject us to significant risk such as our concentrations of real estate secured loans revolving mortgage loans and medical and dentalrelated loans we have historically carried a significant concentration of real estate secured loans but actively mitigate exposure through underwriting policies which primarily rely on borrower cash flow rather than underlying collateral values when we do rely on underlying real property values we favor financing secured by owneroccupied real property and as a result a large percentage of our real estate secured loans are owner occupied at december loans secured by real estate were billion or of total loans and leases compared to billion or at december and billion or at december similar to our branch footprint the collateral of loans secured by real estate is concentrated within north carolina and south carolina at december real estate located in north carolina and south carolina represented and respectively of all real estate used as collateral table provides the geographic

located in the state north carolina south carolina california florida georgia virginia washington texas tennessee all other locations table end among real estate secured loans our revolving mortgage loans home equity lines of credit or helocs present a heightened risk due to long commitment periods during which the financial position of individual borrowers or collateral values may deteriorate significantly in addition a large percentage of our helocs are secured by junior liens substantial declines in collateral values could cause junior lien positions to become effectively unsecured helocs secured by real estate were billion or of total loans at december compared to billion or at december and billion or at december except for loans acquired through mergers and acquisitions we have not purchased helocs in the secondary market nor have we originated these loans to customers outside of our market areas all originated helocs were underwritten by us based on our standard lending criteria the heloc portfolio consists of variable rate lines of credit which allow customer draws during a specified period of the line of credit with a portion switching to an amortizing term following the draw period approximately of the revolving mortgage portfolio relates to properties in north carolina and south carolina approximately of the loan balances outstanding are secured by senior collateral positions while the remaining are secured by junior liens we actively monitor the portion of our helocs in the interestonly period and when they will mature approximately of outstanding balances at december require interestonly payments while the remaining require monthly payments equal to the greater of of the outstanding balance or when helocs switch from interestonly to fully amortizing including principal and interest some borrowers may not be able to afford the higher monthly payments we have not experienced a significant increase in defaults as a result of these increased payments in the normal course of business the bank will work with each borrower as they approach the revolving period maturity date to discuss options for refinance or repayment loans and leases to borrowers in medical dental or related fields were billion as of december which represents of total loans and leases compared to billion or of total loans and leases at december and billion or of total loans and leases at december the credit risk of this industry concentration is mitigated through our underwriting policies which emphasize reliance on adequate borrower cash flow rather than underlying collateral value and our preference for financing secured by owneroccupied real property except for this single concentration no other industry represented more than of total loans and leases outstanding at december interest rate risk management interest rate risk irr results principally from assets and liabilities maturing or repricing at different points in time assets and liabilities repricing at the same point in time but in different amounts and shortterm and longterm interest rates changing in different magnitudes we assess our shortterm irr by forecasting net interest income over months under various interest rate scenarios and comparing those results to forecasted net interest income assuming stable rates irr scenarios modeled include but are not limited to immediate parallel rate shocks interest rate ramps changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in the relationships of our rates to market rates table provides the impact on net interest income over months resulting from various instantaneous interest rate shock scenarios as of december and table net interest income sensitivity simulation anaylysis table start estimated decrease increase in net interest income change in interest rate basis points december december table end net interest income sensitivity metrics at december compared to december were primarily affected by a reduction in the prepayment speed forecast for the loan portfolio due to rising market interest rates during the fourth quarter of this reduced the amount of principal available for repricing during moderate rising interest rate shocks conversely the same protects interest income during down rate shocks longterm interest rate risk exposure is measured using the economic value of equity eve sensitivity analysis to study the impact of longterm cash flows on earnings and capital eve represents the difference between the sum of the present value of all asset cash flows and the sum of the present value of the liability cash flows eve sensitivity analysis involves discounting cash flows under different interest rate scenarios the basecase measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow management to measure longerterm repricing and option risk in the balance sheet table presents the eve profile as of december and table economic value of equity modeling analysis table start estimated decrease increase in eve change in interest rate basis points december december table end the economic value of equity metrics at december compared to december saw declines when measured against moderate rising rate shocks due to several factors declining market interest rates relative to levels during the fourth quarter of generally allowed for an improvement in the valuation of the loan portfolio however a modest increase in the exposure to fixed rate loans both organically and through acquisition led to a decline in eve metrics additionally a reduction in shortterm us treasury holdings and a comparable increase in agency mortgagebacked securities which enhanced yield and earnings as well as increased overall portfolio duration resulting in a further decline in eve metrics we do not typically utilize interest rate swaps floors collars or other derivative financial instruments to attempt to hedge our overall balance sheet rate sensitivity and

total loans and leases loans maturing after one year with fixed interest rates floating or adjustable rates total table end liquidity risk management liquidity risk is the risk an institution is unable to generate or obtain sufficient cash or its equivalents on a costeffective basis to meet commitments as they fall due the most common sources of liquidity risk arise from mismatches in the timing and value of onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet cash inflows and outflows in general onbalance sheet mismatches generate liquidity risk when the effective maturity of assets exceeds the effective maturity of liabilities a commonly cited example of a balance sheet liquidity mismatch is when longterm loans assets are funded with shortterm borrowings liabilities other forms of liquidity risk include market constraints on the ability to convert assets into cash at expected levels an inability to access funding sources at sufficient levels at a reasonable cost and changes in economic conditions or exposure to credit market operational legal and reputation risks affecting an institutions liquidity risk profile we utilize various limitbased measures to monitor measure and control liquidity risk across three different types of liquidity table start tactical measures the risk of a negative cash flow position whereby cash outflows exceed cash inflows over a shortterm horizon out to nine weeks table endtable start structural measures the amount by which illiquid assets are supported by longterm funding and table endtable start contingent measures the risk of having insufficient liquidity sources to support cash needs under potential future stressed market conditions or having an inability to access wholesale funding sources in a timely and cost effective manner table end we aim to maintain a diverse mix of liquidity sources to support the liquidity management function while aiming to avoid funding concentrations by diversifying our external funding with respect to maturities counterparties and nature our primary source of liquidity is our retail deposit book due to the generally stable balances and low cost it offers additional sources include cash in excess of our reserve requirement at the federal reserve bank and various other correspondent bank accounts and unencumbered securities which totaled billion at december compared to billion at december another source of available funds is advances from the fhlb of atlanta outstanding fhlb advances were million as of december and we had sufficient collateral pledged to secure billion of additional borrowings further in the current year billion in nonpci loans with a lendable collateral value of billion were used to create additional borrowing capacity at the federal reserve bank we also maintain federal funds and other credit lines which had million of available capacity at december fourth quarter analysis for the quarter ended december bancshares consolidated net income was million compared to million for the corresponding quarter of an increase of million or earnings per share were for the fourth quarter of compared to for the same period a year ago the increase was primarily the result of higher interest income higher noninterest income lower provision expense and fewer shares outstanding due to share repurchases these net income improvements were partially offset by higher interest noninterest and income tax expenses net interest income totaled million an increase of million or compared to the fourth quarter of the increase was primarily due to higher loan interest income of million as a result of originated and acquired loan growth this favorable impact was partially offset by an increase in interest expense on deposits of million as a result of higher rates paid the taxableequivalent net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was a decrease of basis points from in the same quarter in the prior year the margin decline was primarily due to higher interest expense on deposits as well as lower loan yields income tax expense totaled million in the fourth quarter of up from million in the fourth quarter of the effective tax rates were and during each of these respective periods the increase in income tax expense was primarily a result of higher gross earnings bancshares recorded a net provision expense of million for loan and lease losses during the fourth quarter of compared to million for the fourth quarter of the million decrease was primarily driven by changes in portfolio mix and continued strong credit quality noninterest income was million for the fourth quarter of an increase of million from the same period of the increase was primarily driven by a million increase in marketable equity securities gains as well as a million increase in mortgage income these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in cardholder and merchant services income noninterest expense was million for the fourth quarter of an increase of million from the same quarter last year largely due to an increase in personnel expenses primarily related to merit increases as well as personnel additions from acquisitions along with a million increase in mergerrelated expenses these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in collection and foreclosurerelated expenses and a million decrease in consulting expenses

historical loss rates for each loan class by credit quality indicator and may be adjusted through a qualitative assessment to reflect current economic conditions and portfolio trends the models utilized by management in determining the alll are highly complex with various key inputs and assumptions judgment is required to determine the inputs and assumptions used and these can significantly impact the provision recognized the most significant judgments include the loss rates which comprise the length of the historical chargeoff period used estimates of the probability of default losses incurred given default and loss emergence period applied as well as qualitative reserves relating to changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio overall there is a significant judgment required by management in developing these models the alll represents a significant critical accounting estimate and managements estimation of probable credit losses within the loan and lease portfolio at the balance sheet date the amount of the allowance is based on managements evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio including the nature of the loan portfolio credit concentrations adequacy of collateral debt service capacity trends in historical loss experience economic conditions and specific impaired loans the principal considerations for our determination of the alll as a critical audit matter are the complexity and subjectivity of the estimates and assumptions that management utilized in determining the loss rates and qualitative factors particularly the nature and volume of the portfolio this required a high degree of judgment in selecting the auditor procedures to evaluate managements estimate and assumptions as it relates to the alll the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included table start we tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to managements determination of the alll including controls over the allowance models and the inputs utilized to support the reserve calculations controls tested around the model include review of the model calculations and analysis by management monitoring over key performance indicators and other ratios as well as the evaluation of factors impacting the qualitative assessment such as changes in the factor related to the nature and volume of the portfolio additionally we tested controls around the appropriateness of the loan grading policy and the consistency of application including risk grade changes as it relates to the loss factors and calculation

are originated or purchased and if purchased whether or not the loans reflect credit deterioration at the date of acquisition nonpurchased credit impaired nonpci loans nonpci loans consist of loans originated by bancshares or loans purchased from other institutions that do not reflect credit deterioration at acquisition originated loans for which management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as held for investment and carried at the principal amount outstanding net of any unearned income chargeoffs and unamortized fees and costs nonrefundable fees collected and certain direct costs incurred related to loan originations are deferred and recorded as an adjustment to loans outstanding the net amount of the nonrefundable fees and costs is amortized to interest income over the contractual lives using methods that approximate a constant yield purchased loans which do not reflect credit deterioration at acquisition are classified as nonpci loans these loans are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition the difference between the fair value and the unpaid principal balance at the acquisition date is amortized or accreted to interest income over the contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method purchased credit impaired pci loans purchased loans which reflect credit deterioration since origination such that it is probable at acquisition that bancshares will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are classified as pci loans pci loans are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition if the timing and amount of the future cash flows can be reasonably estimated any excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value are recognized as interest income over the life of the loans using the effective yield method subsequent to the acquisition date increases in cash flows over those expected at the acquisition date are recognized prospectively as interest income decreases in expected cash flows due to credit deterioration are recognized by recording an allowance for loan losses in the event of prepayment the remaining unamortized amount is recognized in interest income to the extent possible pci loans are aggregated into pools based upon common risk characteristics and each pool is accounted for as a single unit the performance of all loans within the bancshares portfolio is subject to a number of external risks including changes in the overall health of the economy declines in real estate values changes in the demand for products and services and personal events such as death disability or change in marital status bancshares evaluates and reports its nonpci and pci loan portfolios separately and each portfolio is further divided into commercial and noncommercial segments based on the type of borrower purpose collateral andor our underlying credit management processes additionally commercial and noncommercial loans are assigned to loan classes which further disaggregate the loan portfolio nonpci commercial loans leases nonpci commercial loans excluding purchased nonimpaired loans are underwritten based primarily upon the customers ability to generate the required cash flow to service the debt in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions of the loan agreement additionally an understanding of the borrowers business including the experience and background of the principals is obtained prior to approval to the extent the loan is secured by collateral the likely value of the collateral and what level of strength the collateral brings to the transaction is also evaluated if the principals or other parties provide personal guarantees the relative financial strength and liquidity of each guarantor is also assessed acquired nonpci commercial loans are evaluated using comparable methods and procedures as those originated by bancshares construction and land development construction and land development consists of loans to finance land for development of commercial or residential real property and construction of multifamily apartments or other commercial properties these loans are highly dependent on the supply and demand for commercial real estate as well as the demand for newly constructed residential homes and lots acquired for development deterioration in demand could result in decreased collateral values which could make repayments of outstanding loans difficult for customers first citizens bancshares inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued commercial mortgage commercial mortgage consists of loans to purchase or refinance owneroccupied or investment nonresidential properties commercial mortgages secured by owneroccupied properties are primarily dependent on the ability of borrowers to achieve business results consistent with those projected at loan origination commercial mortgages secured by investment properties include office buildings and other facilities rented or leased to unrelated parties the primary risk associated with income producing commercial mortgage loans is the ability of the incomeproducing property that collateralizes the loan to produce adequate cash flow to service the debt while these loans and leases are collateralized by real property in an effort to mitigate risk it is possible the liquidation of collateral will not fully satisfy the obligation other commercial real estate other commercial real estate consists of loans secured by farmland including residential farms and other improvements and multifamily five or more residential properties the performance of agricultural loans is highly dependent on favorable weather reasonable costs for seed and fertilizer and the ability to successfully market the product at a profitable margin the demand for these products is also dependent on macroeconomic conditions beyond the control of the borrower the primary risk associated with multifamily loans is the ability of the incomeproducing property that collateralizes the loan to produce adequate cash flow to service the debt high unemployment or generally weak economic conditions may result in borrowers having to provide rental rate concessions to achieve adequate occupancy rates commercial and industrial and lease financing commercial and industrial and lease financing consists of loans or lines of credit to finance accounts receivable inventory or other general business needs business credit cards and lease financing agreements for equipment vehicles or other assets the primary risk associated with commercial and industrial and lease financing loans is the ability of borrowers to achieve business results consistent with those projected at origination failure to achieve these projections presents risk the borrower will be unable to service the debt consistent with the contractual terms of the loan or lease other other consists of all other commercial loans not classified in one of the preceding classes these typically include loans to nonprofit organizations such as churches hospitals educational and charitable organizations and certain loans repurchased with government guarantees nonpci noncommercial loans leases nonpci noncommercial loans excluding purchased nonimpaired loans are centrally underwritten using automated credit scoring and analysis tools these credit scoring tools take into account factors such as payment history credit utilization length of credit history types of credit currently in use and recent credit inquiries to the extent the loan is secured by collateral the likely value of such collateral is evaluated acquired nonpci noncommercial loans are evaluated using comparable methods and procedures as those originated by bancshares residential mortgage residential mortgage consists of loans to purchase or refinance the borrowers primary dwelling second residence or vacation home and are often secured by family residential property significant and rapid declines in real estate values can result in borrowers having debt levels in excess of the current market value of the collateral revolving mortgage revolving mortgage consists of home equity lines of credit secured by first or second liens on the borrowers primary residence these loans are often secured by second liens on the residential real estate and are particularly susceptible to declining collateral values as a substantial decline in value could render a second lien position effectively unsecured construction and land development construction and land development consists of loans to construct a borrowers primary or secondary residence or vacant land upon which the owner intends to construct a dwelling at a future date these loans are typically secured by undeveloped or partially developed land in anticipation of completing construction of a family residential property there is risk these construction and development projects can experience delays and cost overruns exceeding the borrowers financial ability to complete the project such cost overruns can result in foreclosure of partially completed and unmarketable collateral consumer consumer loans consist of installment loans to finance purchases of vehicles unsecured home improvements student loans and revolving lines of credit that can be secured or unsecured including personal credit cards the value of the underlying collateral within this class is at risk of potential rapid depreciation which could result in unpaid balances in excess of the collateral first citizens bancshares inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued pci loans the segments and classes utilized to evaluate and report pci loans is consistent with that of nonpci loans pci loans were underwritten by other institutions often with different lending standards and methods however the underwriting risks are generally consistent with the risks identified for nonpci loans additionally in some cases collateral for pci loans may be located in regions that previously experienced deterioration in real estate values and the underlying collateral may therefore not support full repayment of these loans nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructurings nonperforming assets npa npas include nonaccrual loans and foreclosed property foreclosed property consists of real estate and other assets acquired as a result of loan defaults and is discussed below all loans are classified as past due when the payment of principal and interest based upon contractual terms is greater than days delinquent nonpci loans are generally placed on nonaccrual when principal or interest becomes days past due or when it is probable the principal or interest is not fully collectible when nonpci loans are placed on nonaccrual all previously uncollected accrued interest is reversed from interest income and the ongoing accrual of interest is discontinued all payments received thereafter are applied as a reduction of the remaining principal balance as long as doubt exists as to the ultimate collection of the principal nonpci loans and leases are generally removed from nonaccrual status when they become current for a sustained period of time and there is no longer concern as to the collectability of principal and interest accretion of income for pci loans is discontinued when we are unable to estimate the amount or timing of cash flows pci loans may begin or resume accretion of income when information becomes available allowing us to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows the majority of pci loans are pooled for accounting purposes and therefore the npa status is determined based upon the aggregate performance of the pool troubled debt restructurings tdr a loan is considered a tdr when both of the following occur a modification to a borrowers debt agreement is made and a concession is granted for economic or legal reasons related to a borrowers financial difficulties that otherwise would not be granted tdr concessions could include shortterm deferrals of interest modifications of payment terms or in certain limited instances forgiveness of principal or interest loans restructured as a tdr are treated and reported as such for the remaining life of the loan modifications of pooled pci loans are not designated as tdrs whereas modifications of nonpooled pci loans are designated as tdrs in the same manner as nonpci loans tdr loans can be nonaccrual or accrual depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower in circumstances where a portion of the loan balance is chargedoff the remaining balance is typically classified as nonaccrual allowance for loan and lease losses alll the alll represents managements best estimate of inherent credit losses within the loan and lease portfolio at the balance sheet date management determines the alll based on an ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio estimates for loan losses are determined by analyzing quantitative and qualitative components such as economic conditions historical loan losses historical loan migration to chargeoff experience current trends in delinquencies and chargeoffs expected cash flows on pci loans current assessment of impaired loans and changes in the size composition andor risk within the loan portfolio adjustments to the alll are recorded with a corresponding entry to provision for loan and lease losses loan balances considered uncollectible are chargedoff against the alll recoveries of amounts previously chargedoff are generally credited to the alll a primary component of determining the allowance on nonpci loans collectively evaluated is the actual loss history of the various loan classes loan loss factors are based on historical experience and may be adjusted for significant factors that in managements judgment affect the collectability of principal and interest at the balance sheet date in accordance with our allowance methodology loan loss factors are monitored quarterly and may be adjusted based on changes in the level of historical net chargeoffs and updates by management such as the number of periods included in the calculation of loss factors loss severity loss emergence period and portfolio attrition for the nonpci commercial segment management incorporates historical net loss data to develop the applicable loan loss factors general reserves for collective impairment are based on incurred loss estimates for the loan class based on average loss rates by credit quality indicators which are estimated using historical loss experience and credit risk rating migrations credit quality indicators include borrower classification codes and facility risk ratings incurred loss estimates may be adjusted through a qualitative assessment to reflect current economic conditions and portfolio trends including credit quality concentrations aging of the portfolio and significant policy and underwriting changes first citizens bancshares inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued for the nonpci noncommercial segment management incorporates specific loan class and delinquency status trends into the loan loss factors general reserve estimates of incurred losses are based on historical loss experience and the migration of loans through the various delinquency pools applied to the current risk mix nonpci loans are considered to be impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that a borrower will be unable to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement generally management considers the following loans to be impaired all tdr loans and all loan relationships which are on nonaccrual or days past due and greater than nonpci impaired loans greater than are evaluated individually for impairment while others are evaluated collectively the impairment assessment and determination of the related specific reserve for each impaired loan is based on the loans characteristics impairment measurement for loans dependent on borrower cash flow for repayment is based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the interest rate implicit in the original loan agreement impairment measurement for most real estate loans particularly when a loan is considered to be a probable foreclosure is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral collateral is appraised and market value appropriately adjusted for an assessment of the sales and marketing costs is used to calculate a fair value estimate a specific valuation allowance is established or partial chargeoff is recorded for the difference between the excess recorded investment in the loan and the loans estimated fair value less costs to sell the alll for pci loans is estimated based on the expected cash flows over the life of the loan bancshares continues to estimate and update cash flows expected to be collected on individual loans or pools of loans sharing common risk characteristics bancshares compares the carrying value of all pci loans to the present value at each balance sheet date if the present value is less than the carrying value the shortfall reduces the remaining credit discount and if it is in excess of the remaining credit discount an alll is recorded through the recognition of provision expense the alll for pci loans with subsequent increases in expected cash flows to be collected is reduced and any remaining excess is recorded as an adjustment to the accretable yield over the loans or pools remaining life reserve for unfunded commitments the reserve for unfunded commitments represents the estimated probable losses related to standby letters of credit and other commitments to extend credit the reserve is calculated in a manner similar to the loans evaluated collectively for impairment while also considering the applicable regulatory capital credit conversion factors for these offbalance sheet instruments as well as the estimated exposure upon default the reserve for unfunded commitments is presented within other liabilities distinct from the alll and adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other noninterest expense and represent an immaterial balance other real estate owned oreo oreo includes foreclosed real estate property and closed branch properties and is initially recorded at the assets estimated fair value less cost to sell any excess in the recorded investment in the loan over the estimated fair value less costs to sell is chargedoff against the alll at the time of foreclosure if the estimated value of the oreo exceeds the recorded investment of the loan the difference is recorded as a gain within other income oreo is subsequently carried at the lower of cost or market value less estimated selling costs and is evaluated at least annually the periodic evaluations are generally based on the appraised value of the property and may include additional adjustments based upon managements review of the valuation estimate and specific knowledge of the

transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements the key difference between prior standards and this asu is the requirement for lessees to recognize all lease contracts on their balance sheet this asu requires lessees to classify leases as either operating or finance leases which are substantially similar to the previous operating and capital leases classifications the distinction between these two classifications under the new standard does not relate to balance sheet treatment but relates to treatment in the statements of income and cash flows lessor guidance remains largely unchanged with the exception of how a lessor determines the appropriate lease classification for each lease to better align the lessor guidance with revised lessee classification guidance we adopted this standard as of january using the effective date method that allows for entities to initially apply the new leases standard at the adoption date in addition we made several policy elections permitted under the transition guidance which among other things allowed us to carry forward the historical lease classification we determined that most renewal options would not be reasonably determinable in estimating the expected lease term we made the policy election available under topic to combine lease and nonlease components and applied this practical expedient to leases in effect prior to the date of adoption we will continue to apply the practical expedient to all leases entered into going forward the adoption of the new standard had an impact on our consolidated balance sheet as of january with the recording of operating rightofuse rou assets and

in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination instead under the amendments in this asu an entity should perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value however the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit additionally an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss if applicable an entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary this asu eliminates the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a

noncommercial loan portfolios and then further segmented into pools with similar risk characteristics the commercial portfolio comprising the majority of our total loans consists primarily of loans with short contractual maturities and is expected to result in a reduction to the allowance for credit losses this reduction is expected to be partially offset by an increase in the allowance for credit losses on the noncommercial portfolio as these assets have longer contractual maturities as well as an increase in reserves for the acquired loan portfolios additionally the reserve for unfunded commitments is expected to increase due to the change in scope under asu bancshares continues to evaluate the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements but expects the aggregate allowance for credit losses to decrease to with an initial increase to retained earnings of million the allowance associated with pcd loans did not have an impact on retained earnings as the cecl reserve is essentially replacing the existing nonaccretable discount the release of existing reserves due to the implementation of cecl will result in an increase to total riskbased capital and a decrease in tier capital the changes to capital are not expected to be significant the amendments in this asu are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after december

bancshares inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued credit quality indicators loans and leases are monitored for credit quality on a recurring basis commercial and noncommercial loans and leases have different credit quality indicators as a result of the unique characteristics of the loan segments being evaluated the credit quality indicators for nonpci and pci commercial loans and leases are developed through a review of individual borrowers on an ongoing basis commercial loans are evaluated periodically with more frequent evaluations done on criticized loans the indicators as of the date presented are based on the most recent assessment performed and are defined below pass a pass rated asset is not adversely classified because it does not display any of the characteristics for adverse classification special mention a special mention asset has potential weaknesses which deserve managements close attention if left uncorrected such potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects or collateral position at some future date special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not warrant adverse classification substandard a substandard asset is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged if any assets classified as substandard generally have a welldefined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt these assets are characterized by the distinct possibility of loss if the deficiencies are not corrected doubtful an asset classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in an asset classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable on the basis of currently existing facts conditions and values loss assets classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value it is inappropriate to be carried as an asset this classification is not necessarily equivalent to any potential for recovery or salvage value but rather it is not appropriate to defer a full chargeoff even though partial recovery may be affected in the future ungraded ungraded loans represent loans not included in the individual credit grading process due to their relatively small balances or borrower type the majority of ungraded loans at december and relate to business credit cards business credit card loans are subject to automatic chargeoff when they become days past due in the same manner as unsecured consumer lines of credit the remaining balance is comprised of a small amount of commercial mortgage lease financing and other commercial real estate loans the credit

be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date bancshares estimates fair value using discounted cash flows or other valuation techniques when there is no active market for a financial instrument inputs used in these valuation techniques are subjective in nature involve uncertainties and require significant judgment therefore the derived fair value estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts bancshares would realize in a current market exchange assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value according to a fair value hierarchy comprised of three levels the levels are based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value the level within the fair value hierarchy for an asset or liability is based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement with level inputs considered highest and level inputs considered lowest a brief description of each input level follows table start level inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities table endtable start level inputs are quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active inputs other than quoted prices observable for the assets or liabilities and market corroborated inputs table endtable start level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability these unobservable inputs and assumptions reflect estimates market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability table end bancshares management reviews any changes to its valuation methodologies to ensure they are appropriate and supportable and refines valuation methodologies as more marketbased data becomes available transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized at the end of the reporting period the methodologies used to estimate the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities are discussed below investment securities available for sale the fair value of us treasury government agency mortgagebacked and municipal securities and a portion of our corporate bonds are generally estimated using a third party pricing service the third party provider evaluates securities based on comparable investments with trades and market data and will utilize pricing models which use a variety of inputs such as benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads benchmark securities bids and offers as needed these securities are generally classified as level the remaining corporate bonds held are generally measured at fair value based on indicative bids from brokerdealers using inputs that are not directly observable these securities are considered level marketable equity securities equity securities are measured at fair value using observable closing prices the valuation also considers the amount of market activity by examining the trade volume of each security equity securities are classified as level if they are traded in an active market and as level if the observable closing price is from a less than active market loans held for sale certain residential real estate loans originated to be sold to investors are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices for similar types of loans accordingly the inputs used to calculate fair value of originated residential real estate loans held for sale are considered level inputs portfolio loans subsequently transferred to held for sale to be sold in the secondary market are transferred at fair value the fair value of the transferred portfolio loans is based on quoted prices and considered level inputs net loans and leases nonpci and pci fair value is estimated based on discounted future cash flows using the current interest rates at which loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality the inputs used in the fair value measurements for loans and leases are considered level inputs fhlb stock the carrying amount of fhlb stock is a reasonable estimate of fair value as these securities are not readily marketable and are evaluated for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the par value bancshares considers positive and negative evidence including the profitability and asset quality of the issuer dividend payment history and recent redemption experience when determining the ultimate recoverability of the par value bancshares investment in fhlb stock is ultimately recoverable at par the inputs used in the fair value measurement for the fhlb stock are considered level inputs first citizens bancshares inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements continued mortgage and other servicing rights mortgage and other servicing rights are carried at the lower of amortized cost or market and are therefore carried at fair value only when fair value is less than the amortized cost the fair value of mortgage and other servicing rights is performed using a pooling methodology similar loans are pooled together and a model which relies on discount rates estimates of prepayment rates and the weighted average cost to service the loans is used to determine the fair value the inputs used in the fair value measurement for mortgage and other servicing rights are considered level inputs deposits for nontime deposits carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value the fair value of time deposits is estimated by discounting future cash flows using the interest rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities the inputs used in the fair value measurement for deposits are considered level inputs borrowings for borrowings the fair values are determined based on recent trades or sales of the actual security if available otherwise fair values are estimated by discounting future cash flows using current interest rates for similar financial instruments the inputs used in the fair value measurement for fhlb borrowings subordinated debentures and other borrowings are considered level inputs payable to the fdic for sharedloss agreements the fair value of the payable to the fdic for sharedloss agreements is determined by the projected cash flows based on expected payments to the fdic in accordance with the sharedloss agreements cash flows are discounted using current discount rates to reflect the timing of the estimated amounts due to the fdic the inputs used in the fair value measurement for the payable to the fdic are considered level inputs offbalancesheet commitments and contingencies carrying amounts are reasonable estimates of the fair values for such financial instruments carrying amounts include unamortized fee income and in some cases reserves for any credit losses from those financial instruments these amounts are not material to bancshares financial position for all other financial assets and financial liabilities the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of the fair value as of
