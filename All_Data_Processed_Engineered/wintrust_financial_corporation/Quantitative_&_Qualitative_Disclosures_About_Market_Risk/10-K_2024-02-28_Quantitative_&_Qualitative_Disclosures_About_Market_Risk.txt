item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks effects of inflation a banking organizations assets and liabilities are primarily monetary changes in the rate of inflation do not have as great an impact on the financial condition of a bank as do changes in interest rates moreover interest rates do not necessarily change at the same percentage as inflation accordingly changes in inflation are not expected to have a material impact on the company assetliability management as an ongoing part of its financial strategy the company attempts to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income this effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk credit risk liquidity risk and maintenance of yield assetliability management policies are established and monitored by management in conjunction with the boards of directors of the banks subject to general oversight by the risk management committee of the companys board the policies establish guidelines for acceptable limits on the sensitivity of the market value of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates interest rate risk arises when the maturity or repricing periods and interest rate indices of the interestearning assets interestbearing liabilities and derivative financial instruments are different it is the risk that changes in the level of market interest rates will result in disproportionate changes in the value of and the net earnings generated from the companys interestearning assets interestbearing liabilities and derivative financial instruments the company continuously monitors not only the organizations current net interest margin but also the historical trends of these margins in addition management attempts to identify potential adverse changes in net interest income in future years as a result interest rate fluctuations by performing simulation analysis of various interest rate environments if a potential adverse change in net interest margin andor net income is identified management takes appropriate action with its assetliability structure to mitigate these potentially adverse situations please refer to item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion of the net interest margin since the companys primary source of interestbearing liabilities is from customer deposits the companys ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits is somewhat limited by customer preferences and local competition in the market areas in which the banks operate the rates terms and interest rate indices of the companys interest earning assets result primarily from the companys strategy of investing in loans and securities that permit the company to limit its exposure to interest rate risk together with credit risk while at the same time achieving an acceptable interest rate spread the companys exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on a regular basis by management and the risk management committees of the boards of directors of the banks and the company the objective of the review is to measure the effect on net income and to adjust balance sheet and derivative financial instruments to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximize net interest income while the company does not believe rapid rate cuts are warranted at this point we are assuming that there will be three basis point rate cuts starting june with that assumption our net interest margin should be reasonably stable in a narrow range around the current level for the near term the following interest rate scenarios display the percentage change in net interest income over a oneyear time horizon assuming increases and decreases of and basis points the static shock scenario results incorporate actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for balance sheet instruments following an instantaneous parallel change in market rates based upon a static ie no growth or constant balance sheet conversely the ramp scenario results incorporate managements projections of future volume and pricing of each of the product lines following a gradual parallel change in market rates over twelve months actual results may differ from these simulated results due to timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies the interest rate sensitivity for both the static shock and ramp scenarios at december and december is as follows table start table end table start static shock scenarios basis points basis points basis points basis points december december table end table start ramp scenarios basis points basis points basis points basis points december december table end one method utilized by financial institutions including the company to manage interest rate risk is to enter into derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments include interest rate swaps interest rate caps floors and collars futures forwards option contracts and other financial instruments with similar characteristics additionally the company enters into commitments to fund certain mortgage loans interest rate locks to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of mortgage loans to third party investors see note derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form 10k for further information on the companys derivative financial instruments during and the company entered into certain covered call option transactions related to certain securities held by the company the company uses these option transactions rather than entering into other derivative interest rate contracts such as interest rate floors to economically hedge positions and compensate for net interest margin compression by increasing the total return associated with the related securities through fees generated from these options although the revenue received from these options is recorded as noninterest income rather than interest income the increased return attributable to the related securities from these options contributes to the companys overall profitability the companys exposure to interest rate risk may be impacted by these transactions to further mitigate this risk the company may acquire fixed rate term debt or use financial derivative instruments there were no covered call options outstanding as of december or table start table end
