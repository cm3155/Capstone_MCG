strengths including strong loan and deposit growth which despite compression in net interest margin resulted in higher net interest income higher revenue from the wealth management and mortgage banking businesses and growth in the leasing business the company increased its loan portfolio from billion at december to billion at december this increase was primarily due to the growth in the companys commercial real estate portfolio residential real estate portfolio and the premium finance receivables portfolios as well as its commercial banking initiative loan growth was also attributed to the acquisitions of sbc incorporated sbc stc bancshares corp stc and rushoak corporation roc the company is focused on making new loans including in the commercial and commercial real estate sector

of risk accordingly during the company continued its practice of maintaining appropriate funding capacity to provide the company with adequate liquidity for its ongoing operations in this regard the company benefited from its strong deposit base a liquid shortterm investment portfolio and its access to funding from a variety of external funding sources the company had overnight liquid funds and interestbearing deposits with banks of billion and billion at december and respectively the company recorded net interest income of billion in compared to million and million in and respectively the higher level of net interest income recorded in compared to resulted primarily from a billion increase in average earning assets partially offset by a basis point decrease in the net interest margin in due to higher costs of deposits see net interest margin section later in this item for further detail noninterest income totaled million in increasing million or compared to the increase in noninterest income in compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in wealth management and mortgage banking revenues higher operating lease income from growth in our leasing divisions higher gains on investment securities higher service charges on deposits an increase on fees from customer interest rate swaps and positive adjustments from foreign currency remeasurement see noninterest

in salaries and employee benefits million higher equipment expense higher operating lease equipment depreciation an increase in amortization of intangible assets due to certain other intangible assets recognized as a result of the acquisition of cdec and higher marketing expenses the increase in salaries and employee benefits was specifically attributable to a million increase in salaries resulting from annual salary increases and larger staffing as the company grew including growth from acquisitions a million increase in commissions and incentive compensation primarily attributable to the companys incentive compensation programs and a million increase in employee benefits due to higher payroll taxes employee insurance and retirement savings plan costs these increases were partially offset during the period by lower costs for consulting services and professional fees data processing and fdic insurance see noninterest expense section later in this item for further detail as the company continues to experience strong growth in its balance sheet controlling operating expenses is a continued focus throughout the companys various business units management monitors expense control from period to period throughout the company and places an emphasis on the companys net overhead ratio which provides a measure of efficiency both on a consolidated basis and across business units the companys goal is to maintain a net overhead ratio below on a consolidated basis economic environment the economic environment in was characterized by compression in net interest margin especially in the second half of the year and continued competition as banks have experienced improvements in their financial condition allowing them to be more active in the lending market the company has employed certain strategies to manage net income in the current rate environment including those discussed below table start table end table start table end net interest income the company has leveraged its internal loan pipeline and external growth opportunities to grow its earning assets base the company also continues its efforts to improve its funding mix in the companys net interest margin decreased to on a fully taxequivalent basis as compared to on a fully taxequivalent basis in primarily as a result of rising costs of deposits as a result of the growth in earning assets partially offset by reduced net interest margin the company increased net interest income by million in compared to the company has continued its practice of writing call options against certain us treasury and agency securities to economically hedge the securities positions and receive fee income to compensate for net interest margin compression in the company recognized million in fees on covered call options compared to million in the company utilizes back to back interest rate derivative transactions primarily interest rate swaps to receive floating rate interest payments related to customer loans in these arrangements the company makes a floating rate loan to a borrower who prefers to pay a fixed rate to accommodate the risk management strategy of certain qualified borrowers the company enters a swap with its borrower to effectively convert the borrowers variable rate loan to a fixed rate however in order to minimize the companys exposure on these transactions and continue to receive a floating rate the company simultaneously executes an offsetting mirrorimage swap with various third parties noninterest income the interest rate environment impacts the profitability and mix of the companys mortgage banking business which generated revenues of million in and million in representing and of total net revenue in and respectively mortgage banking revenue is primarily comprised of gains on sales of mortgage loans originated for new home purchases as well as mortgage refinancing mortgage revenue is also impacted by changes in the fair value of mortgage

originations were related to refinancing of mortgages in approximately of originations were mortgages associated with new home purchases while of originations were related to refinancing of mortgages noninterest expense management believes expense management is important to enhance profitability amid the low interest rate environment and increased competition cost control and an efficient infrastructure should position the company appropriately as it continues its growth strategy management continues to be disciplined in its approach to growth and plans to leverage the companys existing expense infrastructure to expand its presence in existing and complimentary markets potentially impacting the cost control strategies discussed above the company anticipates increased costs resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate as well as continued investment in technology credit quality the companys credit quality metrics remained at historically favorable levels in the company continues to actively address nonperforming assets and remains disciplined in its approach to grow without sacrificing asset quality in particular table start the companys provision for credit losses totaled million compared to million in and million in net chargeoffs increased to million in of which million related to commercial and commercial real estate loans compared to million in of which million related to commercial and commercial real estate loans and million in of which million related to commercial and commercial real estate loans table end table start the companys allowance for loan losses increased to million at december reflecting an increase of million or when compared to at december approximately million or of the allowance for loan losses was associated with commercial real estate loans and another million or was associated with commercial loans table end table start the company has significant exposure to commercial real estate at december billion or of our loan portfolio was commercial real estate with approximately located in our market area the commercial real estate loan portfolio excluding purchased credit impaired pci loans was comprised of billion related to land and construction table end table start table end table start table end billion related to office buildings loans billion related to retail loans billion related to industrial use billion related to multifamily loans and billion related to mixed use and other use types in analyzing the commercial real estate market the company does not rely upon the assessment of broad market statistical data in large part because the companys market area is diverse and covers many communities each of which is impacted differently by economic forces affecting the companys general market area as such the extent of the decline in real estate valuations can vary meaningfully among the different types of commercial and other real estate loans made by the company the company uses its multichartered structure and local management knowledge to analyze and manage the local market conditions at each of its banks as of december the company had approximately million of nonperforming commercial real estate loans representing approximately of the total commercial real estate loan portfolio table start total nonperforming loans loans on nonaccrual status and loans more than days past due and still accruing interest were million of which million or was related to commercial real estate at december an increase of million compared to december nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans were at december compared to at december table end table start the companys other real estate owned decreased by million to million during from million at december the decrease in other real estate owned is primarily a result of million of oreo disposals and resolutions during the million of other real estate owned as of december was comprised of million of commercial real estate property million of residential real estate property and of residential real estate development property table end during management continued its efforts to aggressively resolve problem loans through liquidation rather than retention of loans or real estate acquired as collateral through the foreclosure process management believes these actions will serve the company well in the future by providing some protection for the company from further valuation deterioration and permitting management to spend less time on resolution of problem loans and more time on growing the companys core business and the evaluation of other opportunities management continues to direct significant attention toward the prompt identification management and resolution of problem loans the company has restructured certain loans by providing economic concessions to borrowers to better align the terms of their loans with their current ability to pay at december approximately million in loans had terms modified representing troubled debt restructurings tdrs with million of these tdrs continuing in accruing status see note allowance for loan losses allowance for losses on lendingrelated commitments and impaired loans of the consolidated financial statements presented under item of this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of tdrs the company enters into residential mortgage loan sale agreements with investors in the normal course of business the companys practice is generally not to retain longterm fixed rate mortgages on its balance sheet in order to mitigate interest rate risk and consequently sells most of such mortgages into the secondary market these agreements provide recourse to investors through certain representations concerning credit information loan documentation collateral and insurability investors request the company to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans which the investors believe do not comply with applicable representations an increase in requests for loss indemnification can negatively impact mortgage banking revenue as additional recourse expense the liability for estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification claims for residential mortgage loans previously sold to investors was million at both december and community banking through our community banking franchise we provide banking and financial services primarily to individuals small to midsized businesses local governmental units and institutional clients residing primarily in the local areas we service profitability of this franchise is primarily driven by our net interest income and margin our funding mix and related costs the level of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned the amount of mortgage banking revenue and our history of acquiring banking operations and establishing de novo banking locations net interest income and margin the primary source of our revenue is net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities to fund those assets including deposits and other borrowings net interest income can change significantly from period to period based on general levels of interest rates customer prepayment patterns the mix of interestearning assets and the mix of interestbearing and noninterest bearing deposits and borrowings funding mix and related costs the most significant source of funding in community banking is core deposits which are comprised of noninterest bearing deposits nonbrokered interestbearing transaction accounts savings deposits and domestic time deposits table start table end table start table end our branch network is the principal source of core deposits which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities community banking profitability has been bolstered in recent years as the company funded strong loan growth with a more desirable blend of funds level of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned the level of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned can significantly impact our profitability as these loans and other real estate owned do not accrue any income can be subject to chargeoffs and writedowns due to deteriorating market conditions and generally result in additional legal and collections expenses the companys credit quality measures have remained at historically low levels in recent years mortgage banking revenue our community banking franchise is also influenced by the level of fees generated by the origination of residential mortgages and the sale of such mortgages into the secondary market by wintrust mortgage the company recognized an increase of million in mortgage banking revenue in compared to as a result of higher origination volumes in and increased servicing fees mortgage originations for sale totaled billion and billion in and respectively expansion of banking operations our historical financial performance has been affected by costs associated with growing market share in deposits and loans establishing and acquiring banks opening new branch facilities and building an experienced management team our financial performance generally reflects the improved profitability of our banking subsidiaries as they mature offset by the costs of establishing and acquiring banks and opening new branch facilities in determining the timing of the opening of additional branches of existing banks and the acquisition of additional banks we consider many factors particularly our perceived ability to obtain an adequate return on our invested capital driven largely by the then existing cost of funds and lending margins the general economic climate and the level of competition in a given market see discussion of and acquisition activity in the recent acquisition transactions section below in addition to the factors considered above before we engage in expansion through de novo branches we must first make a determination that the expansion fulfills our objective of enhancing shareholder value through potential future earnings growth and enhancement of the overall franchise value of the company generally we believe that in normal market conditions expansion through de novo growth is a better longterm investment than acquiring banks because the cost to bring a de novo location to profitability is generally substantially less than the premium paid for the acquisition of a healthy bank each opportunity to expand is unique from a cost and benefit perspective both fdicassisted and nonfdicassisted acquisitions offer a unique opportunity for the company to expand into new and existing markets in a nontraditional manner potential acquisitions are reviewed in a similar manner as a de novo branch opportunities however fdicassisted and nonfdicassisted acquisitions have the ability to immediately enhance shareholder value factors including the valuation of our stock other economic market conditions the size and scope of the particular expansion opportunity and competitive landscape all influence the decision to expand via de novo growth or through acquisition specialty finance through our specialty finance segment we offer financing of insurance premiums for businesses and individuals lease financing and other direct leasing opportunities accounts receivable financing valueadded outsourced administrative services and other specialty finance businesses financing of commercial insurance premiums the primary driver of profitability related to the financing of commercial insurance premiums is the net interest spread that first insurance funding and fifc canada can produce between the yields on the loans generated and the cost of funds allocated to the business unit the commercial insurance premium finance business is a competitive industry and yields on loans are influenced by the market rates offered by our competitors the majority of loans originated by first insurance funding are purchased by the banks in order to more fully utilize their lending capacity as these loans generally provide the banks with higher yields than alternative investments we fund these loans primarily through our deposits the cost of which is influenced by competitors in the retail banking markets in our market area financing of life insurance premiums the primary driver of profitability related to the financing of life insurance premiums is the net interest spread that wintrust life finance can produce between the yields on the loans generated and the cost of funds allocated to the business unit profitability of financing both commercial and life insurance premiums is also meaningfully impacted by leveraging information technology systems maintaining operational efficiency and increasing average loan size each of which allows us to expand our loan volume without significant capital investment table start table end table start table end wealth management we offer a full range of wealth management services including trust and investment services taxdeferred likekind exchange services asset management solutions securities brokerage services and 401k and retirement plan services through four separate subsidiaries wintrust investments ctc great lakes advisors and cdec the primary drivers of profitability of the wealth management business can be associated with the level of commission received related to the trading performed by the brokerage customers for their accounts and the amount of assets under management in which the unit receives a management fee for advisory administrative and custodial services as such revenues are influenced by a rise or fall in the debt and equity markets and the resulting increase or decrease in the value of our client accounts on which our fees are based the commissions received by the brokerage unit are not as directly influenced by the directionality of the debt and equity markets but rather the desire of our customers to engage in trading based on their particular situations and outlooks of the market or particular stocks and bonds profitability in the brokerage business is impacted by commissions which fluctuate over time financial regulatory reform our business is heavily regulated by both federal and state agencies both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which our business is subject have increased in recent years in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes many of these changes have occurred as a result of the doddfrank act and its implementing regulations most of which are now in place while the regulatory environment has entered a period of rebalancing of the post financial crisis framework we expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision the exact impact of the changing regulatory environment on our business and operations depends upon legislative or regulatory changes to reform the financial regulatory framework and the actions of our competitors customers and other market participants legislative and regulatory changes could have a significant impact on us by for example requiring us to change our business practices requiring us to meet more stringent capital liquidity and leverage ratio requirements limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities imposing additional costs and compliance obligations on us limiting fees we can charge for services impacting the value of our assets or otherwise adversely affecting our businesses and our earnings capabilities we have already experienced significant increases in compliance related costs in recent years and we are now subject to more stringent riskbased capital and leverage ratio requirements than we were prior to the adoption of the us basel iii rules we are also now subject to many mortgagerelated rules promulgated by the cfpb that materially restructured the origination services and securitization of residential mortgages in

consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap in the united states and prevailing practices of the banking industry application of these principles requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes certain policies and accounting principles inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility that changes in those estimates and assumptions could produce financial results that are materially different than originally reported estimates assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required or elected to be recorded at fair value when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment writedown or valuation reserve to be established or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event and are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements accordingly as information changes the financial statements could reflect different estimates and assumptions a summary of the companys significant accounting policies is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements in item these policies along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this managements discussion and analysis section provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined management views critical accounting policies to be those which are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments estimates and assumptions and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the financial statements management views critical accounting policies to include the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for losses on lendingrelated commitments loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination estimations of fair value the valuations required for impairment testing of goodwill the valuation and accounting for derivative instruments and income taxes as the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available allowance for credit losses including the allowance for loan losses and allowance for losses on lendingrelated commitments the allowance for loan losses represents managements estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the fair value of the underlying collateral and amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends and conditions all of which are susceptible to significant change the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet the company also maintains an allowance for lendingrelated commitments specifically unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit which relates to certain amounts the company is committed to lend but for which funds have not yet been disbursed see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in item and the section titled loan portfolio and asset quality in item for a description of the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lendingrelated commitments as of january the company adopted cecl which impacts the measurement of the companys allowance for credit losses including the allowance for losses on lendingrelated commitments cecl replaces the previous incurred loss methodology which delays recognition until such loss is probable with a methodology that reflects an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses considering current economic condition and forecasts though other assets including investment securities and other receivables are considered inscope of the standard and will require a measurement of the allowance for credit loss the most significant impact of cecl remains within the companys loan portfolios and related lending commitments based upon the companys current composition of assets as well as current considerations of existing and expected future economic conditions at adoption the company estimates an increase to the allowance for credit losses consisting of the allowance for loan losses and allowance for losses on lendingrelated commitments prior to adoption of approximately to related to its loan portfolios and related lending commitments the estimated increase is partly related to additions to existing reserves for unfunded lendingrelated commitments due to the consideration under cecl of utilization by the companys borrowers over the life of such commitments as well as for acquired loans which previously considered credit discounts the company estimates an insignificant impact at adoption of measuring an allowance for credit losses for the other inscope assets noted above the adjustment at adoption on january is recognized as an adjustment to the balance sheet retained earnings or the related table start table end table start table end asset basis dependent upon whether the asset is purchased credit deteriorated from a prior acquisition after adoption adjustments to the allowance for credit losses will primarily be recorded as provision for credit losses on the companys income statement the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is highly dependent upon considerations of current and expected economic conditions which may result in earnings volatility across economic cycles see note recent accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements in item for additional discussion of the companys implementation and adoption of cecl loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination under accounting guidance applicable to loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination the excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the remaining estimated life of the loans using the effectiveinterest method the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference changes in the expected cash flows from the date of acquisition will either impact the accretable yield or result in a charge to the provision for credit losses subsequent decreases to expected principal cash flows will result in a charge to provision for credit losses and a corresponding increase to allowance for loan losses subsequent increases in expected principal cash flows will result in recovery of any previously recorded allowance for loan losses to the extent applicable and a reclassification from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield for any remaining increase all changes in expected interest cash flows including the impact of prepayments will result in reclassifications tofrom the nonaccretable difference accounting guidance as discussed above applicable to loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination is eliminated under the requirements of cecl and replaced by specific guidance related to purchased credit deteriorated financial assets under cecl the nonaccretable difference credit discount determined at acquisition on purchased credit deteriorated financial assets is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and added to the purchase price to determine the initial amortized cost of the financial asset the accretable yield will be recognized in interest income over the remaining estimated life of the financial asset using the effectiveinterest method changes in expected cash flows from the date of acquisition will only impact the allowance for credit losses no impact to accretable yield see note recent accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements in item for additional discussion of the companys implementation and adoption of cecl estimations of fair value a portion of the companys assets and liabilities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of condition with changes in fair value recorded either through earnings or other comprehensive income in accordance with applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the united states these include the companys trading account securities availableforsale securities equity securities with a readily determinable fair value derivatives mortgage loans heldforsale certain loans heldforinvestment and mortgage servicing rights msrs the determination of fair value is important for certain other assets including goodwill and other intangible assets impaired loans and other real estate owned that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates fair value is generally defined as the amount at which an asset or liability could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing unrelated parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale fair value is based on quoted market prices in an active market or if market prices are not available is estimated using models employing techniques such as matrix pricing or discounting expected cash flows the significant assumptions used in the models which include assumptions for interest rates discount rates prepayments and credit losses are independently verified against observable market data where possible where observable market data is not available the estimate of fair value becomes more subjective and involves a high degree of judgment in this circumstance fair value is estimated based on managements judgment regarding the value that market participants would assign to the asset or liability this valuation process takes into consideration factors such as market illiquidity imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount recorded on the balance sheet for a particular asset or liability with related impacts to earnings or other comprehensive income see note fair value of assets and liabilities to the consolidated financial statements in item for a further discussion of fair value measurements impairment testing of goodwill the company performs impairment testing of goodwill for each of its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently when events warrant using a qualitative or quantitative approach using a qualitative approach the company reviews any recent events or circumstances that would indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount these events and circumstances include the performance of the company the condition of the related industry in which the reporting unit operates and general economic environment and other factors if the company determines it is not more likely than not that there is impairment based on an evaluation of these events and circumstances the company may forgo the twostep quantitative approach table start table end table start table end using a quantitative approach the goodwill impairment analysis involves a twostep process the first step is a comparison of the reporting units fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit was determined to have been higher than its fair value the second step would have to be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss the second step allocates the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognized intangible assets in a hypothetical purchase price allocation analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill the company would record an impairment charge for the difference valuations are estimated in good faith by management through the use of publicly available valuations of comparable entities and discounted cash flow models using internal financial projections in the reporting units business plan under both a qualitative and quantitative approach the goodwill impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred events and factors that may significantly affect the analysis include a significant decline in the companys expected future cash flows a substantial increase in the discount rate a sustained significant decline in the companys stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate other factors might include changing competitive forces customer behaviors and attrition revenue trends cost structures along with specific industry and market conditions adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of intangible assets and could have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements as of december the company had three reporting units community banking specialty finance and wealth management based on the companys goodwill impairment testing no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units on their respective annual testing dates see note goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements in item for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing derivative instruments the company utilizes derivative instruments to manage risks such as interest rate risk or market risk the companys policy prohibits using derivatives for speculative purposes accounting for derivatives differs significantly depending on whether a derivative is designated as an accounting hedge which is a transaction intended to reduce a risk associated with a specific asset or liability or future expected cash flow at the time it is purchased in order to qualify as an accounting hedge a derivative must be designated as such at inception by management and meet certain criteria management must also continue to evaluate whether the instrument effectively reduces the risk associated with that item to determine if a derivative instrument continues to be an effective hedge the company must make assumptions and judgments about the continued effectiveness of the hedging strategies and the nature and timing of forecasted transactions if the companys hedging strategy were to become ineffective hedge accounting would no longer apply and the reported results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected see note derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements in item for a further discussion of derivative accounting income taxes the company is subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states canada and other jurisdictions where it conducts business these laws are complex and subject to potentially different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities in determining the provision for income taxes management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these inherently complex laws related regulations and case law in the process of preparing the companys tax returns management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws these interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on managements ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law management reviews its uncertain tax positions and recognition of the benefits of such positions on a regular basis on a quarterly basis management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year deferred tax assets and liabilities are reassessed on a quarterly basis if business events or circumstances

consumer bank lending the most significant fluctuations in the commercial portfolio allowance for loan losses from to occurred as a result of resolving a million impaired relationship during the third quarter of that was previously fully reserved for this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the allowance as a result of growth in the commercial portfolio and higher required specific reserves on impaired loans within the portfolio our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by a first mortgage lien and assignment of rents on the property since most of our bank branches are located in the chicago metropolitan area and southern wisconsin of our commercial real estate loan portfolio is located in this region as of december we have been able to effectively manage our total nonperforming commercial real estate loans as of december our allowance for loan losses related to this portfolio is million compared to million as of december the company also participates in mortgage warehouse lending by providing interim funding to unaffiliated mortgage bankers to finance residential mortgages originated by such bankers for sale into the secondary market the companys loans to the mortgage bankers are secured by the business assets of the mortgage companies as well as the specific mortgage loans funded by the company after they have been preapproved for purchase by third party end lenders the company may also provide interim financing for packages of mortgage loans on a bulk basis in circumstances where the mortgage bankers desire to competitively bid on a number of mortgages for sale as a package in the secondary market amounts advanced with respect to any particular mortgage loan are usually required to be repaid within days during our mortgage warehouse lines increased to million as of december from million as of december home equity loans our home equity loans and lines of credit are originated by each of our banks in their local markets where we have a strong understanding of the underlying real estate value our banks monitor and manage these loans and we conduct an automated review of all home equity loans and lines of credit at least twice per year this review collects current credit performance for each home equity borrower and identifies situations where the credit strength of the borrower is declining or where there are events that may influence repayment such as tax liens or judgments our banks use this information to manage loans that may be higher risk and to determine whether to obtain additional credit information or updated property valuations the rates we offer on new home equity lending are based on several factors including appraisals and valuation due diligence in order to reflect inherent risk and we place additional scrutiny on larger home equity requests in a limited number of cases we issue home equity credit together with first mortgage financing and requests for such financing are evaluated on a combined basis it is not our practice to advance more than of the appraised value of the underlying asset which ratio we refer to as the loantovalue ratio or ltv ratio and a majority of the credit we previously extended when issued had an ltv ratio of less than our home equity loan portfolio has performed well in light of the ongoing volatility in the overall residential real estate market residential real estate our residential real estate portfolio predominantly includes one to fourfamily adjustable rate mortgages construction loans to individuals and bridge financing loans for qualifying customers as of december our residential loan portfolio totaled billion or of our total outstanding loans our adjustable rate mortgages relate to properties located principally in the chicago metropolitan area and southern wisconsin or vacation homes owned by local residents these adjustable rate mortgages are often nonagency conforming adjustable rate mortgage loans decrease the interest rate risk we face on our mortgage portfolio however this risk is not eliminated due to the fact that such loans generally provide for periodic and lifetime limits on the interest rate adjustments among other features additionally adjustable rate mortgages may pose a higher risk of delinquency and default because they require borrowers to make larger payments when interest rates rise as of december million of our residential real estate mortgages or of our residential real estate loan portfolio were classified as nonaccrual million were or more days past due and still accruing million were to days past due and billion were current we believe that since our loan portfolio consists primarily of locally originated loans and since the majority of our borrowers are longerterm customers with lower ltv ratios we face a relatively low risk of borrower default and delinquency while we generally do not originate loans for our own portfolio with longterm fixed rates due to interest rate risk considerations we can accommodate customer requests for fixed rate loans by originating such loans and then selling them into the secondary market for which we receive fee income we may also selectively retain certain of these loans within the banks own portfolios where they are nonagency conforming or where the terms of the loans make them favorable to retain a portion of the loans we sold into the secondary market were sold with the servicing of those loans retained the amount of loans serviced for others as of table start table end table start table end december and was billion and billion respectively all other mortgage loans sold into the secondary market were sold without the retention of servicing rights the government national mortgage association gnma optional repurchase programs allow financial institutions acting as servicers to buy back individual delinquent mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from the securitized loan pool for which the institution was the original transferor of such loans at the option of the servicer and without prior authorization from gnma the servicer may repurchase such delinquent loans for an amount equal to the remaining principal balance of the loan under fasb asc topic transfers and servicing this repurchase option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria are met at which time the option becomes unconditional when the company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans under the unconditional repurchase option and the expected benefit of the potential repurchase is more than trivial the loans can no longer be reported as sold and must be brought back onto the balance sheet as loans regardless of whether the company intends to exercise the repurchase option these loans are reported as loans heldforinvestment part of the residential real estate portfolio with the offsetting liability being reported in accrued interest payable and other

insurance agents and brokers located throughout the united states and canada the insurance premiums financed are primarily for commercial customers purchases of liability property and casualty and other commercial insurance this lending involves relatively rapid turnover of the loan portfolio and high volume of loan originations because of the indirect nature of this lending through third party agents and brokers and because the borrowers are located nationwide and in canada this segment is more susceptible to third party fraud than relationship lending the company performs ongoing credit and other reviews of the agents and brokers and performs various internal audit steps to mitigate against the risk of any fraud the majority of these loans are purchased by the banks in order to more

division performs an overall credit and collateral review as part of this review all underlying collateral is identified and the valuation methodology is analyzed and tracked as a result of this initial review by the companys managed asset division the credit risk rating is reviewed and a portion of the outstanding loan balance may be deemed uncollectible or an impairment reserve may be established the companys impairment analysis utilizes an independent reappraisal of the collateral unless such a thirdparty evaluation is not possible due to the unique nature of the collateral such as a closelyheld business or thinly traded securities in the case of commercial realestate collateral an independent third party appraisal is ordered by the companys real estate services group to determine if table start table end table start table end there has been any change in the underlying collateral value these independent appraisals are reviewed by the real estate services group and

company including a downgrade in the credit risk rating movement to nonaccrual status a chargeoff or the establishment of a specific impairment reserve in the event a collateral shortfall is identified during the credit review process the company will work with the borrower for a principal reduction andor a pledge of additional collateral andor additional guarantees in the event that

the credit to minimize actual losses the companys approach to workout plans and restructuring loans is built on the creditrisk rating process a modification of a loan with an existing credit risk rating of or worse or a modification of any other credit which will result in a restructured credit risk rating of or worse must be reviewed for tdr classification in that event our managed assets division conducts an overall credit and collateral review a modification of a loan is considered to be a tdr if both the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and for economic or legal reasons the bank grants a concession to a borrower that it would not otherwise consider the modification of a loan where the credit risk rating is or better both before and after such modification is not considered to be a tdr based on the companys credit risk rating system it considers that borrowers whose credit risk rating is or better are not experiencing financial difficulties and therefore are

based on the average historical loss experience over a nineyear period and consideration of current environmental factors and economic trends all of which may be susceptible to significant change we determine this component of the allowance for loan losses by classifying each loan into i categories based on the type of collateral that secures the loan if any and ii one of ten categories based on the credit risk rating of the loan as described above under past due loans and nonperforming assets in this item each combination of collateral and credit risk rating is then assigned a specific loss

nineyear average loss rate assumption analysis is computed for each of the companys collateral codes the historical loss experience is combined with the specific loss factor for each combination of collateral and credit risk rating which is then applied to each individual loan balance to determine an appropriate general reserve the historical loss rates are updated on a quarterly basis and are driven by the performance of the portfolio and any changes to the specific loss factors are driven by management judgment and analysis of the factors described above the company also analyzes the three four five six seven and eightyear average historical loss rates on a quarterly basis as a comparison home equity and residential real estate loans the determination of the appropriate allowance for loan losses for residential real estate and home equity loans differs slightly from the process used for commercial and commercial real estate loans the same credit risk rating system problem loan reporting system collateral coding methodology and loss factor assignment are used the only significant difference is in how the credit risk ratings are assigned to these loans the home equity loan portfolio is reviewed on a loan by loan basis by analyzing current fico scores of the borrowers line availability recent line usage an approaching maturity and the aging status of the loan certain of these factors or combination of these factors may cause a portion of the credit risk ratings of home equity loans across all banks to be downgraded similar to commercial and commercial real estate

allowance for loan losses for these categories is entirely a general reserve methodology in assessing impairment and chargeoff amounts in determining the amount of impairment or chargeoffs associated with collateral dependent loans the company values the loan generally by starting with a valuation obtained from an appraisal of the underlying collateral and then deducting estimated selling costs to arrive at a net appraised value we obtain the appraisals of the underlying collateral typically on an annual basis from one of a preapproved list of independent third party appraisal firms types of appraisal valuations include asis ascomplete asstabilized bulk fair market liquidation and retail sellout values in many cases the company simultaneously values the underlying collateral by marketing the property to market participants interested in purchasing properties of the same type if the company receives offers or indications of interest we will analyze the price and review market conditions to assess whether in light of such information the appraised value overstates the likely price and that a lower price would be a better assessment of the market value of the property and would enable us to liquidate the collateral additionally the company takes into account the strength of any guarantees and the ability of the borrower to provide value related to those guarantees in determining the ultimate chargeoff or reserve associated with any impaired loans accordingly the company may chargeoff a loan to a value below the net appraised value if it believes that an expeditious liquidation is desirable in the circumstance and it has legitimate offers or other indications of interest to support a value that is less than the net appraised value alternatively the company may carry a loan at a value that is in excess of the appraised value if the company has a guarantee from a borrower that the company believes has realizable value in evaluating the strength of any guarantee the company evaluates the financial wherewithal of the guarantor the guarantors reputation and the guarantors willingness and desire to work with the company the company then conducts a review of the strength of a guarantee on a frequency established as the circumstances and conditions of the borrower warrant table start table end table start table end in circumstances where the company has received an appraisal but has no third party offers or indications of interest the company may enlist the input of realtors in the local market as to the highest valuation that the realtor believes would result in a liquidation of the property given a reasonable marketing period of approximately days to the extent that the realtors indication of market clearing price under such scenario is less than the net appraised valuation the company may take a chargeoff on the loan to a valuation that is less than the net appraised valuation the company may also chargeoff a loan below the net appraised valuation if the company holds a junior mortgage position in a piece of collateral whereby the risk to acquiring control of the property through the purchase of the senior mortgage position is deemed to potentially increase the risk of loss upon liquidation due to the amount of time to ultimately market the property and the volatile market conditions in such cases the company may abandon its junior mortgage and chargeoff the loan balance in full in other cases the company may allow the borrower to conduct a short sale which is a sale where the company allows the borrower to sell the property at a value less than the amount of the loan many times it is possible for the current owner to receive a better price than if the property is marketed by a financial institution which the market place perceives to have a greater desire to liquidate the property at a lower price to the extent that we allow a short sale at a price below the value indicated by an appraisal we may take a chargeoff beyond the value that an appraisal would have indicated other market conditions may require a reserve to bring the carrying value of the loan below the net appraised valuation such as litigation surrounding the borrower andor property securing our loan or other market conditions impacting the value of the collateral having determined the net value based on the factors such as those noted above and compared that value to the book value of the loan the company arrives at a chargeoff amount or a specific reserve included in the allowance for loan losses in summary for collateral dependent loans appraisals are used as the fair value starting point in the estimate of net value estimated costs to sell are deducted from the appraised value to arrive at the net appraised value although an external appraisal is the primary source of valuation utilized for chargeoffs on collateral dependent loans alternative sources of valuation may become available between appraisal dates as a result we may utilize values obtained through these alternative sources which include purchase and sale agreements legitimate indications of interest negotiated short sales realtor price opinions sale of the note or support from guarantors as the basis for chargeoffs these alternative sources of value are used only if deemed to be more representative of value based on updated information regarding collateral resolution in addition if an appraisal is not deemed current a discount to appraised value may be utilized any adjustments from appraised value to net value are detailed and justified in an impairment analysis which is reviewed and approved by the companys managed assets division tdrs at december the company had million in loans classified as tdrs the million in tdrs
