overview and strategy impact of covid19 in march the outbreak of covid19 was recognized as a global pandemic by the world health organization resulting in unprecedented uncertainty and volatility in worldwide financial markets governments actions calling for shelter in place and social distancing have led to rapid changes in business revenues increased unemployment and have impacted consumer activity all of which have impacted and may continue to impact the companys current and future results the company activated its pandemic response plan in early march as well as applicable elements of its business continuity plan in order to protect the health of our customers and employees and in accordance with applicable government directives we modified certain of our business protocols to direct employees to work from home unless their role required them to be on site in which case we have implemented enhanced safety measures including social distancing enhanced cleaning and sanitization and certain personal protective equipment with the phased reopening of certain state and municipal areas the company has developed a comprehensive plan that permits certain remote employees to return to their respective workplaces where enhanced safety measures also have been implemented at present however the majority of the companys workforce continues to work remotely on a nearly daily basis on march the cares act was enacted the cares act includes appropriations and other measures designed to address the impact of the covid19 pandemic including the paycheck protection program ppp which is designed to aid eligible small and mediumsized businesses through federallyguaranteed loans distributed through certain financial institutions under the administration of the small business administration sba from the date the company began accepting applications april through the end of the company secured authorization from the sba and funded over ppp loans for our customers with a carrying balance of approximately billion ppp loans are forgivable under certain circumstances including the borrowers use of certain loan proceeds to fund employee payroll during a specific period eg eight weeks weeks following disbursement of the borrowers ppp loan the company generated net fees of million to be recognized over the life of the ppp loans adjusted for estimated prepayments as of december the carrying balance of such loans was reduced to approximately billion primarily resulting from forgiveness by the sba all of our three primary business segments community banking specialty finance and wealth management have been uniquely impacted and we expect will continue to be impacted by the covid19 pandemic requiring the implementation of certain responses as circumstances evolve as nonexclusive examples of such impacts our community banking business including our mortgage business has received borrower requests for temporary payment relief including payment deferrals as of december loans totaling approximately million were modified as a result of covid19 disruption to our borrowers our insurance premium finance business is impacted by certain state legislation prohibiting canceling of insurance policies for designated periods our wealth management business is impacted by increased stock market volatility given the continued uncertainty regarding future economic conditions the company has taken a number of actions to help ensure that it has adequate liquidity and capital to manage through the covid19 pandemic including issuing fixedrate reset noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series e liquidation preference per share the series e preferred stock as part of a public offering of depositary shares each representing a th interest in a share of series e preferred stock the depositary shares we believe the company currently has adequate liquidity and capital to effectively manage through the covid19 pandemic however we will continue to prudently evaluate liquidity sources including the possible utilization of the ppp liquidity facility if necessary we continue to monitor the impact of covid19 closely however the

origination volume associated with the companys mortgage business see noninterest expense section later in this item for further detail management considers the maintenance of adequate liquidity to be important to the management of risk accordingly during the company continued its practice of maintaining appropriate funding capacity to provide the company with adequate liquidity for its ongoing

securities to economically hedge the securities positions and receive fee income to compensate for net interest margin compression in the company recognized million in fees on covered call options compared to million in the company utilizes back to back interest rate derivative transactions primarily interest rate swaps to receive floating rate interest payments related to customer loans in these arrangements the company makes a floating rate loan to a borrower who prefers to pay a fixed rate to accommodate the risk management strategy of certain qualified borrowers the company enters a swap with its borrower to effectively convert the borrowers variable rate loan to a fixed rate however in order to minimize the companys exposure on these transactions and continue to receive a floating rate the company simultaneously executes an offsetting mirrorimage swap with various third parties table start table end table start table end noninterest income the interest rate environment impacts the profitability and mix of the companys mortgage banking business which generated revenues of million in and million in representing and of total net revenue in and respectively mortgage

and an efficient infrastructure should position the company appropriately as it continues its growth strategy management continues to be disciplined in its approach to growth and plans to leverage the companys existing expense infrastructure to expand its presence in existing and complimentary markets potentially impacting the cost control strategies discussed above the company anticipates increased costs resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate as well as continued investment in technology credit quality the company continues to actively address nonperforming assets and remains disciplined in its approach to grow without sacrificing asset quality in particular the companys provision for credit losses totaled million compared to million in and million in the increased provision in was primarily the result of the adoption of cecl specifically continued change to macroeconomic conditions throughout created by the covid19 pandemic and the impact on the

the companys loan portfolios net chargeoffs decreased to million in of which million related to commercial and commercial real estate loans compared to million in of which million related to commercial and commercial real estate loans and million in of which million related to commercial and commercial real estate loans the companys allowance for loan and unfunded lendingrelated

cecl as of january and deterioration in macroeconomic conditions subsequent to that date related to covid19 at december approximately million or of the allowance for loan and unfunded lendingrelated commitment losses was associated with commercial real estate loans and an additional million or was associated with commercial loans the company has significant exposure to commercial real estate at december billion or of our loan portfolio was commercial real estate with approximately located in our market area the commercial real estate loan portfolio was comprised of billion in construction and development loans and billion in nonconstruction loans in analyzing the commercial real estate market the company does not rely upon the assessment of broad market statistical data in large part because the companys market area is diverse and covers many communities each of which is impacted differently by economic forces affecting the companys general market area as such the extent of the decline in real estate valuations can vary meaningfully among the different types of commercial and other real estate loans made by the company the company uses its multichartered structure and local management knowledge to analyze and manage the local market conditions at each of its banks total nonperforming loans loans on nonaccrual status and loans more than days past due and still accruing interest were million of which million or was related to commercial real estate at december an increase of million compared to december nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans were at

real estate owned as of december was comprised of million of commercial real estate property million of residential real estate property and million of residential real estate development property during management continued its efforts to aggressively resolve problem loans through liquidation rather than retention of loans or real estate acquired as collateral through the foreclosure process management believes these actions will serve the company well in the future by providing some protection for the company from further valuation deterioration and permitting management to spend less time on resolution of problem loans and more time on growing the companys core business and the evaluation of other opportunities management continues to direct significant attention toward the prompt identification management and resolution of problem loans the company has restructured certain loans by providing economic concessions to borrowers to better align the terms of their loans with their current ability to pay at december approximately million in loans had terms modified representing troubled debt restructurings tdrs with million of these tdrs continuing in accruing status see note allowance for credit losses to the consolidated financial statements presented under item of this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of tdrs the company enters into residential mortgage loan sale agreements with investors in the normal course of business the companys practice is generally not to retain longterm fixedrate mortgages on its balance sheet in order to mitigate interest rate risk and consequently sells most of such mortgages into the secondary market these agreements provide recourse to investors through certain representations concerning credit information loan documentation collateral and insurability investors request the company to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans which the investors believe do not comply with applicable representations an increase in requests for loss indemnification can negatively impact mortgage banking revenue as additional recourse expense the liability for estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification claims for residential mortgage loans previously sold to investors was million at december and million at december community banking through our community banking franchise we provide banking and financial services primarily to individuals small to midsized businesses local governmental units and institutional clients residing primarily in the local areas we service profitability of this franchise is primarily driven by our net interest income and margin our funding mix and related costs the measurement of the allowance for credit losses and the impact of current and forecasted macroeconomic conditions on such measurement the level of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned the amount of mortgage banking revenue and our history of acquiring banking operations and establishing de novo banking locations net interest income and margin the primary source of our revenue is net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities to fund those assets including deposits and other borrowings net interest income can change significantly from period to period based on general levels of interest rates customer prepayment patterns the mix of interestearning assets and the mix of interestbearing and noninterest bearing deposits and borrowings funding mix and related costs the most significant source of funding in community banking is core deposits which are comprised of noninterest bearing deposits nonbrokered interestbearing transaction accounts savings deposits and domestic time deposits our branch network is the principal source of core deposits which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities community banking profitability has been favorably impacted in recent years as the company funded strong loan growth with a more desirable blend of funds measurement of the allowance for credit losses the company adopted cecl as of january which requires the estimate of expected credit losses over the entire life of financial assets measured at amortized cost to measure lifetime expected credit losses the company adjusts credit loss estimates for reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic conditions such forecasts can significantly impact the profitability of our community banks as changing estimates of lifetime losses from period to period can result in significant fluctuations in provision for credit losses during those periods in such fluctuations in provision for credit losses unfavorably impacted the profitability of our community banks primarily as a result of forecasted deterioration in macroeconomic conditions from covid19 level of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned the level of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned can significantly impact our profitability as these loans and other real estate owned do not accrue any income can be subject to table start table end table start table end chargeoffs and writedowns due to deteriorating market conditions and generally result in additional legal and collections expenses the companys credit quality measures have remained at historically low levels in recent years mortgage banking revenue our community banking franchise is also influenced by the level of fees generated by the origination of residential mortgages and the sale of such mortgages into the secondary market by wintrust mortgage the company recognized an increase of million in mortgage banking revenue in compared to as a result of higher origination volumes in higher margins on sales and increased servicing fees mortgage originations for sale totaled billion and billion in and respectively increasing primarily as a result of demand associated with the historically low longterm interest rates in the market expansion of banking operations our historical financial performance has been affected by costs associated with growing market share in deposits and loans establishing and acquiring banks opening new branch facilities and building an experienced management team our financial performance generally reflects the improved profitability of our banking subsidiaries as they mature offset by the costs of establishing and acquiring banks and opening new branch facilities in determining the timing of the opening of additional branches of existing banks and the acquisition of additional banks we consider many factors particularly our perceived ability to obtain an adequate return on our invested capital driven largely by the then existing cost of funds and lending margins the general economic climate and the level of competition in a given market see discussion of acquisition activity in the recent acquisition transactions section below in addition to the factors considered above before we engage in expansion through de novo branches we must first make a determination that the expansion fulfills our objective of enhancing shareholder value through potential future earnings growth and enhancement of the overall franchise value of the company generally we believe that in normal market conditions expansion through de novo growth is a better longterm investment than acquiring banks because the cost to bring a de novo location to profitability is generally substantially less than the premium paid for the acquisition of a healthy bank each opportunity to expand is unique from a cost and benefit perspective both fdicassisted and nonfdicassisted acquisitions offer a unique opportunity for the company to expand into new and existing markets in a nontraditional manner potential acquisitions are reviewed in a similar manner as a de novo branch opportunities however fdicassisted and nonfdicassisted acquisitions have the ability to immediately enhance shareholder value factors including the valuation of our stock other economic market conditions the size and scope of the particular expansion opportunity and competitive landscape all influence the decision to expand via de novo growth or through acquisition specialty finance through our specialty finance segment we offer financing of insurance premiums for businesses and individuals lease financing and other direct leasing opportunities accounts receivable financing valueadded outsourced administrative services and other specialty finance businesses financing of commercial insurance premiums the primary driver of profitability related to the financing of commercial insurance premiums is the net interest spread that first insurance funding and fifc canada can produce between the yields on the loans generated and the cost of funds allocated to the business unit the commercial insurance premium finance business is a competitive industry and yields on loans are influenced by the market rates offered by our competitors the majority of loans originated by first insurance funding are purchased by the banks in order to more fully utilize their lending capacity as these loans generally provide the banks with higher yields than alternative investments we fund these loans primarily through our deposits the cost of which is influenced by competitors in the retail banking markets in our market area financing of life insurance premiums the primary driver of profitability related to the financing of life insurance premiums is the net interest spread that wintrust life finance can produce between the yields on the loans generated and the cost of funds allocated to the business unit profitability of financing both commercial and life insurance premiums is also meaningfully impacted by leveraging information technology systems maintaining operational efficiency and increasing average loan size each of which allows us to expand our loan volume without significant capital investment table start table end table start table end wealth management we offer a full range of wealth management services including trust and investment services taxdeferred likekind exchange services asset management solutions securities brokerage services and 401k and retirement plan services through four separate subsidiaries wintrust investments ctc great lakes advisors and cdec the primary drivers of profitability of the wealth management business can be associated with the level of commission received related to the trading performed by the brokerage customers for their accounts and the amount of assets under management in which the unit receives a management fee for advisory administrative and custodial services as such revenues are influenced by a rise or fall in the debt and equity markets and the resulting increase or decrease in the value of our client accounts on which our fees are based the commissions received by the brokerage unit are not as directly influenced by the directionality of the debt and equity markets but rather the desire of our customers to engage in trading based on their particular situations and outlooks of the market or particular stocks and bonds profitability in the brokerage business is impacted by commissions which fluctuate over time financial regulatory reform our business is heavily regulated by both federal and state agencies both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which our business is subject have increased in recent years in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes many of these changes have occurred as a result of the doddfrank act and its implementing regulations most of which are now in place while the regulatory environment has entered a period of rebalancing of the post financial crisis framework we expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision the exact impact of the changing regulatory environment on our business and operations depends upon legislative or regulatory changes to reform the financial regulatory framework and the actions of our competitors customers and other market participants legislative and regulatory changes could have a significant impact on us by for example requiring us to change our business practices requiring us to meet more stringent capital liquidity and leverage ratio requirements limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities imposing additional costs and compliance obligations on us limiting fees we can charge for services impacting the value of our assets or otherwise adversely affecting our businesses and our earnings capabilities we have already experienced significant increases in compliance related costs in recent years and we are now subject to more stringent riskbased capital and leverage ratio requirements than we were prior to the adoption of the us basel iii rules we are also now subject to many mortgagerelated rules promulgated by the cfpb that materially restructured the origination services and securitization of residential mortgages in the united states we will continue to monitor the impact that the implementation of applicable rules regulations and policies arising out of any legislative or regulatory changes may have on our organization for further discussion of the laws and regulations

insignificant summary of critical accounting policies the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap in the united states and prevailing practices of the banking industry application of these principles requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes certain policies and accounting principles inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility that changes in those estimates and assumptions could produce financial results that are materially different than originally reported estimates assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required or elected to be recorded at fair value when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment writedown or valuation reserve to be established or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event and are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements accordingly as information changes the

managements estimate of expected credit losses over the life of a financial asset carried at amortized cost determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical

pricing or discounting expected cash flows the significant assumptions used in the models which include assumptions for interest rates discount rates prepayments and credit losses are independently verified against observable market data where possible where observable market data is not available the estimate of fair value becomes more subjective and involves a high degree of judgment in this circumstance fair value is estimated based on managements judgment regarding the value that market participants would assign to the asset or liability this valuation process takes into consideration factors such as market illiquidity imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount recorded on the balance sheet for a particular asset or liability with related impacts to earnings or other comprehensive income see note fair value of assets and liabilities to the consolidated financial statements in item for a further discussion of fair value measurements impairment testing of goodwill the company performs impairment testing of goodwill for each of its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently when events warrant using a qualitative or quantitative approach using a qualitative approach the company reviews any recent events or circumstances that would indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount these events and circumstances include the performance of the company the condition of the related industry in which the reporting unit operates and general economic environment and other factors if the company determines it is not more likely than not that there is impairment based on an evaluation of these events and circumstances the company may forgo the twostep quantitative approach using a quantitative approach the goodwill impairment analysis involves a twostep process the first step is a comparison of the reporting units fair value to its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting unit was determined to have been higher than its fair value the second step would have to be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss the second step measures goodwill impairment by recognizing an impairment according to the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit over the calculated fair value of such unit valuations are estimated in good faith by management through the use of publicly available valuations of comparable entities and discounted cash flow models using internal financial projections in the reporting units business plan under both a qualitative and quantitative approach the goodwill impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred events and factors that may significantly affect the analysis include a significant decline in the companys expected future cash flows a substantial increase in the discount rate a sustained significant decline in the companys stock price and market capitalization a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate other factors might include changing competitive forces customer behaviors and attrition revenue trends cost structures along with specific industry and market conditions adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of intangible assets and could have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements as of december the company had three reporting units community banking specialty finance and wealth management based on the companys goodwill impairment testing no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units on their respective annual testing dates derivative instruments the company utilizes derivative instruments to manage risks such as interest rate risk or market risk the companys policy prohibits using derivatives for speculative purposes table start table end table start table end accounting for derivatives differs significantly depending on whether a derivative is designated as an accounting hedge which is a transaction intended to reduce a risk associated with a specific asset or liability or future expected cash flow at the time it is purchased in order to qualify as an accounting hedge a derivative must be designated as such at inception by management and meet certain criteria management must also continue to evaluate whether the instrument effectively reduces the risk associated with that item to determine if a derivative instrument continues to be an effective hedge the company must make assumptions and judgments about the continued effectiveness of the hedging strategies and the nature and timing of forecasted transactions if the companys hedging strategy were to become ineffective hedge accounting would no longer apply and the reported results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected see note derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements in item for a further discussion of derivative accounting income taxes the company is subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states canada and other jurisdictions where it conducts business these laws are complex and subject to potentially different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities in

preparing the companys tax returns management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws these interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on managements ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law management reviews its uncertain tax positions and recognition of the benefits of such positions on a regular basis on a quarterly basis management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year deferred tax assets and liabilities are reassessed on a quarterly basis if business events or circumstances warrant additionally any enactment of new tax rates such as the enactment of the tax act in

able to effectively manage our total nonperforming commercial real estate loans as of december our allowance for credit losses related to this portfolio was million compared to million as of december similar to the commercial loan portfolio the increase in the allowance for credit losses is primarily due to the adoption of cecl and deterioration in macroeconomic conditions related to covid19 specifically as reflected by the commercial real estate price index the company also participates in mortgage warehouse lending which is included above within commercial industrial and other by providing interim funding to unaffiliated mortgage bankers to finance residential mortgages originated by such bankers for sale into the secondary market the companys loans to the mortgage bankers are secured by the business assets of the mortgage companies as well as the specific mortgage loans funded by the company after they have been preapproved for purchase by third party end lenders the company may also provide interim financing for packages of mortgage loans on a bulk basis in circumstances where the mortgage bankers desire to competitively bid on a number of mortgages for sale as a package in the secondary market amounts advanced with respect to any particular mortgage loan are usually required to be repaid within days home equity loans our home equity loans and lines of credit are originated by each of our banks in their local markets where we have a strong understanding of the underlying real estate value our banks monitor and manage these loans and we conduct an automated review of all home equity loans and lines of credit at least twice per year this review collects current credit performance for each home equity borrower and identifies situations where the credit strength of the borrower is declining or where there are events that may influence repayment such as tax liens or judgments our banks use this information to manage loans that may be higher risk and to determine whether to obtain additional credit information or updated property valuations the rates we offer on new home equity lending are based on several factors including appraisals and valuation due diligence in order to reflect inherent risk and we place additional scrutiny on larger home equity requests in a limited number of cases we issue home equity credit together with first mortgage financing and requests for such financing are evaluated on a combined basis it is not our practice to advance more than of the appraised value of the underlying asset which ratio we refer to as the loantovalue ratio or ltv ratio and a majority of the credit we previously extended when issued had an ltv ratio of less than our home equity loan portfolio has performed well in light of the ongoing volatility in the overall residential real estate market residential real estate our residential real estate portfolio predominantly includes one to fourfamily adjustable rate mortgages construction loans to individuals and bridge financing loans for qualifying customers as of december our residential loan portfolio totaled billion or of our total outstanding loans our adjustable rate mortgages relate to properties located principally in the chicago metropolitan area and southern wisconsin or vacation homes owned by local residents these adjustable rate mortgages are often nonagency conforming adjustable rate mortgage loans decrease the interest rate risk we face on our mortgage portfolio however this risk is not eliminated due to the fact that such loans generally provide for periodic and lifetime limits on the interest rate adjustments among other features additionally adjustable rate mortgages may pose a higher risk of delinquency and default because they require borrowers to make larger payments when interest rates rise as of december million of our residential real estate mortgages or of our residential real estate loan portfolio were classified as nonaccrual no balances were or more days past due and still accruing million were to days past due or and billion were current or we believe that since our loan portfolio consists primarily of locally originated loans and since the majority of our borrowers are longerterm customers with lower ltv ratios we face a relatively low risk of borrower default and delinquency due to interest rate risk considerations we generally sell in the secondary market loans originated with longterm fixed rates for which we receive fee income we may also selectively retain certain of these loans within the banks own portfolios where they are nonagency conforming or where the terms of the loans make them favorable to retain a portion of the loans we sold into the secondary market were sold with the servicing of those loans retained the amount of loans serviced for others as of december and was billion and billion respectively all other mortgage loans sold into the secondary market were sold without the retention of servicing rights the government national mortgage association gnma optional repurchase programs allow financial institutions acting as servicers to buyout individual

topic transfers and servicing this early buyout option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria are met at which time the option becomes unconditional when the company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans under the unconditional repurchase option and the expected benefit of the potential repurchase is more than trivial the loans can no longer be reported as sold and must be brought back onto the balance sheet as loans at fair value regardless of whether the company intends to exercise the early buyout option these rebooked loans are reported as loans heldforinvestment part of the residential real estate portfolio with the offsetting liability being reported in accrued interest payable and other liabilities rebooked gnma loans heldforinvestment amounted to million at december compared to million at december the decrease in balance from december to december was the result of the company increasing its exercise of such early

insurance premiums they pay on their commercial insurance policies the loans are originated by working through independent medium and large insurance agents and brokers located throughout the united states and canada the insurance premiums financed are primarily for commercial customers purchases of liability property and casualty and other commercial insurance this lending involves relatively rapid turnover of the loan portfolio and high volume of loan originations because of the indirect nature of this lending through third party agents and brokers and because the borrowers are located nationwide and in canada this segment is more susceptible to third party fraud than relationship lending the company performs ongoing credit and other reviews of the agents and brokers and performs various internal audit steps to mitigate against the risk of any fraud the majority of these loans are purchased by the banks in order to more fully utilize their lending capacity as these loans

ongoing detailed tracking mechanism for each problem loan once management determines that a loan has deteriorated to a point where it has a credit risk rating of or worse the companys managed asset division performs an overall credit and collateral review as part of this review all underlying collateral is identified and the valuation methodology is analyzed and tracked as a result of this initial review by the companys managed asset division the credit risk rating is reviewed and a portion of the outstanding loan balance may be deemed uncollectible and as a result no longer share similar risk characteristics as its related pool if that is the case the individual loan is considered collateral dependent and individually assessed for an allowance for credit loss the companys individual assessment utilizes an independent reappraisal of the collateral unless such a thirdparty evaluation is not possible due to the unique nature of the collateral such as a closelyheld table start table end table start table end business or thinly traded securities in the case of commercial real estate collateral an independent third party appraisal is ordered by the companys real estate

original contractual terms if the borrower has failed to comply with the original contractual terms further action may be required by the company including a downgrade in the credit risk rating

the appropriate chargeoff for collateraldependent loans the company considers the results of appraisals for the associated collateral the companys approach to workout plans and restructuring loans is built on the creditrisk rating process a modification of a loan with an existing credit risk rating of or worse or a modification of any other credit which will result in a restructured credit risk rating of or worse must be reviewed for tdr classification in that event our managed assets division conducts an overall credit and collateral review a modification of a loan is considered to be a tdr if both the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and for economic or legal reasons the bank grants a concession to a borrower that it would not otherwise consider the modification of a loan where the credit risk rating is or better both before and after such modification is not considered to be a tdr based on the companys credit risk rating system it considers that borrowers whose credit

losses see note of the consolidated financial statements presented under item of this report for further discussion of activity within the allowance for credit losses during the period and the relationship with respective loan balances for each loan category and the total loan portfolio how we determine the allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective or pooled basis by loans that share similar risk characteristics if the loan no longer exhibits risk characteristics similar to that of a pool typically due to credit deterioration of the related borrower the company analyzes the loan for purposes of individually assessing a specific allowance for credit loss as part of the problem loan reporting system review a separate reserve is collectively measured for loans continuing to share risk characteristics and as a result remaining in the pools see note of the consolidated financial statements presented under item of this report for further discussion of the allowance for credit losses measurement process collective measurement the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective or pooled basis when similar risk characteristics exist based upon the segmentation discussed above the company utilizes modeling methodologies that estimate lifetime credit loss rates on each pool including methodologies estimating the probability of default and loss given default on specific segments historical credit loss history is adjusted for reasonable and supportable forecasts developed by the company on a quantitative or qualitative basis and incorporates third party economic forecasts reasonable and supportable forecasts consider the macroeconomic factors that are most relevant to evaluating and predicting expected credit losses in the companys financial assets currently the company utilizes an eight quarter forecast period using a single macroeconomic scenario provided by a thirdparty and reviewed within the companys governance structure for periods beyond the ability to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts the company reverts to historical loss rates at an input level straightline over a four quarter reversion period expected credit losses are measured over the contractual term of the financial asset with consideration of expected prepayments expected extensions renewals or modifications of the financial asset are only considered when either the expected extension renewal or modification is contained within the existing agreement and is not unconditionally cancelable or the expected extension renewal or modification is reasonably expected to result in a tdr the methodologies discussed above are applied to both current asset balances on the companys consolidated statements of condition and offbalance sheet commitments ie unfunded lendingrelated commitments individual assessment loans with a credit risk rating of a through are reviewed on a monthly basis to determine if a an amount is deemed uncollectible a chargeoff or b it is probable that the company will be unable to collect amounts due in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan in cases in which collectability is not probable the loan is considered to no longer exhibit shared risk characteristics of a pool and as a result is individually assessed for allowance for credit losses measurement

loans differs from the process used for commercial and commercial real estate loans these portfolios utilize the weightedaverage remaining maturity warm methodology the warm methodology is an assumptionbased approach that utilizes historical loss and prepayment information as the basis to estimate prepayment and credit adjusted contractual cash flows the company considers a qualitative factor to adjust historical information for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts the same credit risk rating system and problem loan reporting systems are used the only significant difference is in how the credit risk ratings are assigned to these loans the home equity loan portfolio is reviewed on a loan by loan basis by analyzing current fico scores of the borrowers line availability recent line usage an approaching maturity and the aging status of the loan certain of these factors or combination of these factors may cause a portion of the credit risk

underlying collateral evaluated by the managed assets division premium finance receivables the determination of the appropriate allowance for credit losses for premium finance receivables is an assumptionbased approach focusing on historical loss rates in the portfolio adjusted qualitatively for current macroeconomic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts methodology in assessing impairment and chargeoff amounts in determining the amount of reserves or chargeoffs associated with collateral dependent loans the company values the loan generally by starting with a valuation obtained from an appraisal of the underlying collateral and then deducting estimated selling costs if appropriate to arrive at a net appraised value we obtain the appraisals of the underlying collateral typically on an annual basis from one of a preapproved list of independent third party appraisal firms types of appraisal valuations include asis ascomplete asstabilized bulk fair market liquidation and retail sellout values in many cases the company simultaneously values the underlying collateral by marketing the property to market participants interested in purchasing properties of the same type if the company receives offers or indications of interest we will analyze the price and review market conditions to assess whether in light of such information the appraised value overstates the likely price and that a lower price would be a better assessment of the market value of the property and would enable us to liquidate the collateral additionally the company takes into account the strength of any guarantees or other credit enhancements and the ability of the borrower to provide value related to those guarantees in determining the ultimate chargeoff or reserve associated with any individually assessed loans accordingly the company may chargeoff a loan to a value below the net appraised value if it believes that an expeditious liquidation is desirable in the circumstance and it has legitimate offers or other indications of interest to support a value that is less than the net appraised value alternatively the company may carry a loan at a value that is in excess of the appraised value if the company has a guarantee from a borrower or other credit enhancements that the company believes has realizable value in evaluating the strength of any guarantee the company evaluates the financial wherewithal of the guarantor the guarantors reputation and the guarantors willingness and desire to work with the company the company then conducts a review of the strength of a guarantee on a frequency established as the circumstances and conditions of the borrower warrant in circumstances where the company has received an appraisal but has no third party offers or indications of interest the company may enlist the input of realtors in the local market as to the highest valuation that the realtor believes would result in a liquidation of the property given a reasonable marketing period of approximately days to the extent that the realtors indication of market clearing price under such scenario is less than the net appraised valuation the company may take a chargeoff on the loan to a valuation that is less than the net appraised valuation the company may also chargeoff a loan below the net appraised valuation if the company holds a junior mortgage position in a piece of collateral whereby the risk to acquiring control of the property through the purchase of the senior mortgage position is deemed to potentially increase the risk of loss upon liquidation due to the amount of time to ultimately market the property and the volatile market conditions in such cases the company may abandon its junior mortgage and chargeoff the loan balance in full in other cases the company may allow the borrower to conduct a short sale which is a sale where the company allows the borrower to sell the property at a value less than the amount of the loan many times it is possible for the current owner to receive a better price than if the property is marketed by a financial institution which the market place perceives to have a greater desire to liquidate the property at a lower price to the extent that we allow a short sale at a price below the value indicated by an appraisal we may take a chargeoff beyond the value that an appraisal would have indicated other market conditions may require a reserve to bring the carrying value of the loan below the net appraised valuation such as litigation surrounding the borrower andor property securing our loan or other market conditions impacting the value of the collateral having determined the net value based on the factors such as those noted above and compared that value to the book value of the loan the company arrives at a chargeoff amount or a specific reserve included in the allowance for credit losses in table start table end table start table end summary for collateral dependent loans appraisals are used as the fair value starting point in the estimate of net value estimated costs to sell are deducted from the appraised value when appropriate under current accounting rules to arrive at the net appraised value although an external appraisal is the primary source of valuation utilized for chargeoffs on collateral
