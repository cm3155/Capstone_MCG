item risk factors table end risk factors summary the summary of risks below provides an overview of the principal risks we are exposed to in the normal course of our business activities this summary does not contain all of the information provided in the detailed discussion of risks that follows this summary and should be read together with such detailed discussion risks related to economic

some or all ppp loan guaranties the repayment of commercial loans which are largely dependent upon the financial success and economic viability of the borrower our loan portfolio being secured by real estate in particular commercial real estate events impacting collateral consisting of real property any inaccurate assumptions in our analytical and forecasting models and environmental liability risk associated with lending activities risks related to our niche businesses includes risks related to our premium finance business which may involve a higher risk of delinquency or collection than our

risks related to financial strength and liquidity includes risks related to changes in prevailing interest rates our liquidity position an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength loss of deposits or a change in deposit mix our credit rating capital not being available when it is needed or the cost of that capital being very high disruption in the financial markets and being a bank holding company and therefore being limited in sources of funds including to pay dividends table start table end risks related to general operations includes risks related to our controls and procedures our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties security risks including cyberattacks information security breaches and other similar incidents and those associated with debit cards and debit card transactions the failure of vendors the accuracy and completeness of information we receive about our customers and counterparties to make credit decisions our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel losses incurred in connection with actual or projected repurchases and indemnification payments related to mortgages that we have sold into the secondary market and the occurrence of extraordinary events such as acts of war terrorist attacks natural disasters and public health threats risks related to ownership of our common stock antitakeover provisions could negatively impact our shareholders risk factors an investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent to our business certain material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect wintrust are described below before making an investment decision you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on s with the sec additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair wintrusts business operations this annual report on form 10k is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if this were to happen the value of our securities could decline significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment risks related to economic conditions and operating environment deterioration in economic conditions may materially adversely affect the financial services industry and our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows our business activities and earnings are affected by general business conditions in the united states and abroad including factors such as the level and volatility of shortterm and longterm interest rates inflation home prices unemployment and underemployment levels bankruptcies household income consumer spending fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets liquidity of the global financial markets the availability and cost of capital and credit investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets and the strength of the domestic economies in which we operate the deterioration of any of these conditions can adversely affect our consumer and commercial businesses and securities portfolios our level of chargeoffs and provision for credit losses our capital levels and liquidity and our results of operations as a lending institution our business is directly affected by the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans as well as by the value of collateral such as real estate that secures many of our loans any economic deterioration from current levels or slowing of current economic activity could lead to an increase in loan chargeoffs and negatively affect consumer confidence as well as the level of business activity net chargeoffs totaled million in from million in our balance of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned oreo was million and million respectively at december compared to million and million respectively at december deterioration in the economy and real estate markets higher inflation rising interest rates or increased unemployment rates particularly in the markets in which we operate will likely diminish the ability of our borrowers to repay loans that we have made to them decrease the value of any collateral securing such loans and may cause increases in delinquencies problem assets chargeoffs and provision for credit losses all of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations further the underwriting and credit monitoring policies and procedures that we have adopted may not prevent losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows a us government debt default or rating downgrade could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance including a decrease in the value of treasury bonds and other government securities we hold which could negatively impact the banks capital position and ability to meet regulatory requirements other negative impacts could include volatile capital markets an adverse impact on the us economy and the us dollar as well as increased default rates among borrowers in light of increased economic uncertainty some of these impacts might occur even in the absence of an actual default by or rating downgrade of the us government but as a consequence of the uncertainty caused by extended political negotiations around the threat of such a default or rating downgrade and a us government shutdown table start table end since our business is concentrated in the chicago metropolitan and southern wisconsin market areas economic declines in the economy of this region could adversely affect our business except for our premium finance business and certain other niche businesses our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the specific local markets in which we operate unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in the chicago metropolitan and southern wisconsin market areas the local economic conditions in these areas significantly impact the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources in addition the state of illinois has experienced significant financial difficulty in recent years to the extent that these issues impact the economic vitality of the state and the businesses operating in illinois businesses may be encouraged to leave the state or new employers may be discouraged to start or move businesses to illinois which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations climate change manifesting as transition physical or other risks could adversely affect our operations businesses customers reputation and financial condition there is an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters the physical risks of climate change include discrete events such as flooding hurricanes tornadoes and wildfires and longerterm shifts in climate patterns such as extreme heat sea level rise and more frequent and prolonged drought such events could disrupt our operations or those of our customers or third parties on which we rely including through direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility additionally transitioning to a lowcarbon economy will entail extensive policy legal technology and market initiatives transition risks including changes in consumer preferences additional regulatory requirements or taxes and additional counterparty or customer requirements could increase our expenses undermine our strategies and impact our financial condition in addition our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our practices related to climate change including our involvement or our clients involvement in certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change as climate risk is interconnected with all key risk types we have begun to develop and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our risk management strategies established for risks such as market credit and operational risks however because the timing and severity of climate change may not be predictable our risk management strategies may not be effective in mitigating climate risk exposure the effects of covid19 have adversely impacted our operations and financial performance and could have similar adverse impacts in future periods although the us and global economies continue to recover from the covid19 pandemic certain adverse consequences of the pandemic including labor shortages disruptions of global supply chains and inflationary pressures could continue to impact the macroeconomic environment and could adversely affect our business many of our employees continue to work remotely on at least a hybrid basis which may create increased costs of operations or other operational difficulties including increased cybersecurity risk we may also experience additional operational risk due to difficulties experienced by our vendors risks related to competition and reputation the financial services industry is very competitive and if we are not able to compete effectively we may lose market share and our business could suffer we face competition in attracting and retaining deposits making loans and providing other financial services including wealth management services throughout our market area our competitors include national regional and other community banks and a wide range of other financial institutions such as credit unions governmentsponsored enterprises mutual fund companies insurance companies factoring companies and other nonbank financial companies such as marketplace lenders and other financial technology companies many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and market presence or more advanced technology than wintrust and as a result of their size may be able to offer a broader range of products and services table start table end better pricing for those products and services or newer technologies to deliver those products and services than we can several of our local competitors have experienced improvements in their financial condition over the past few years and are better positioned to compete for loans acquisitions and personnel the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation for example the economic growth act and its implementing regulations significantly reduce the regulatory burden of certain large bhcs and raise the asset thresholds at which more onerous requirements apply which could cause certain large bhcs to become more competitive or to more aggressively pursue expansion also technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks such as mobile payment and other automatic transfer and payment systems and for banks that do not have a physical presence in our markets to compete for deposits the absence of regulatory requirements may give nonbank financial companies a competitive advantage over wintrust our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including among other things the ability to develop maintain and build upon longterm customer relationships based on top quality service and high ethical standards the scope relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands the ability to expand our market position the ability to uphold our reputation in the marketplace the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors customer satisfaction with our level of service and industry and general economic trends if we are unable to compete effectively our market share and income from deposits loans and other products may be reduced this could adversely affect our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations damage to our reputation may harm our business maintaining trust in the company is critical to our ability to attract and maintain customers investors and employees if our reputation is damaged our business could be significantly harmed harm to our reputation could arise from numerous sources including among others employee misconduct security and cybersecurity breaches compliance failures litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations our reputation could also be harmed by the failure or perceived failure of an affiliate or a vendor or other third party with which we do business to comply with applicable laws or regulations in addition our reputation or prospects could be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding the company whether or not true that may be posted on social media nonmainstream news services or other parts of the internet and this risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect our reputation for example the role played by financial services firms during and after the financial crisis including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions or that a financial institution had acted inappropriately with respect to the methods employed in offering products to customers have damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole in addition increased focus on environmental social and governance esg issues including without limitation the impact of climate change or our diversity initiatives could damage our reputation or prospects if customers prospective customers investors or third parties assigning esg ratings to the company are of the opinion that the companys practices including without limitation our lending practices are not sufficiently robust from an esg perspective or otherwise disagree with the companys practices simultaneous disparate and divergent sentiments on esgrelated matters from multiple stakeholder groups increase the risk that any action or lack thereof by us on such matters will be perceived negatively by some stakeholders failing to comply with expectations and standards from investors customers regulators policymakers and other stakeholders regarding esgrelated issues or taking action in conflict with one or another of those stakeholders expectations could also lead to a loss of business adverse publicity an adverse impact on our reputation customer complaints or other adverse consequences should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine our reputation occur there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that we may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the damage to our reputation would not adversely affect our earnings and results of operations or that damage to our reputation will not impair our ability to retain our table start table end existing customers and employees or attract new customers and employees harm to our reputation or the reputation of our industry may also result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny which may lead to changes in laws or regulations that could constrain our business or operations events that result in damage to our reputation may also increase our litigation risk consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions which could adversely affect our business and results of operations technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods for example consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may be adversely impacted by the soundness of other financial institutions adverse developments affecting the overall strength and soundness of other financial institutions the financial services industry as a whole and the general economic climate and the us treasury market could have a negative impact on perceptions about the strength and soundness of our business even if we are not subject to the same adverse developments in addition adverse developments with respect to third parties with whom we have important relationships could also negatively impact perceptions about us these perceptions about us could cause our business to be negatively affected and exacerbate the other risks that we face wintrust may be impacted by actual or perceived soundness of other financial institutions including as a result of the financial or operational failure of a major financial institution or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a financial institution or its ability to fulfill its obligations which can cause substantial and cascading disruption within the financial markets and increased expenses including fdic insurance premiums and could affect our ability to attract and retain depositors and to borrow or raise capital the failure of other banks and financial institutions and the measures taken by governments businesses and other organizations in response to these events could adversely impact wintrusts business financial condition and results of operations wintrusts ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including the federal home loan bank fhlb commercial banks brokers and dealers investment banks and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose us to credit risk as well as market and liquidity risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount due to us any such losses could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition recent events impacting the banking industry including the bank failures in early have resulted in significant disruption and volatility in the capital markets reduced current valuation of securities portfolios and bank stocks and decreased confidence in banks among depositors and other counterparties as well as investors these events occurred in the context of rapidly rising interest rates which among other things have resulted in unrealized losses in longer duration debt securities and loans held by banks increased competition for deposits and potentially increased risk of a recession a decrease in the supply of deposits or significant increase in competition for deposits could result in substantial increases in costs to retain and service deposits increased adoption of consumer banking technology can result in reduced deposit retention due to the relevant ease with which depositors may transfer deposits to a different depository institution in the event that confidence is lost in us or any of our bank subsidiaries table start table end risks related to growth and acquisitions if we are unable to continue to identify favorable acquisitions or successfully integrate our acquisitions our growth may be limited and our results of operations could suffer in the past we have completed numerous acquisitions of banks other financial services related companies and financial services related assets including acquisitions of troubled financial institutions as more fully described below we expect to continue to make such acquisitions in the future wintrust seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar have experienced management possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management economies of scale or expanded services failure to successfully identify and complete acquisitions may result in wintrust achieving slower growth the standards by which bank and financial institution acquisitions will be evaluated are currently in flux and some banking organizations are experiencing delays in the processing of applications in july president biden issued an executive order on competition that requires the banking agencies to review the standards for bank mergers and the department of justice has announced that it is reviewing its bank merger guidelines it is expected that these reviews will tighten the standards for bank mergers and may change how the financial stability factor is evaluated for instance the occ has proposed a policy statement on the occs substantive approach to evaluating bank mergers under the bank merger act bma outlining the general principles the occ would apply when reviewing bank merger applications and clarifies how the occ would consider the statutory factors under the bma the policy statement would also identify certain indicators as generally consistent with occ approval which include among others appropriate capital and supervisory ratings lack of enforcement or fair lending actions lack of significant cra or consumer compliance concerns or significant adverse effect on competition and that the resulting institution would have total assets less than billion the company is assessing the proposal and its possible impact on the companys strategy in addition some members of congress have called for a moratorium of any bank merger and acquisition of greater than billion in assets while the company is still much smaller in asset size than billion we cannot exclude the possibility that we may be subject to higher antitrust standards enhanced scrutiny under the financial stability risk factor or have a potential acquisition challenged acquiring other banks businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions including among other things potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities or asset quality issues of the target company failure to adequately estimate the level of loan losses at the target company difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company potential disruption to our business including diversion of our managements time and attention the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company difficulty in estimating the value of the target company and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and therefore some dilution of wintrusts tangible book value and net income per common share may occur as a result of any future acquisitions in addition certain acquisitions may expose us to additional regulatory risks including from foreign governments our ability to comply with any such regulations will impact the success of any such acquisitions furthermore failure to realize the expected revenue increases cost savings increases in geographic or product presence andor other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations new lines of business and new products and services are essential to our ability to compete but may subject us to additional risks we continually implement new lines of business and offer new products and services within existing lines of business to offer our customers a competitive array of products and services the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services such as the rapid adoption of mobile payment platforms the effective use of technology can increase efficiency and enable financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs however some new technologies needed to compete effectively result in incremental operating costs our future success depends in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations many of our competitors because of their larger size and available capital have substantially greater resources to invest in table start table end technological improvements we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could cause a loss of customers and have a material adverse effect on our business at the same time there can be substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets for such services are still developing in developing and marketing new lines of business andor new products or services we may invest significant time and resources initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business andor new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service furthermore any new line of business andor new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations de novo operations often involve significant expenses and delayed returns and may negatively impact wintrusts profitability our financial results have been and will continue to be impacted by our strategy of branch openings and de novo bank formations we expect to increase the opening of additional branches and may under certain circumstances resume de novo bank formations it may take longer than expected or more than the amount of time wintrust has historically experienced for new banks andor banking facilities to reach profitability and there can be no guarantee that these branches or banks will ever be profitable moreover the fdics enhanced supervisory period for de novo banks of three years including higher capital requirements during this period could also delay a new banks ability to contribute to the companys earnings and impact the companys willingness to expand through de novo bank formation to the extent we undertake additional de novo bank branch and business formations our level of reported net income return on average equity and return on average assets will be impacted by startup costs associated with such operations and it is likely to continue to experience the effects of higher expenses relative to operating income from the new operations these expenses may be higher than we expected or than our experience has shown which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations legal and regulatory risks if we fail to meet our regulatory capital ratios we may be forced to raise capital or sell assets as a banking institution we are subject to regulations that require us to maintain certain capital ratios such as the ratio of our tier capital to our riskbased assets and in recent years these regulatory and market expectations have increased substantially if our regulatory capital ratios decline as a result of decreases in the value of our loan portfolio or otherwise we may be required to improve such ratios by either raising additional capital or by disposing of assets if we choose to dispose of assets we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so at prices that we believe to be appropriate and our future operating results could be negatively affected if we choose to raise additional capital we may accomplish this by selling additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock which could significantly dilute the ownership percentage of holders of our common stock and cause the market price of our common stock to decline additionally events or circumstances in the capital markets generally may increase our capital costs and impair our ability to raise capital at any given time changes in the united states monetary policy may restrict our ability to conduct our business in a profitable manner our ability to profitably operate is dependent in part upon federal fiscal policies that cannot be predicted we are particularly affected by the monetary policies of the federal reserve which influence money supply in the united states any change in the united states monetary policy or worsening federal budgetary pressures could affect our access to capital additionally any trend toward inflation economic decline destabilizing of financial markets or other factors beyond our control may significantly affect consumer demand for our products and consumers ability to repay loans reducing our results of operations the federal reserve raised interest rates significantly and continued to shrink its assets during in response to persistently high inflation measures that were well above the federal reserves two percent target while the federal reserve has indicated that it may seek to lower interest rates in the near term during the range of potential rate paths over the coming year is wide and likely will ultimately be driven by the path of inflation labor market performance and economic growth sustained higher interest rates and continued federal reserve asset reductions may adversely affect market stability market liquidity and table start table end our financial performance and condition we cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies or the precise effects that future changes in monetary policies may have on our activities and financial results legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future regarding the financial services industry may significantly increase our costs or limit our ability to conduct our business in a profitable manner we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations can be substantial and adversely affect our ability to operate profitably while we are unable to predict the scope or impact of any potential legislation or regulatory action until it becomes final it is possible that changes in applicable laws regulations or interpretations thereof could significantly increase our regulatory compliance costs impede the efficiency of our internal business processes negatively impact the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets require us to increase our regulatory capital interfere with our executive compensation plans or limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner including our plan for de novo growth and growth through acquisitions both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which our business is subject have increased in recent years in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector many of these changes have occurred as a result of the doddfrank act and its implementing regulations most of which are now in place we expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision in addition we expect that the biden administration will continue to seek to implement a regulatory reform agenda this reform agenda could include a heightened focus on the regulation of loan portfolios and credit concentrations to borrowers impacted by climate change heightened scrutiny on bsa and aml requirements topics related to social equity executive compensation and increased capital and liquidity as well as limits on share buybacks and dividends in addition mergers and acquisitions could be dampened by increased antitrust scrutiny we also expect reform proposals for the shortterm wholesale markets at this time we are unable to assess which or to what extent these policies will continue to be implemented and what their impact on the companys business financial condition or results of operations would be moreover uncertainty as to the outcome of national elections in late increases the risk of uncertainty as to whether regulatory reform will continue we are subject to complex and evolving laws regulations rules standards and contractual obligations regarding data privacy and cybersecurity which could increase the cost of doing business compliance risks and potential liability we are subject to complex and evolving laws regulations rules standards and contractual obligations regarding data privacy and cybersecurity including in relation to the personal information of customers employees or others and any failure to comply with these laws regulations rules standards and contractual obligations could expose us to liability andor reputational damage as data privacy and cybersecurity risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years data privacy and cybersecurity issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus as new data privacy and cybersecurityrelated laws regulations rules and standards are implemented the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws regulations rules and standards as well as our potential liability for noncompliance and reporting obligations in the case of cyberattacks information security breaches or other similar incidents may significantly increase compliance with these laws regulations rules and standards may require us to change our policies procedures and technology which could among other things make us more vulnerable to operational failures and to monetary penalties for breach of such laws regulations rules and standards in addition to various data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations already in place us states are increasingly adopting laws and regulations imposing comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity obligations which may be more stringent broader in scope or offer greater individual rights with respect to personal information than federal or other state laws and regulations and such laws and regulations may differ from each other which may complicate compliance efforts and increase compliance costs certain aspects of federal and state laws and regulations relating to data privacy and cybersecurity as well as their enforcement remain unclear and we may be required to modify our practices in an effort to comply with them further while we strive to publish and prominently display privacy policies that are accurate comprehensive and compliant with applicable laws regulations rules and industry standards we cannot ensure that our privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be sufficient to protect us from claims proceedings liability or adverse publicity relating to data privacy or cybersecurity although we endeavor to comply with our privacy policies we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so the publication of our privacy policies and other documentation that provide promises and assurances about data privacy and cybersecurity can subject us to potential federal or state action if they are found to be deceptive unfair table start table end or misrepresentative of our actual practices additional risks could arise in connection with any failure or perceived failure by us our service providers or other third parties with which we do business to provide adequate disclosure or transparency to our customers about the personal information collected from them and its use to receive document or honor the privacy preferences expressed by our customers to protect personal information from unauthorized disclosure or to maintain proper training on privacy practices for all employees or third parties who have access to personal information in our possession or control any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies or applicable data privacy and cybersecurity laws regulations rules standards or contractual obligations or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to or unauthorized loss destruction use modification acquisition disclosure release or transfer of personal information may result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices the expenditure of substantial costs time and other resources proceedings or actions against us legal liability governmental investigations enforcement actions claims fines judgments awards penalties sanctions and costly litigation including class actions any of the foregoing could harm our reputation distract our management and technical personnel increase our costs of doing business adversely affect the demand for our products and services and ultimately result in the imposition of liability any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations for more information regarding data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations see protection of client information under supervision and regulation in item financial reform legislation and increased regulatory rigor around consumer protection and mortgagerelated issues may reduce our ability to market our products to consumers and may limit our ability to profitably operate our mortgage business the cfpb has broad rulemaking authority over a wide range of federal consumer protection laws applicable to the business of our subsidiary banks and some other operating subsidiaries including the authority to prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices but examination and supervision of our subsidiary banks is carried out by the primary federal banking agency and where applicable state banking agencies consumer protection is an area of significantly heightened regulatory focus and the cfpb has promulgated a number of specific regulatory requirements and regulatory guidance in this area these actions have increased and may further increase the costs of doing business for all market participants including our subsidiaries in particular the mortgagerelated rules issued by the cfpb have materially restructured the origination servicing and securitization of residential mortgages in the united states these rules have impacted and will continue to impact the business practices of mortgage lenders including the company for example in order to ensure compliance with mortgagerelated rules issued by the cfpb the company consolidated its consumer mortgage loan origination and loan servicing operations within wintrust mortgage the cfpb and federal and state banking agencies also closely examine the mortgage and mortgage servicing activities of depository financial institutions should these or other agencies have serious concerns with respect to our operations in this regard the effect of such concerns could have a material adverse effect on our profits table start table end federal state and local consumer lending laws may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans and could increase our cost of doing business federal state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain lending practices considered predatory these laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers repeatedly refinancing loans and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property the cfpb has promulgated many mortgagerelated rules since it was established under the doddfrank act including rules relating to the ability to repay loans and relating to qualified mortgage standards most of these mortgagerelated rules have been adopted although portions of certain of these rules have not yet become effective in addition several proposed revisions to mortgagerelated rules are pending finalization we may find it necessary to tighten our mortgage loan underwriting standards in response to the cfpb rules which may constrain our ability to make loans consistent with our business strategies it is our policy not to make predatory loans and to determine borrowers ability to repay but the law and related rules create the potential for increased liability with respect to our lending and loan investment activities they increase our cost of doing business and ultimately may prevent us from making certain loans and cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that we do make in addition regulation related to redlining fair lending cra compliance and bsa compliance create significant burdens which necessitate increased costs any failure to comply with any of these regulations could have a significant impact on our ability to operate our ability to acquire or open new banks andor result in meaningful fines regulatory initiatives regarding bank capital requirements may require heightened capital the us basel iii rule as well as other aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to banking organizations have increased our compliance costs impacted the profitability of our business activities and may change certain of our business practices including the ability to offer new products obtain financing attract deposits make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads and could expose us to additional costs including increased compliance costs these changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply and could therefore also materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our ability to engage in capital distributions including paying dividends or repurchasing stock may be restricted if we do not maintain the required capital conservation buffer in addition we anticipate that our pro forma capital ratios will be an important factor considered by the federal reserve in evaluating whether proposed payments of dividends or stock repurchases are consistent with its prudential expectations for more information regarding capital requirements see capital requirements of the company and subsidiary banks under supervision and regulation in item our fdic insurance premiums may increase or the fdic could adopt additional special assessments either of which could negatively impact our results of operations the doddfrank act and fdic regulations use an assessment base for federal deposit insurance premiums based on average total consolidated assets less average tangible capital there is a risk that the banks deposit insurance premiums will increase in the future if failures of insured depository institutions once again deplete the dif additionally to recoup losses to the dif resulting from the bank failures of the fdic also adopted a special assessment that will become effective in and will be collected over eight quarterly assessment periods there is a risk that the fdic could adopt additional special assessments in the future to recoup future dif losses either of these events could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations for more information regarding the most recent increase to the banks deposit insurance premiums see insurance of deposit accounts under supervision and regulation in item noncompliance with the usa patriot act bsa or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions the usa patriot act and the bsa require financial institutions to develop riskbased compliance programs designed to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering the funding of terrorist activities or other illicit finance activities if such activities are detected financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with fincen the bsa and its implementing regulations require covered financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new accounts failure to comply with the bsa and its implementing regulations could result in fines or sanctions an increasing number of banking institutions have received large fines for noncompliance with the bsa and its implementing regulations although we have developed policies and procedures designed to table start table end assist in compliance with these laws and regulations no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations we are subject to claims and legal actions that could negatively affect our results of operations or financial condition periodically as a result of our normal course of business we are involved in claims and related litigation from our customers employees or other parties these claims and legal actions whether meritorious or not as well as reviews investigations and proceedings by governmental and selfregulatory agencies could involve large monetary claims and significant legal expense in addition such actions may negatively impact our reputation in the marketplace and lessen customer demand if such claims and legal actions are not decided in wintrusts favor our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted we are subject to examinations and challenges by tax authorities that may impact our financial results in the normal course of business we as well as our subsidiaries are routinely subject to examinations from federal and state tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments we have made and the businesses in which we have engaged recently federal and state tax authorities have become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions these tax positions may relate to among other things tax compliance sales and use franchise gross receipts payroll property and income tax issues including tax base apportionment and tax credit planning the challenges made by tax authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions if any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations changes in federal and state tax laws and changes in interpretation of existing laws can impact our financial results given the changing economic and political environment and ongoing budgetary pressures the enactment of further new federal or state tax legislation may occur the enactment of such legislation or changes in the interpretation of existing law including provisions impacting tax rates apportionment consolidation or combination income expenses credits and exemptions may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations changes in accounting policies or accounting standards could materially adversely affect how we report our financial results and financial condition our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial results and financial condition some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results some of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions if such estimates or assumptions underlying our financial statements are incorrect we may experience material losses from time to time the fasb and the sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes can be hard to predict and could materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements changes in us trade policies including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations there continues to be discussion and dialogue in the us government regarding potential changes to us trade policies legislation treaties and tariffs including trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries including china the european union canada and mexico and retaliatory tariffs by such countries tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed and additional tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been proposed additionally the us government has imposed certain economic sanctions and trade restrictions against certain other countries and could impose additional sanctions and trade restrictions such tariffs retaliatory tariffs sanctions or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers import or export could cause the prices of our customers products to increase which could reduce demand for such products or reduce our customers margins and adversely impact their revenues financial results and ability to service debt this in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on the markets in which we operate our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted it remains unclear what the us government or foreign governments will or will table start table end not do with respect to tariffs already imposed additional tariffs that may be imposed or international trade agreements and policies risks related to lending operations if our allowance for credit losses is not sufficient to absorb losses that may occur in our loan portfolio our financial condition and liquidity could suffer we maintain an allowance for credit losses that is intended to absorb expected lifetime credit losses related to our loan portfolio offbalance sheet credit exposures and heldtomaturity debt securities portfolio at each balance sheet date our management determines the amount of the allowance for credit losses based on our estimate of expected credit losses over the life of the related asset with consideration of historical credit losses current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts because our allowance for credit losses represents an estimate of lifetime losses there is no certainty that it will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in the portfolios particularly if there are changes in expectations of general economic or market conditions or events that adversely affect specific customers in we charged off million in loans net of recoveries and increased our allowance for credit losses from million at december to million at december our allowance for loan and unfunded lendingrelated commitment losses represented and of total loans outstanding at december and respectively although we believe our allowance for credits losses is adequate to absorb estimated credit losses in our loan portfolio if our estimates are inaccurate and our actual credit losses exceed the amount that is anticipated or if the forecasts and assumptions used in calculating our reserves are significantly different from those we actually experience our financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected for more information regarding our allowance for loan losses see loan portfolio and asset quality under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item as a participating lender in the sba paycheck protection program ppp the company and its banks are subject to additional risks of litigation from the banks customers or other parties regarding the banks processing of loans for the ppp and risks that the sba may invalidate some or all ppp loan guaranties from april through the end of the program in the second quarter of we originated over ppp loans with a carrying balance totaling approximately billion as of december the carrying balance of such loans was reduced to approximately million primarily resulting from forgiveness by the sba the ppp program expired on may although the remaining carrying balance of our ppp loans is relatively low there remains a risk that the company and its banks could be subject to risks of litigation from the banks customers or other parties regarding the ppp loans as well as risks that the sba may invalidate some or all ppp loan guaranties and seek recoupment any financial liability litigation costs or reputational damage caused by ppp related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally participating banks also have credit risk with respect to ppp loans if a determination is made by the sba that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated funded or serviced by the banks such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a ppp loan which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws rules and guidance regarding the operation of the ppp in the event of a loss resulting from a default on a ppp loan and a determination by the sba that there was a deficiency in the manner in which a ppp loan was originated funded or serviced by the company the sba may deny its liability under the guaranty reduce the amount of the guaranty or if it has already paid under the guaranty seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the company a significant portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of commercial loans the repayment of which is largely dependent upon the financial success and economic viability of the borrower the repayment of our commercial loans is dependent upon the financial success and viability of the borrower if the economy weakens for a prolonged period or experiences deterioration or if the industry or market in which the borrower operates weakens our borrowers may experience depressed or dramatic and sudden decreases in revenues that could hinder their ability table start table end to repay their loans our commercial loan portfolio totaled billion or of our total loan portfolio at december compared to billion or of our total loan portfolio at december commercial loans are secured by different types of collateral related to the underlying business such as accounts receivable inventory and equipment should a commercial loan require us to foreclose on the underlying collateral the unique nature of the collateral may make it more difficult and costly to liquidate thereby increasing the risk to us of not recovering the principal amount of the loan accordingly our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected by defaults in this portfolio a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate in particular commercial real estate deterioration in the real estate markets could lead to additional losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as of both december and approximately and respectively of our total loan portfolio was secured by real estate the majority of which is commercial real estate the commercial and residential real estate markets continue to experience a variety of difficulties including the chicago metropolitan area and southern wisconsin in which a majority of our real estate loans are concentrated continued uncertainty in economic conditions may impair a borrowers business operations slow the execution of new leases and lead to existing lease turnover as a result of these factors vacancy rates for retail office and industrial space may increase and hotel occupancy rates may decline high vacancy and lower occupancy rates could also result in rents falling the combination of these factors could result in the deterioration in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market and the deterioration in value of some of our loans any such deterioration could adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to repay the amounts due under their loans specifically the office property segment which represents of our total loan portfolio is undergoing a structural shift given the rise of a remote work environment resulting in heightened vacancies and potentially reduced leasing needs it is anticipated that this heightened risk environment for the office segment may take several years to resolve increases in commercial and consumer delinquency levels or declines in real estate market values would require increased net chargeoffs and increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations additionally any formal or informal action by our regulatory supervisors may require us to take increased reserves on these loans and could affect our share price as a result of the risks associated with commercial real estate banking regulators give greater scrutiny to lenders with a high concentration of commercial real estate in their portfolios and such lenders are expected to implement stricter underwriting internal controls risk management policies and portfolio stress testing as well as maintain higher capital levels and loss allowances concentrations in commercial real estate are monitored by regulatory agencies and subject to especially heightened scrutiny both on a public and confidential basis regulators may require banks to maintain elevated levels of capital or liquidity due to commercial real estate concentrations especially if there is a downturn in our local real estate markets events impacting collateral consisting of real property could lead to additional losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations many of the loans in our portfolio are secured by real estate located in the chicago metropolitan area any declines in economic conditions including inflation recession unemployment changes in securities markets or other factors impacting these local markets could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations deterioration in the real estate markets where collateral for our mortgage loans is located could adversely affect the borrowers ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral securing the loan and in turn the value of our assets in addition any natural disasters or severe weather events have the potential to damage our real estate collateral climate change could have an impact on longerterm natural weather trends and increase the occurrence and severity of such adverse weather events any inaccurate assumptions in our analytical and forecasting models could cause us to miscalculate our projected revenue capital liquidity or losses which could adversely affect our financial condition we use analytical and forecasting models to estimate the effects of economic conditions on our loan portfolio and probable loan performance those models reflect certain assumptions about market forces including interest rates and consumer behavior that may be incorrect if our analytical and forecasting models underlying assumptions are incorrect improperly applied or otherwise inadequate we may suffer deleterious effects such as higher than expected loan losses lower than expected net interest income lower than expected liquidity lower than expected capital or unanticipated chargeoffs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations table start table end we are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities a significant portion of the companys loan portfolio is secured by real property in the ordinary course of business the company may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans in doing so there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties if hazardous or toxic substances are found the company may be liable for remediation costs as well as for personal injury and property damage in addition we own and operate a number of properties that may be subject to similar environmental liability risks environmental laws may require the company to incur substantial expenses and could materially reduce the affected propertys value or limit the companys ability to use or sell the affected property the costs associated with investigation and remediation activities could be substantial in addition if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property although the company has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and results of operations risks related to our niche businesses our premium finance business may involve a higher risk of delinquency or collection than our other lending operations and could expose us to losses we provide financing for the payment of property and casualty insurance premiums and life insurance premiums on a national basis through first insurance funding and wintrust life finance respectively and financing for the payment of property and casualty insurance premiums in canada through our whollyowned subsidiary fifc canada property and casualty insurance premium finance loans involve a different and possibly higher risk of delinquency or collection than life insurance premium finance loans and the loan portfolios of our bank subsidiaries because these loans are issued primarily through relationships with a large number of unaffiliated insurance agents and because the borrowers are located nationwide as a result risk management and general supervisory oversight may be difficult as of december we had billion of property and casualty insurance premium finance loans outstanding of which billion related to the companys us operations at first insurance funding and million related to the companys canadian operations at fifc canada together these loans represented of our total loan portfolio as of such date first insurance funding and fifc canada have in the past been susceptible to and may in the future be more susceptible to third party fraud with respect to property and casualty insurance premium finance loans because these loans are originated and many times funded through relationships with unaffiliated insurance agents and brokers acts of fraud are difficult to detect and deter and we cannot assure investors that our risk management procedures and controls will prevent losses from fraudulent activity wintrust life finance may be exposed to the risk of loss in our life insurance premium finance business because of fraud while wintrust life finance maintains a policy prohibiting the known financing of strangeroriginated life insurance and has established procedures to identify and prevent the company from financing such policies wintrust life finance cannot be certain that it will never provide loans with respect to such a policy in the event such policies were financed a carrier could potentially put at risk the cash surrender value of a policy which serves as wintrust life finances primary collateral by challenging the validity of the insurance contract for lack of an insurable interest see the below risk factor widespread financial difficulties or credit downgrades among commercial and life insurance providers could lessen the value of the collateral securing our premium finance loans and impair the financial condition and liquidity of first insurance funding wintrust life finance and fifc canada for a discussion of further risks associated with our insurance premium finance activities while first insurance funding and wintrust life finance are licensed as required and carefully monitor compliance with regulation of each of their businesses there can be no assurance that either will not be negatively impacted by material changes in the regulatory environment fifc canada is not required to be licensed in most provinces of canada but there can be no assurance that future regulations which impact the business of fifc canada will not be enacted table start table end additionally to the extent that affiliates of insurance carriers banks and other lending institutions add greater service and flexibility to their financing practices in the future our competitive position and results of operations could be adversely affected wintrust life finances life insurance premium finance business could be materially negatively impacted by changes in the federal or state estate tax provisions there can be no assurance that first insurance funding and wintrust life finance will be able to continue to compete successfully in its markets widespread financial difficulties or credit downgrades among commercial and life insurance providers could lessen the value of the collateral securing our premium finance loans and impair the financial condition and liquidity of first insurance funding wintrust life finance and fifc canada first insurance funding wintrust life finance and fifc canadas premium finance loans are primarily secured by the insurance policies financed by the loans these insurance policies are written by a large number of geographically dispersed insurance companies our premium finance receivables balances finance insurance policies that are spread among a large number of insurers however one of the insurers represents approximately of such balances and two additional insurers represent approximately each of such balances first insurance funding wintrust life finance and fifc canada consistently monitor carrier ratings and financial performance of our carriers while first insurance funding wintrust life finance and fifc canada can mitigate risks as a result of this monitoring to the extent that commercial or life insurance providers experience widespread difficulties or credit downgrades the value of our collateral will be reduced first insurance funding wintrust life finance and fifc canada are also subject to the possibility of insolvency of insurance carriers in the commercial and life insurance businesses that are in possession of our collateral if one or more large nationwide insurers were to fail the value of our portfolio could be significantly negatively impacted a significant downgrade in the value of the collateral supporting our premium finance business could impair our ability to create liquidity for this business which in turn could negatively impact our ability to expand our wealth management business in general and wintrust investments brokerage operation in particular exposes us to certain risks associated with the securities industry our wealth management business in general and wintrust investments brokerage operations in particular present special risks not borne by community banks that focus exclusively on community banking for example the brokerage industry is subject to fluctuations in the stock market that may have a significant adverse impact on transaction fees customer activity and investment portfolio gains and losses likewise additional or modified regulations may adversely affect our wealth management operations each of our wealth management operations is dependent on a small number of professionals whose departure could result in the loss of a significant number of customer accounts a significant decline in fees and commissions or trading losses suffered in the investment portfolio could adversely affect our results of operations in addition we are subject to claim arbitration risk arising from customers who claim their investments were not suitable or that their portfolios were inappropriately traded these risks increase when the market as a whole declines the risks associated with retail brokerage may not be supported by the income generated by our wealth management operations risks related to financial strength and liquidity changes in prevailing interest rates could adversely affect our net interest income which is our largest source of income we are exposed to interest rate risk in our core banking activities of lending and deposit taking since changes in prevailing interest rates affect the value of our assets and liabilities such changes may adversely affect our net interest income which is the difference between interest income and interest expense our net interest income is affected by the fact that assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change net interest income represents our largest component of net income and was billion and billion for the years ended december and respectively each of our businesses may be affected differently by a given change in interest rates for example we expect that the results of our mortgage banking business in selling loans into the secondary market could be negatively impacted during periods of rising interest rates whereas falling interest rates could have a negative impact on the net interest spread earned on deposits as we would be unable to lower the rates on many interest bearing deposit accounts of our customers to the same extent as many of our higher yielding asset classes additionally increases in interest rates may adversely influence the growth rate of loans and deposits the quality of our loan portfolio loan and deposit pricing the volume of loan originations in our mortgage banking business and the value that we can recognize on the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market table start table end in response to inflationary forces in the federal reserve raised its target for the federal funds rate several times beginning from a range of and ending at a range of at year end though we expect the federal reserve to slow the rate of increases we cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies or the precise effects that they may have on our activities and financial results for more discussion of this issue see the above risk factor changes in the united states monetary policy may restrict our ability to conduct our business in a profitable manner we seek to mitigate our interest rate risk through several strategies which may not be successful with the relatively low interest rates that prevailed in recent years we were able to augment the total return of our investment securities portfolio by selling call options on fixedincome securities that we own we recorded fee income of approximately million million and million for the years ended december and respectively we also mitigate our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps and other interest rate derivative contracts from time to time with counterparties to the extent that the market value of any derivative contract moves to a negative market value we are subject to loss if the counterparty defaults in the future there can be no assurance that such mitigation strategies will be available or successful or that we will be successful in implementing any new mitigation strategies necessary to address the current rising interest rate environment in addition transactions entered into as part of mitigation strategies employed to mitigate risks associated with a prolonged low interest rate environment could be less beneficial or result in losses if interest rates continue to rise our liquidity position may be negatively impacted if economic conditions do not improve or if they decline liquidity is a measure of whether our cash flows and liquid assets are sufficient to satisfy current and future financial obligations such as demand for loans deposit withdrawals and operating costs our liquidity position is affected by a number of factors including the amount of cash and other liquid assets on hand payment of interest and dividends on debt and equity instruments that we have issued capital we inject into our bank subsidiaries proceeds we raise through the issuance of securities our ability to draw upon our revolving credit facility and dividends received from our banking subsidiaries our future liquidity position may be adversely affected by multiple factors including if our banking subsidiaries report net losses or their earnings are weak relative to our cash flow needs if it is necessary for us to make capital injections to our banking subsidiaries if changes in regulations require us to maintain a greater level of capital as more fully described below if we are unable to access our revolving credit facility due to a failure to satisfy financial and other covenants or if we are unable to raise additional capital on terms that are satisfactory to us weakness or worsening of the economy real estate markets or unemployment levels may increase the likelihood that one or more of these events will occur if our liquidity is adversely affected it may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength may cause others to reduce or cease doing business with us which could result in a decrease in our net interest income and fee revenues our customers rely upon our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us if we experience diminished financial strength or stability actual or perceived including due to market or regulatory developments announced or rumored business developments or results of operations or a decline in stock price customers may withdraw their deposits or otherwise seek services from other banking institutions and prospective customers may select other service providers the risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is increased in the current market environment where the consolidation of financial institutions including major global financial institutions is resulting in a smaller number of much larger counterparties and competitors as our community banks become more closely identified with the wintrust name the impact of any perceived weakness or creditworthiness at either the holding company or our community banks may be greater than in prior periods if customers reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services that we provide them net interest income and fee revenues will decrease accordingly and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations loss of deposits or a change in the deposit mix could increase our funding costs deposits are a low cost and stable source of funding wintrust competes with banks and other financial institutions for deposits and as a result wintrust could lose deposits in the future clients may shift their deposits into higher cost products or wintrust may need to raise interest rates to avoid deposit attrition funding costs may also increase if lost deposits are replaced with table start table end wholesale funding higher funding costs reduce wintrusts net interest margin net interest income and net income any of a variety of single or combined factors could contribute to adverse movement in deposits or deposit costs including but not limited to economic uncertainty rapid movements in market interest rates or the federal reserves monetary policy entrance of competitors disruptive technology or decreased confidence in wintrust or the banking industry if our credit rating is lowered our financing costs could increase as of december we have been rated by fitch ratings as bbb and dbrs as a low a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization our creditworthiness is not fixed and should be expected to change over time as a result of company performance and industry conditions we cannot give any assurances that our credit ratings will remain at current levels and it is possible that our ratings could be lowered or withdrawn by fitch ratings or dbrs any actual or threatened downgrade or withdrawal of our credit rating could affect our perception in the marketplace and our ability to raise capital and could increase our debt financing costs if our growth requires us to raise additional capital that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high we are required by regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations see the above risk factor legal and regulatory risks if we fail to meet our regulatory capital ratios we may be forced to raise capital or sell assets and as we grow internally and through acquisitions the amount of capital required to support our operations grows as well we may need to raise additional capital to support continued growth both internally and through acquisitions any capital we obtain may result in the dilution of the interests of existing holders of our common stock our ability to raise additional capital if needed will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time which are outside our control and on our financial condition and performance the interest rate environment disruptions in financial markets negative perception of our business or our financial strength or other factors may impact our ability to raise additional capital when needed or on terms acceptable to us for example in the event of future uncertainty in the banking industry or other idiosyncratic events there is no guarantee that the us government would invoke the systemic risk exception create additional liquidity programs or take any other action to stabilize the banking industry or provide liquidity any diminished ability to access shortterm funding or capital markets to raise additional capital if needed could subject us to liability and our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and our financial condition and liquidity could be materially and negatively affected disruption in the financial markets could result in lower fair values for our investment securities portfolio the companys availableforsale debt and trading securities as well as certain equity securities are carried at fair value accounting standards require the company to categorize these securities according to a fair value hierarchy as of december approximately of the companys availableforsale debt securities and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value were categorized in level or of the fair value hierarchy meaning that their fair values were determined by unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets quoted prices for similar assets or other observable inputs significant prolonged reduced investor demand could manifest itself in lower fair values for these securities and may result in recognition of an otherthantemporary or permanent impairment of availableforsale debt securities and unrealized losses of equity securities with a readily determinable fair value recognized in earnings which could lead to accounting charges and have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operations the remaining securities in our availableforsale debt securities and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value portfolios were categorized as level meaning that their fair values were determined by inputs that are unobservable in the market and therefore require a greater degree of management judgment the determination of fair value for securities categorized in level involves significant judgment due to the complexity of factors contributing to the valuation many of which are not readily observable in the market in addition the nature of the business of the third party source that is valuing the securities at any given time could impact the valuation of the securities consequently the ultimate sales price for any of these securities could vary significantly from the recorded fair value at december especially if the security is sold during a period of illiquidity or market disruption or as part of a large block of securities under a forced transaction table start table end there can be no assurance that decline in market value of availableforsale debt securities and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value associated with these disruptions will not result in credit or permanent impairments and unrealized losses respectively of these assets which would lead to accounting charges which could have a material negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are a bank holding company and our sources of funds including to pay dividends are limited we are a bank holding company and our operations are primarily conducted by and through our operating banks which are subject to significant federal and state regulation cash available to pay dividends to our shareholders repurchase our shares or repay our indebtedness is derived primarily from dividends received from our banks and our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries is restricted various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends our banks can pay to us without regulatory approval the banks may not pay cash dividends if that payment could reduce the amount of their capital below that necessary to meet the adequately capitalized level in accordance with regulatory capital requirements it is also possible that depending upon the financial condition of the banks and other factors regulatory authorities could conclude that payment of dividends or other payments including payments to us is an unsafe or unsound practice and impose restrictions or prohibit such payments our inability to receive dividends from our banks could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations risks related to general operations our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls over financial reporting disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however welldesigned and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition our operational or security systems networks or infrastructure or those of third parties could fail or be breached which could disrupt our business and adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition as well as cause legal or reputational harm the potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our business and as a result of our interactions with and reliance on third parties is not limited to our own internal operational functions our operational and security systems networks and infrastructure including our computer systems and networks data management and internal processes as well as those of third parties are integral to our performance we rely on our employees and third parties in our daytoday and ongoing operations who may as a result of human error misconduct malfeasance or failure or breach of our or of thirdparty systems or infrastructure expose us to risk for example our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely in addition our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to thirdparty systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems moreover technological or financial difficulties of one of our thirdparty vendors or their subcontractors could adversely affect our business to the extent those difficulties results in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by an affected vendor our financial accounting data processing backup or other operating or security systems networks and infrastructure or those of third parties may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services such events may include sudden increases in customer transaction volume electrical telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages natural disasters such as earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes and floods disease pandemics and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters including wars and terrorist acts in addition we may need to take our systems or networks offline if they become infected with malware or a computer virus or as a result of another form of cyberattack information security breach or other similar incident in the event that backup systems are utilized they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been saved to backup systems potentially resulting in a temporary or permanent loss of such data our business recovery plan may not be adequate and may not prevent significant interruptions of our operations or substantial losses we frequently update our systems to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with all applicable laws rules and regulations this updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and networks and integrating them with existing ones including business interruptions implementation and testing of controls related to our computer systems and networks security monitoring and retaining and training personnel required to operate our systems also entail significant costs table start table end we may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of disruptions to or failures of our operational and security systems networks and infrastructure or those of third parties and our insurance coverage may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from such disruptions or failures disruptions or failures in our business structure or in the structure of one or more of our thirdparty vendors could interrupt the operations or increase the cost of doing business the occurrence of any disruptions or failures impacting our or our thirdparty vendors operational or security systems networks or infrastructure could result in a loss of customer business and expose us to additional regulatory scrutiny civil litigation and possible financial liability any of which could adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition as well as cause reputational harm we face risks from cyberattacks information security breaches and other similar incidents that could result in the disclosure of confidential and other information including personal information all of which could adversely affect our business or reputation and create significant legal and financial exposure our computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties on which we are highly dependent are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyberattacks information security breaches and other similar incidents our business relies on the secure processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential personal proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to access our network products and services our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks we our customers regulators and other third parties including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have been subject to and are likely to continue to be the target of cyberattacks information or security breaches and other similar incidents these may include among other things computer viruses malicious or destructive code phishing attacks denial of service or information ransomware malfeasance or improper access by employees or vendors attacks on personal email of employees hacking terrorist activities identity theft social engineering credential stuffing account takeovers insider threats human error fraud or other similar incidents that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse misappropriation loss disclosure or destruction of confidential personal proprietary and other information of ours our employees our customers or of third parties damage to our systems and networks or other material disruption of our or our customers or other third parties network access or business operations as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls processes policies and other protective measures we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss cybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions for example cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobilepayment and other internetbased product offerings and expand our internal usage of webbased products and applications in addition cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime affiliates terrorist organizations hostile foreign governments nation states nation statesupported actors disgruntled employees or vendors activists and other external parties including those involved in corporate espionage even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise targeted social engineering attacks and spear phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent in such an attack an attacker will attempt to fraudulently induce colleagues customers or other users of our systems and networks to disclose sensitive information including confidential personal proprietary and other information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients persistent
