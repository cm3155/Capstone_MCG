conference call over to mr edward wehmer edward joseph wehmer president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thanks very much happy new year everybody and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call with me as always is dave dykstra our chief operating officer kate boege our general counsel and dave stoehr our cfo today wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 well go through the same format as usual im going to give some general comments regarding our results turn it over to dave for a more detailed analysis of other income other expenses and taxes back to me for some summary comments and thoughts about the future and then time for questions id like to first take a little walk down memory lane as we enter the roaring twenties id like to think as we call them now and i think its appropriate to take a second to look at our accomplishments over the last decade as we have always been a company that manages for the long term i find it refreshing not always to concentrate on the last quarter look at an entire body of work over that longer term i can actually say with confidence that our franchise has really never ever been in better position or more valuable over that 10year period net income grew from million in to million in a net of compound annual growth rate out of years were record earnings with only not achieving record status earnings per share tripled during that period of time with a little over now over resulting in cagr tangible book value grew at cagr from in to almost in assets and deposits have both grown at compound annual growth rate assets tripled during that timeframe from billion to billion and the deposits from billion to billion loans grew from billion to billion from yearend to nonperforming assets as the percent of assets have come down every year since and ended this year at a low of total assets given our run rate in eps and our track record consistent growth and all fundamental financial results it kind it just drives me nuts to look at the discount that we traded at relative to the market our goal for and beyond is to continue this history of good growth in all major statistics barring material future decreases material decreases in rates this per share run rate is kind of a line in the sand for us and the basis for growth our future growth aspirations now onto the quarter the fourth quarter net income all in all is somewhat disappointing but reasonable considering the interest rate environment headwinds that we experienced i actually think since were going to have a period of what i consider a normal yield curve for maybe an aggregate of to months i dont really know what the new normal is anymore but it makes a little bit hard to manage our balance sheet but i think weve done a pretty good job over those years net interest income and net interest margin as you know they then fell basis points to as earning asset yields fell basis points and interest expense fell basis points the net free funds ratio was down by basis points all these differences are a direct result of the libor market and the yield curve ph targeting some material changes which should be a good basis for us going forward loan yields fell basis points loans heldforsale fell basis points the liquidity management yields fell basis points drop in liquidity management yield was due to the million increase in average liquidity management assets due to a good growth during the quarter this increase is yet to be invested in the longer term securities as evidenced by our liquidity management duration staying constant at a little rough four years investing these assets on securities longerterm securities should assist as part of the margin contribution going forward our goal is to maintain an approximate sixyear duration on liquidity management assets we have some opportunity there our loan to deposit ratio remained at the high end of our estimated to range in the quarter at down from in the previous quarter end and interest expense growth deposit expense decreased basis wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 points in the quarter generally it takes time to decrease deposit rates and we are actively and aggressively working to decrease the cost of funds at our deposit base so theres opportunity here also our overall cost of funds and total interestbearing liabilities was also down basis points on the net interest income front we recorded a decrease of about million the margin decrease was a primary result of this decrease and was mitigated by overall asset growth the full year basis net interest income was up approximately million going forward depending on the rate environment further rate cuts are actually ph not going to be appreciated we expect the margins to be under decreased pressure due to our ability to deploy liquid management assets in the higher yielding securities and aggressive deposit cutting costs cost cutting where we can we know libor is again down this quarter we think weve been aggressive and hopefully our plan is to have a decrease in any future decrease in assets offset by liabilities and the cost of liabilities going down so again we think were kind of at a good point here barring an overall shift down materially in a quick shift down materially in the market net interest income should grow as a result of the above plus additional gain in franchise growth we strongly believe the current should be a baseline of which we can build and grow especially we can maintain our historical growth asset growth rates in other income and other expense dave will be reviewing these in detail a bit later but some high level remarks net overhead ratio stood at for the quarter for the year if one were to eliminate the msr valuation adjustments and acquisitionrelated expenses would it be a bit below our goal as an organization if we were to omit the negative msr valuations for the year we would achieve approximately earnings growth for the year under the balance sheet where assets grew billion over the year billion over september and ph during assets about billion in the quarter and billion for the year and loans were up billion for the quarter and billion for the year so good loan growth across the board with the start of the year with a little bit of a head start with almost million of average assets the average assets being below quarterend assets so thats a good thing so the net of loans heldforsale grew billion or for the quarter and approximately billion or for the year fourth quarter included approximately million in acquired loans real estate loans commercial and residential grew million in total premium finance loans life and pc grew million and commercial loans increased by million loan pipelines continue to remain strong across the board we expect to continue growing loans at highsingle digits ph as a percent consistent with prior periods deposit front was another great deposit growth quarter of billion thats after returning million audio gap acquisition accounted for approximately half of this net growth in deposits core deposits nonbrokered comprise of total deposits i think we have the best core franchise in our market continued good growth is at the heart of our plans for and beyond good credit front as mentioned credit metrics returned to historical norms nonperforming stayed constant and totaled about outstanding which is low as theyve been in any recent time in the past same could be said for nonperforming assets as i said earlier its decreased to of assets net chargeoffs were million including million in charges previously reserved for despite our second quarter blip the net chargeoffs for the year totaled just around basis points a good number in anyones wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 measure and more in line with what you would expect from us at wintrust we continue to cull the portfolio for prime assets high leverage deals are not welcome here anymore and we are moving them out as we can but we want to find them before they become problems of moving about and moving them out on an expeditious basis im going to turn over to dave who will provide some additional details on our income and expense he will also give you detail on the longawaited cecl or the convoluted i call it the convoluted ill tell you later in the call now dave go ahead david l stoehr chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp all right thanks ed as normal ill briefly touch on the other noninterest income and noninterest expense sections as well as the convoluted cecl standard that ed referred to on the noninterest income section our wealth management revenue increased million to a record million in the fourth quarter compared to million in the third quarter of this year and up from the million recorded in the year ago quarter overall we believe the fourth quarter of was another solid quarter for wealth management segment benefiting from good customer growth and a strong equity market mortgage banking revenue declined by or million to million in the fourth quarter from million recorded in the prior quarter and was up a strong from the million recorded in the fourth quarter of last year the decrease in this categorys revenue from the prior quarter resulted primarily from seasonally lower levels of loans originated and then sold during the quarter from basically lower purchased home activity offset somewhat by an msr adjustment during the fourth quarter which was positive versus the negative fair value adjustment recognized on msrs in the prior quarter the company originated approximately billion of mortgage loans for sale in the fourth quarter this compares to billion of originations in the third quarter of this year and million in the fourth quarter of last year the mix of loan volumes originated for sale that was related to refinance activity was approximately compared to in the prior quarter so the refinance volume increased during the quarter and acted to mitigate the seasonally lower purchased home activity table of our earnings release provides a detailed compilation of the components of origination volumes by delivery channel and also the mortgage banking revenue including production revenue msr capitalizations msr fair value and servicing income we currently expect originations in the first quarter of to be stronger than the first quarter of given the continuation of the refinance activity but the originations are expected to be less than the fourth quarter so somewhere between first quarter last year and fourth quarter of last year is where we currently expect the volumes to be other noninterest income totaled million in the fourth quarter down approximately million from the million recorded in the third quarter of this year the primary reasons for the low revenue in this category include million of lower swap fee revenue and million less of income from investments and partnerships these investment and partnerships are primarily related to sbic investments to support our cra goals this category of revenue generally fluctuates as a result of the two revenue sources i just talked about and has averaged about million over the past five quarters so despite falling from a very good third quarter level the current quarter is roughly on average with the last five quarters wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 turning to noninterest expense categories noninterest expense totaled million in the fourth quarter up approximately million or from the prior quarter a number of factors contributed to the increase the first severance payments professional fees and data processing conversion charges related to the recent acquisitions totaled approximately million during the fourth quarter compared to million in the third quarter approximately million of other normal operating expenses related to the stc and countryside bank acquisitions were incurred during the quarter and we would expect that this amount would reduce over time as we continue to integrate these acquisitions into our infrastructure costs associated with terminating two small pension plans that we inherited with prior acquisitions totaled and that should be the end of any cost associated with pension plans as we no longer have any there was a increase in legal settlement charges in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter as management deemed it more cost effective to settle certain litigation matters than to hinder into potentially lengthy court proceedings million of additional expense was accrued as additional contingent purchase price payments related to prior mortgage operation acquisitions we have contingent consideration on our mortgage acquisitions and we have to make our best guess upfront and if the mortgage market is better you may have to record additional expense but if it was worse it could come in as income given the stronger mortgage market we recorded an accrual for million for what we think would be additional contingent purchase price payments on those mortgage operations and we also had million of less rebates on fdic insurance assessment this quarter compared to the prior quarter ill talk more significant the more significant categories now the salaries and employee benefit category increased approximately million in the fourth quarter from the third quarter of this year salary expenses accounted for almost all the increase was approximately million resulting was up approximately million resulting from approximately million of staffing costs related to the stc capital bank and countryside bank acquisitions completed during the fourth quarter plus an additional million of severance accruals and then also normal growth of the company accounted for the growth in that category additionally employee benefits expense was approximately higher in the current quarter than the prior quarter and this was really all due to the cost associated with terminating the two pension plans equipment expense totaled million in the fourth quarter an increase of million as compared to the third quarter the increase in the current quarter relates primarily to expenses associated with two acquisitions closed during the quarter and increased software depreciation and licensing as we continue to invest in information technology information security and the newlyimplemented bank secrecy act software which enhances our ability to monitor for bsarelated activities as we continue to grow occupancy expense totaled million in the fourth quarter increasing million from the prior quarter the increase was due to the costs associated with new locations of the acquired institutions new branch locations and increased real estate tax assessments data processing expense increased approximately million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter to primarily to approximately of conversion charges related to the stc capital bank system conversion and additional operating costs of data processing related to the two acquisitions that we closed during the quarter and just general growth of the franchise during the quarter fdic insurance expense was up million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter as you know the fdic insurance assessment regulations provided that after the reserve ratio reach the fdic would wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 automatically apply small bank credits to reduce small banks regulatory regular deposit insurance assessments up to the full amount of their assessments or to the full amount of their credits whichever is less the reserve ratio reached ph on june and stayed above the required threshold on september and since each of our subsidiary banks are less than billion in assets each of them qualified for the credit therefore wintrust bank received credits of approximately million in the fourth quarter which was approximately million less than the million of credits received in the prior quarter and so the accounts were basically all of the quarterly increase in the expense we believe we have about of additional assessment credit that could be applied in the future we expect those to come in the first quarter generally if the reserve ratio remains above the required threshold miscellaneous expense category totaled million in the fourth quarter compared to million in the third quarter an increase of approximately million the increase was impacted by the aforementioned legal settlement charge and million of expense accrued as the contingent purchase price payments on the mortgage acquisitions that i discussed in this category was also negatively impacted by approximately million of temporarily increased telecommunication charges as were converting and upgrading our systemwide telecommunication infrastructure and data network infrastructure so as we get off of one provider and go to another provider and invest in that system weve kind of got overlapped on the two providers as we are converting other than the expenses categories just discussed all the other expense categories were down on an aggregate basis by just over million from the third quarter of the net overhead ratio for the fourth quarter stood at on top of the acquisitionrelated and other uncommon charges mentioned at the beginning of my comments the net overhead ratio would have been below and we expect it to be below for the year and before i turn it back over to ed ill briefly comment on the implementation of cecl our estimated increase in the allowance for credit losses as a result of the implementation of cecl is in the to range this range reflects the uncertainty of economic forecasts that will be used to record the transition amount approximately of the estimated increase is related to additions to the existing reserves for unfunded lending commitments to the consideration under cecl of expected utilization by the companys borrowers over the life of those commitments as well as for acquired loans which previously considered credit discounts we expect relatively modest increases in reserves on the remaining legacy book as to future provisioning it will continue to be impacted by chargeoffs loan growth the mix of loan growth the macroeconomic environment and many other factors if the macroeconomic environment stays stable with our current assumptions and if we have loan growth similar to prior quarters and chargeoffs remain low then i expect our quarterly provision for credit losses to be in the million to million range but i caution that cecl accounting standard may cause significant volatility in the future and that estimate may be high or low my thoughts are that investors should focus on trends in nonperforming loans and net chargeoffs rather than provision expense under cecl the provision expense will be sensitive to economic forecasts that may or may not ultimately have a significant impact on the performance of the companys loan portfolio so as you may imagine im not a big fan of the new cecl accounting standard as the cost benefit aspect of it in my opinion is way out of whack and i believe itll create a fair amount of volatility going forward but weve got a great team thats worked hard on implementing the new accounting standard and we are ready to go wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 so with that i will conclude my comments and throw it back over to ed edward joseph wehmer president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thanks for the convoluted comments dave david l stoehr chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp youre welcome ed edward joseph wehmer president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well youre always good at being convoluted and shifting talks about the future although the rate environment provides a plethora of challenges we believe that we will navigate through the storm as we have in the past overall organic growth and acquisitive growth will be important as we need to grow this period of challenging rate environment decreasing our cost of funds is obviously a priority and were all over it loan pipelines remain strong interesting to note that weve been able to hold rates on our commercial premium finance business and our leasing business so we should hold in well deploying our liquidity management assets into longerterm betterearning assets is part of what were doing as i mentioned taking our duration from four to six years will be helpful there we have the expectation of a continued strong mortgage market we will be maintaining a positive gap so as to knock in we dont last thing we want to do is lock in this the margin we want to build off of that but were going to manage the downside risk a little bit more accurately than we have in the past credits always a big question it looks pretty good right now we could you never know we will never kick the can down the road when it comes to credit but so again continued good core franchise growth will be the key we have closed the stc transaction and the countryside transaction in the fourth quarter together these deals added close to million in total assets significant cost outs will happen but theyre going to take a few quarters to achieve we have converted stc and were starting to well close three branches there over a period of time possibly four that should start happening in the first and second quarter well be converting countryside in the second quarter therell be some expenses associated with that conversion but then we can start really taking the cost out of that too so we should have elevated costs from them in the first two quarters but that should be decreasing were not at a loss for future acquisition opportunities as the pipeline remains relatively full we may id like to advise that maybe some larger transactions and those that we have historically been involved with are now more of a possibility so we get bigger i think we can look at bigger deals and i think the pricing on the bigger deals might make more sense were seeing smaller deals being priced relatively high right now i know that credit union is being involved but weve walked away from two or three in the past three weeks of the quarter as a result of pricing being going up on them or they could just be two drunks holding each other i dont know whats going on but well find out in the long term and god willing we look forward to reporting record results in as always you can ensure of our best efforts in that regard now we can open up for questions wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets your line is now open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning edward joseph wehmer a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp how are you doing indiscernible jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc good ed you had some tongue twisters in the script so were going to get you off script now but your favorite topic the percentage margin i guess i was surprised to see the billion in loan growth and net interest income down a bit im just curious if anything surprised you guys in that percentage margin print and can you talk a little bit more about your confidence in seeing that margin stabilize at the number because things look good except for the fact that just that net interest income number didnt grow during the quarter edward joseph wehmer a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah i can understand that but now we got about million carry over to this quarter so on an average basis we werent up that much so thats some of the issue there so youll see that i think the with capital we can grow net interest income next year if we can maintain our steady growth rates as to deposits i think you got libor down or maybe basis points really in this quarter but were actively cutting expenses our interest expense so we can bring that down by the same level knowing that our premium finance loans on the commercial side and our billion leasing portfolio continues to maintain the rates and putting the liquidity to work we hope that this is the base we can work off of as our numbers show us i can see gradual improvement but it keeps going down i mean its hard to catch up well eventually we will but right now it appears that if it just stays right where it is or drops or basis points a quarter we can handle that and use this relatively speaking as our benchmark to go forward dave you got a comment david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp yeah no i just the key is i think going to be the 30day libor rate and whether that stabilizes or not and the feds rate if they hold stable if those two hold stable then i think we can hold and weve got a good baseline and the growth looks great growth in net interest income so lets hope the yield curve steepens and the 30day libor anchors out here wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right and then the other obviously bigger line item you talk about a lot is mortgage and you had a good mortgage quarter and this kind of what you did a year ago sounds like youre still reasonably optimistic even though i think we all expect  to be down a bit but talk a little bit about what youre thinking about  and then your ability youve talked about the efficiency efforts in mortgage and your ability to get cost down if we do see the seasonal slowdown and also some slowdown in the refi david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp yeah well i said in my comments that i think the mortgage production right now based on what were seeing and you dont have full visibility for the quarter because the loans close sort of in that to 40day period so not sure what the end of the quarter is going to look like and where rates will go in the next few weeks but based upon the application and the pipelines we have and the forecasts that we have we think the production will be somewhere between what we did in the first quarter of last year and what we did in the fourth quarter so first quarter last year we did million or im sorry million worth of production and we did billion this quarter my guess is its somewhere in that million plus or minus range but thats our best estimate right now it could change if the rates fall and that refinance activity picks up even more but my guess is its somewhere in that range jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then the efficiency piece of it david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp yeah well we continue to work on that as weve talked before we have offshored some of the activities that are noncustomer facing that are more unit priced and so weve turned that more into variable versus fixed rate and we continue to invest in the technology so i look at this as just an evolving improvement in the expense line items as we continue to get better theres not going to be one big quarter where expenses drop were just getting better and better and better each quarter so we should see some continued improvement there jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes okay and then just one more and ill step back just the comment about bigger deals ed what do you mean by that do you mean youd consider an moe do you mean just bigger than these subbilliondollar transaction youve historically done just what do you mean by those comments thanks edward joseph wehmer a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well obviously weve concentrated on banks under billion well continue to look at that but looking at banks over billion makes some sense to us also right now given that many of them are having kind of the same issue as we are wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 on the moe standpoint theres lots of opportunity that we dont generally comment on anything particular going on or discussions that are going on or not going on but you can imagine that in a year like this everybody kind of going through this through this same sort of margin compression issues that some things might make some sense but things we never looked at before id just stay on that but who knows jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thanks edward joseph wehmer a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah operator our next question comes from terry mcevoy with stephens your line is now open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi thanks for taking my questions to start off with a question on the expenses dave you ran through a lot of the fourth quarter puts and takes to the expenses could you just provide some thoughts on the first quarter will some of those expenses kind of disappear and but you also have some seasonality that typically shows up in the first quarter as well david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp yeah well the fdic credits of million are going to go down to so therell be a little headwind on that certainly the legal settlements of roughly million this quarter we dont expect to happen again pension termination of million we dont expect to happen again the contingent consideration on the mortgage purchase price estimate we think weve accrued that up so we wouldnt expect that to happen again acquisitionrelated charges of million as ed said we dont expect much in the first quarter but we will convert the countryside deal in the second quarter so well have some additional charges then when that happens but that should be mostly in the second quarter and so i mean those were the big items that i dont think should recur going forward you also note that on the noninterest income side there is a million swing between third quarter and fourth quarter on swap fees that fluctuates quartertoquarter we had abnormally good third quarter and a drop a little bit in the fourth quarter given the rate environment and the like but that very well could get better and then the partnership investments generally those are positive we had a couple of these sbic investment firms have rolled off some investments inside of their funds during the fourth quarter which negatively impacted us so i dont expect that to happen again but that was a million swing so theres between those two line items there was million swing that we dont expect to happen again sort of in the noninterest income side of the equation but those are volatile and we just have to see what the market value of those funds do and what the customer appetites are for sort of the capital market swap issues but those are the large items that i think you could sort of adjust for going forward wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 i do think then that commissions expense if were less in mortgage originations as i spoke about in the first quarter a little bit that the commission expense line item will come down so that should help on the salary side too terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks and then ed just a followup on the ma question you said times tangible book is ma really an option at all given call it the currency be it small banks or larger banks edward joseph wehmer a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp its all relative david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp yeah youll just have to look at what the price is on their side and some of these small deals are even larger deals if you can get enough cost outs out of them then if you look at the relative price and the cost savings you can make some of them potentially make sense edward joseph wehmer a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah were pretty good stewards of tangible book value we dont give away the house and expect a 10year earn back or something but hopefully it wont be a times in tangible book when you guys do your job out there just kidding so you think at i mean as a run rate per share the average indiscernible which should be traded i mean we get this quarterly knee jerk reaction that everybody thinks the world is coming to an end and nobody likes banks indiscernible but we think the market is pretty good we this rate environment i think we can hold pretty steady and continue to grow as i said earlier i think our franchise value has never been higher than it is right now when you look at the core deposits and our great customer base our growth its we feel pretty good about that aspect of it so yeah you never know but you never know done work is done work but everybody else is in the same boat in terms of book value book value numbers and earnings numbers were only indiscernible turns off the market actually we made up lots of cost cuts too we can do acquisitions we can do them well were not going to do anything stupid so done work is done work but to saying that the odds are that looking at larger deals might make more sense than some of the smaller deals for the reasons i discussed earlier terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks for your thoughts operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw your line is now open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 great thanks ed youve talked about this number a couple of times on the call today im trying to get a sense as in is your expectation that youll do better than that in barring any changes by the fed is that the message youre trying to send edward joseph wehmer a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah i think its a base were going to build off of i think if we can continue to grow at the rate weve been growing at we grew billion organically and a billion through acquisition last year well just grow on billion would be a good number for us and hopefully we can beat that the earnings on that if we can hold our margins steady and keep the costs down that has a commensurate increase in expenses which we fully expect to have well get our overhead ratio in the consistently i think will be okay christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and just maybe i missed it i think you talked about your margin was the comment that the rate of compression will abate from this quarter or that will hold kind of from here edward joseph wehmer a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well both it just depends on where libor continues to tank itll be hard to hold it but i think that rate of compression should slow down even it does go down more than we expect but basis points to basis points we should be able to hold that just through the through extending our maturities on our liquidity management portfolio and continuing to cut our cost of funds but any like a quarter sudden drop of basis point sudden drop would have a negative effect on us christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc but as it stands today with libor down what basis points a quarter you think youll be in that ballpark of for the first quarter if everything stay the same edward joseph wehmer a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yes sir and build off christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it edward joseph wehmer a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp of that going christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 okay maybe the second question weve seen a lot of banks given the revenue pressures kind of go to the expense well obviously you guys have a growth aspect to the story but what are the thoughts of really ratcheting up the efforts to cut costs while the revenue pressures are there edward joseph wehmer a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp we do that all the time i mean the efficiencies we look for those all the time we have a whole process here we go through in terms of looking at process efficiencies and a number of those are in the works right now we continue to go through that and work through it but we also have to make investments in it and technology that were doing its people so we look at it all the time i dont know exactly what we could do to really do a drastic cut on expenses right now and continue to grow the organization we have to take what the market gives us the market has given us good organic growth right now we got good momentum in our markets good growth in our markets if i can continue to grow the franchise and keep in that overhead ratio at in the then the margin will come around eventually i mean it will steady and solidify at some point it cant go down forever maybe it will go up some day but ive given up on interest rates i dont think ive ever seen a period of time where full employment and gdp growth and absolutely no inflationary pressures how can maybe you can explain to me someday chris but i do know that i do not want to i do want to maintain a positive gap i want to stay interest rate sensitive maybe not as much as we were weve been whittling that back a little but because i dont want to lock in a margin for the next five years that doesnt make sense to me so lets see where it goes dave you got anything christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks operator our next question comes from brock vandervliet with ubs your line is now open brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for taking my question so as i look at your loan growth in the past acquisitions have always played a part of that as you look at kind of organic loan growth in what does that look like is that mid single digits higher than that edward joseph wehmer a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp i believe that a midsingle digit be a good number to somewhere in that number right around there david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp and sort of mid to highsingle digit is sort of the phrase i would use which would be to yeah wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and separately on expenses everyones kind of taking shots at this question and were still going through the adjustments but is a low per quarter base reasonable for expenses how should we think about that david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp theres so many variables out there depending on the mortgage market and the like i think what weve tried to do brock in the past is sort of focus on the net overhead ratio so you can take the noninterest income components and the noninterest expense components that are related to those so our goal in was sort of 155ish range for the full year as ed had mentioned previously we expect to get that down into the so it certainly will be below based on what were looking at now so were going to get expense leverage out of the system as we grow and thats how we look at it its probably a little higher than the if you take out some of the expenses we had this time but add back in the fdic credits its higher but youre going to come down on commissions in the first quarter so maybe you get into low but it really sort of depends on the mortgage market and what that does and so its hard i hesitate to give a number because it fluctuates based upon what were doing in the revenue section on some of these commissionbased businesses that we have so i would focus more on are you coming in with net overhead ratios for the year less than in the brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got you and appreciate the guide on provisioning going forward to a quarter how does that post cecl guide square with the million call it million in  david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp in  you have to remember we had a chargeoff that took away a specific reserve of million so that was a big part of the drop as we just didnt have that reserve for that one loan so brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay edward joseph wehmer a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah going forward we think as dave said earlier looking at i mean cecl is going to be all over the board on this and if the guy at moodys has a bad day or hangover or his hemorrhoids jacked up he could take the banking business down because everybody is using basically moodys baseline as their basis for this so i think you got to concentrate on net chargeoffs and changes in specific reserves thats what were doing here in our when we evaluate people because i mean this thing could go up and go down based on their whims so brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 operator our next question comes from david chiaverini with wedbush securities your line is now open david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks i wanted to follow up on the nim discussion you mentioned about how you may be able to defend the net interest margin at the level by extending the duration from four years to six years i was curious how much in yield pickup do you expect with extending the duration david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp well i think you just have to look whatever the overnight rate is and compare that to what a ginnie and a fannie rate is out in the marketplace so ginnies and fannies are in the mid right now and the overnight rates are mid so maybe pick up or so basis points if you get some agencies you could get closer to if you have callable agencies so you do some mix there but certainly pick up over basis points but it wasnt just that and so that plus the lowering of the deposit costs is what depends the margin david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc great thanks for that and you plan on extending that for the entire portfolio like roughly the billion on the securities edward joseph wehmer a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well the liquidity management includes the overnight funds david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp yeah you have to look if you look on our balance sheet weve got interestbearing deposits with banks of million billion of available for sales and the billion of held to maturity i mean thats already invested so weve got a little over billion of overnight money thats available to be invested plus whatever you could get out of growth of the balance sheet on the deposit side david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc got it edward joseph wehmer a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp the whole industry environment has been about a little over after tax on any spread we picked up i mean thats what were looking at why wed hesitate a little in the past but after tax would be good i mean by pretax would be but my goal is indiscernible thats a goal david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 yeah and thats why you havent seen us put a ton of money into it yet because the long end just hasnt provided that type of return and were hesitant to put billion to work at spreads less than that all at once and ive always said that the day we do that is the day that long end will shoot to the moon so well leg into this thing unless the long end really pops up dramatically david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thanks for that and then shifting to the loan growth and you mentioned about the mid to highsingle digit to i was curious just how are your borrower your commercial borrowers feeling nowadays do they feel in your discussions with them do they feel better about the economy with the trade deal the phase trade deal getting done im just curious as to what theyre saying edward joseph wehmer a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp theyre all feeling pretty good i mean theres not a day that goes by that a reasonably privately owned middle market company ph doesnt get offered a hell of a lot of money basically our ci portfolio was stagnant for the year that didnt mean we booked over billion worth of loans but theyre much in payoffs through some derisking so the portfolio we got rid of highly leveraged deals were getting out of that business and but theyre all feeling pretty good about what theyre doing and theyre all they may not be running that million backlog that they had so theyre all doing pretty well right now and they feel pretty good but theyre all so the money thats flying around out there right now from pe firms and fintech companies were seeing a lot of paydowns so they have to work really hard just to stay steady in that business fortunately if the fintech takes it over we do maintain the deposit accounts so thats a good thing so lets say the fintech takes over the loan so weve got to be careful because i had a company that cut their legs up against the wall in terms of leverage so its a tough market from a lender standpoint for the borrower standpoint theyre all feeling pretty good i would say david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc great thanks very much operator our next question comes from michael young with suntrust your line is now open michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey thanks for the question i wanted to followup on the share buyback that you announced and just kind of get your thoughts on how you were looking to deploy that obviously a lot of discussion of ma as well but just kind of how youre comparing and contrasting buying back your own stock versus looking at acquisitions david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp well we havent bought any stock back todate we have the tool available to us and we just we really compare and contrast the deal flow and what sort of returns we think we can get off of those versus the buyback were not wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2020 big fans of diluting tangible book value so given the pipeline of deals were looking at were going to see how some of those flow through and then well watch the stock price movement and compare them so havent done anything todate but we will continue to evaluate it versus the acquisitions but we just compare the two and maybe thats why were losing some of the deals out there as ed said some of them are recently have had very high price expectations and were very judicious in what we do we dont need to do a billion billion billion billion bank if it cost too much theres just no reason to overpay were looking at it for the longterm value of the shareholder so if those dont pan out then you would probably see us look a little harder at the stock buyback michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay go ahead ed edward joseph wehmer a president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp if the market tell you what its just a matter its just numbers as dave said if the deals were looking at visà vis capital and where multiples are i said were at a share return times times multiple situations so we were always good stewards of capital we use it accordingly but there comes a time where buying it back was obviously better than buying a bank so it all just comes down out of graham dodd and cottle basic finance book michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc and just as a followup dave with the limiting capital ratio this point be total capital ratio is that what we should watch david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp yes sir thats always been our limiting ratio michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thank you operator im showing no further questions in queue at this time id like to turn the call back to mr wehmer for closing remarks edward joseph wehmer president chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thanks everybody
