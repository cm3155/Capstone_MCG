wintrust financial corp good morning everybody and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call with me always are dave dykstra dave stoehr kate boege tim crane and rich murphy well have the same format as we usually as we adopted earlier in the year seems to go pretty well ill give some general comments regarding our results turn it over to tim for more detail on the balance sheet turn it over to dave dykstra whos going to talk about other income and expense and murph will then follow up with the discussion on credit then back to me for some summary comments about the future and then time for questions as many of you already know december marked the 30th anniversary of us opening our first bank little more than million in capital raised from friends neighbors and family hardy souls embarked on the journey with absolutely no delusions of grandeur our goal was simple to create a new type of community bank one that combined high touch banking with technology ie high tech high touch to our people and businesses in the communities we serve all along at the center of our homegrown all along the center of our homegrown culture in four pillars our shareholders employees customers and communities we serve we never wavered from that commitment in the years weve been in existence of course this anniversary ive been asked many times what im most proud of about wintrust is it the employees who make up wintrust yeah im pretty proud of that is it the billion in banking assets and billion of wealth management assets weve amassed over the years yeah im pretty proud of that too is it the record earnings we have delivered over the years yes in fact our stock price quote is it the fact that out stock price quote the century mark feel pretty good about that too many of those attributes i am very proud of however the one im most proud of is the fact our culture has endured over that period culture dedicated doing the right thing for our constituents all the time take the blame share the fame and avoid the shame and enjoy the game our culture in a nutshell have endured even though we have grown beyond our wildest dreams so enough with the walk down memory lane lets talk about the quarter and yeartodate results all in all another very successful quarter previous calls i referred to around as billion quarters this one is different its a billion quarter assets rose billion to billion growth or billion versus december core loans net of ppp and loans held for sale went to billion billion for the quarter growth or about billion billion deposits were billion a billion growth for the quarter or billion up to december loan growth was enhanced by the purchase of portfolio of agency loans from allstate approximately million tim will talk about this a little bit more on the balance sheet front our strategy which we adopted the start of the pandemic in april of growing through the period and enhancing our interest rates in todays position has paid off in spades mortgage and ppp loans took us through the depth of the pandemic our growth in core loans has more than replaced the earnings power these assets are extremely well positioned for higher rates they appear to be here finally ph paul harvey page sic on the earnings front we recorded record year million or per diluted common share fourth quarter recorded income million or per diluted common share indiscernible from the third quarter mainly because of the positive position provision million as opposed to the negative provision of almost million positive provision was brought about by the acquisition the double accounting we have to do there and the fact that our growth loans have grown so nicely wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 net income interest income was up million compared to  core net interest income is up million and it appears the ppp contribution was down million earning asset well basically loan levels the 5basispoint decline in deposit costs was a modest change loan pipelines remain consistently strong whilst we start the nice head start is ending loan balances to december average loans about billion line utilization was up a smidge thats kind of a smidge is a technical term we use around here but not close to historical averages but well discuss it murph will talk about this in detail i mean theres over billion of loan growth if and when utilization return to normal nim was down slightly basis points due to its additional liquidity indiscernible you can expect us to begin vesting our excess liquidity current duration on our liquidity portfolio is a little over three years opposed to a normal sixplus years well be prudent in our investment timing though credit quality got even better believe it or not murph will also cover this in his review of credit however ill note that we did conduct an asset sale noted in the release ph if we needed to call the portfolio and get rid of bad assets potentially bad assets as soon as possible ptpp pretax preprovision income was up approximately million to million we expect indiscernible to grow nicely in especially when rates rise is anticipated more on this in my closing remarks one last point i want to make is our wealth management business assets under administration were up almost billion in the quarter approximately billion in the yearoveryear to billion or growth rate as we see the market obviously has done a good core growth and account and our account total is impressive fee run rates went from an annualized million in the fourth quarter of ph million in the fourth quarter of yeah you got it i feel like joe biden there tims now going to talk for two hours very proud of the progress made in this year look forward to a continued growth in this area got a lot of momentum there ill turn it over to tim wholl take us through the balance sheet timothy s crane president wintrust financial corp great thanks ed id like to highlight a couple of balance sheet items as well as comment on a couple items likely to be of interest the billion in loan growth that ed referenced was spread nicely across all categories rich will add some color to that but it includes the million of loans from the previously announced november purchase of the allstate agency loans this portfolio is a very nice add to our existing agency lending business importantly unlike some loan portfolio purchases that run off over time this is a business that we believe we can continue to sustain and grow its also important to note that the overall loan growth does not yet include much benefit from increased line utilization where we only saw a modest improvement in the quarter on an annualized basis the loan growth for the quarter excluding the portfolio purchase and ppp was the third straight quarter at or above and ed mentioned that the period end loan balances were well above the quarter average balances obviously ppp loans continue to run off down a little over a billion in the quarter and now total million a number we expect to decline relatively quickly with continued forgiveness activity into we expect continued strong loan growth while our guidance remains our historical midtohigh single digit loan growth on a percentage basis net of ppp our shortterm performance should continue to be at or above the high end of that range and likely better than peers the billion of deposit growth just under half of that was noninterestbearing deposits and the rest at very low cost as a result interestbearing deposit costs wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 declined to basis points while we believe there is some continued room for decline the changes will be smaller going forward as the majority of deposits have repriced during the low rate cycle on the investment front we remained very liquid with approximately billion in liquidity at year end and securities balance is essentially flat while i expect we will begin to deploy some of the liquidity in the first part of at somewhat higher rates than we saw in the fourth quarter we remain cautious about locking in low long term yields and remain very wellpositioned for rates at higher levels on that topic anticipating a question or two about rising rates weve reported for several quarters that we have focused on remaining interest rate sensitive expecting the possibility of higher rates that continues to be the case and we will benefit from upward changes that the market is starting to price into the consensus forward curves just a couple of highlights reinforcing eds earlier comments approximately of our loans reprice within a year you can see this on page of the supplemental presentation our spreads simply our loan yields versus our deposit costs improved for the third straight quarter securities yields for many instruments are to basis points higher than they were even a month ago and while its slightly more complicated than this given loan floors loan indices deposit data and some competitor actions we believe each 25basispoint change in rates is worth about million to million in pretax net interest income on an annualized basis and youll see this in a paragraph on the second page of our press release the only thing that i would add is that early in the cycle deposit costs tend not to rise as rapidly as they may following subsequent later increases you can obviously do the math but our net interest margin for the quarter was down basis points attributed solely to the continued impact of more liquidity absent that excess liquidity our margin would have actually expanded by basis points without large continued inflows we expect the margin has bottomed and will certainly improve as rates begin to trend up going forward each 25basispoint increase in rates equates to approximately a 10basispoint improvement in margin and if and thats a big if the current consensus rate forecast plays out its conceivable margin will be around at yearend on the capital front the banks capital levels are down slightly as a result of the strong growth in the quarter but remain well within our targeted levels and appropriate on a riskadjusted basis lastly we continue to be very pleased by our market momentum last quarter we highlighted the favorable greenwich ratings and the satisfaction of our commercial clients i would add that wintrust ended as the top sba lender in illinois in terms of customer behavior we continue to see digital usage increase nicely and in we will continue to improve on our digital offerings with a near total revamp of our consumer and small business digital services in addition to our high tech improvements we will also enhance our high touch activities with the addition of locations in oak park illinois and rockford illinois both attractive markets where wintrust historically has had a limited presence as you can tell we feel very good about where we begin and with that ill hand it over to dave david alan dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp great thanks tim ill cover the noteworthy income statement categories starting with the net interest income some redundancy within tims comments here but well just go through it quickly for the fourth quarter of net interest income totaled million an increase of million as compared to the third quarter of and an increase of million as compared to the fourth quarter of wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 the million increase in net interest income in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to average earning asset growth which was up on an annualized basis over the prior quarter net interest margin declined basis points to basis points a beneficial decline of basis points for the rates paid on liabilities was offset by a 7basispoint decline on the yield on earning assets and a 3basispoint decline in the net free funds contribution resulting in the decline in the reported net interest margin the yield on earning asset decline in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter as tim said was almost entirely due to the shortterm liquidity build that we had during the quarter and the decline in the interestbearing liability rate was primarily associated with a 5basispoint decline in our interestbearing deposits mostly due to the repricing of time deposits its important to note that the net interest income expanded despite the million less of interest income associated with the ppp portfolio in the fourth quarter and the net interest margin would have stayed relatively stable excluding the impact of the ppp portfolio and would be down only basis point as tim crane mentioned the margin was affected by this excess liquidity on our balance sheet and that the rates are higher than they were a month ago so as we begin to deploy some of that liquidity into the market we expect the net interest income and net interest margin to benefit from that although well continue to be cautious on deploying the liquidity turning to the provision for credit losses wintrust recorded a provision for credit losses of million compared to a negative provision of million in the prior quarter and a million provision expense recorded in the year ago quarter the provision expense in the fourth quarter was driven largely by loan growth excluding ppp loans of approximately billion including loans related to the acquisition of the insurance agency lending portfolio and also increased slightly due to a small rise in net chargeoffs offsets to those increases for the provision were improvements in the macroeconomic environment and in the loan portfolio characteristics during the quarter including improving loan risk rating migration rich will cover credit quality and additional detail on just a couple of minutes turning to the other noninterest income and noninterest expense sections in the noninterest income portion of the income statement our wealth management revenue increased million to another record level of million in the fourth quarter compared to million in the third quarter and up from the million recorded in the year ago quarter mortgage banking revenue saw a reasonably solid loan origination volume during the fourth quarter with lock adjusted origination volumes down approximately which was consistent with the guidance we provided in our prior quarters earnings release mortgage banking revenue decreased million to million in the fourth quarter revenue was lower in the current quarter primarily due to the lower lock adjusted origination volume and combined with slight compression in the related production margin the lower production revenue was partially offset by a favorable fair value adjustment of mortgage servicing rights the company recorded a positive million valuation adjustment in the fourth quarter of related to mortgage servicing rights compared to a decrease of in the prior quarter looking forward based on current market conditions we anticipate mortgage revenue excluding any msr valuation adjustments to be fairly similar in the first quarter of as we experienced in the fourth quarter of obviously the mortgage servicing rights valuation is tied closely to interest rates and were not going to wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 speculate on what those may be at the end of the first quarter of but based on current market rate conditions it would point to a higher valuation but obviously lots of time to go yet in the quarter other noninterest income totaled million in the fourth quarter of down approximately million from the million recorded in the prior quarter the two primary reasons for the lower revenue in this category include million of lower swap fee revenue and million of lower income from investments and partnerships which are primarily related to investments that we have to support our cre purposes in the noninterest expense categories noninterest expense stayed relatively stable with the past five quarters and totaled million in the fourth quarter up approximately million from the million recorded in the prior quarter there are a handful of categories that account for the majority of the change from the prior quarter that ill focus on but i think its important to put the expense growth in the context of the company growing its balance sheet by billion during the quarter salaries and employee benefits expense decreased by million in the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of the year the decline is primarily related to a million of lower compensation expense associated with mortgage banking commissions and incentive compensation program expense in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter with those savings partially offset by increased staffing costs as the company continues to grow software and equipment expense totaled million in the fourth quarter that was an increase of million as compared to the prior quarter the increase is primarily due to accelerated depreciation related to the reduction in the useful life of certain software that is planned to be replaced as we continue to upgrade our digital customer experience as well as increased expenses associated with upgrading our data centers and other software enhancements to support our growth ongoing digital enhancements and cybersecurity efforts oreo expenses were actually negative by approximately in the fourth quarter as the company recorded gains of approximately on sales of oreo properties these gains were in amounts that exceeded the aggregate cost of the oreo expenses and valuation charges on other oreo properties although this expense category was negative it was approximately less negative than the third quarter which also had gains on the sale of oreo properties i think its important to note that weve been aggressive in liquidating oreo assets and the amount of oreo on our balance sheet at the end of the year was a mere million compared to million at the end of the prior quarter and million at the end of other than the expense categories i just discussed no other expense category had a change of more than and all those other expense categories in the aggregate were up less than million compared to the third quarter of the net overhead ratio a measure of operational efficiency remained relatively stable in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter the net overhead ratio stood at which is down basis point from the recorded in the third quarter and the ratio continues to benefit from strong balance sheet growth and good mortgage banking results the efficiency ratio also stayed relatively stable at approximately in both the third and the fourth quarters of the year so in summary the core fundamentals are strong with growth in pretax preprovision net income robust loan and deposit growth increased net interest income despite sizable ppp loan reductions another record wealth management revenue quarter seasonally adjusted strong mortgage banking revenues relatively stable net overhead and efficiency ratios strong pipelines and fantastic credit metrics wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 so with that ill turn it over to rich richard b murphy vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp thanks dave as noted earlier credit performance for the fourth quarter was very solid from a number of perspectives as detailed on slide of the deck loan growth for the quarter net of ppp was just over billion as tim noted that number included the allstate portfolio acquisition of million resulting in net loan growth of over billion equally as important and similar to the third quarter was the nature of this growth which was spread across our loan portfolio specifically wintrust life loans which were up million core ci loans which were up million first insurance funding which was up million in addition the assetbased lending group leasing and franchise teams all showed solid growth this quarters growth closed out a very productive year for wintrust where we saw net loan growth excluding ppp of billion billion if you net out the allstate acquisition an increase of for the year as noted in prior earnings calls we continue to see very solid momentum in our core ci portfolio pipelines have been strong throughout the year and we saw that materialize into increased outstandings during the past two quarters we continue to believe that ongoing market disruption and our success during ppp are the primary driving factors we are optimistic about loan growth in for a number of reasons core pipelines continue to be very strong line utilization as detailed on slide continues to trend up from to during this past year when netting out mortgage warehouse lines and we anticipate this trend will continue we have seen the average loan size in our first insurance portfolio grow by over this past year to and over in the fourth quarter we believe these levels will continue into and wintrust life finance had a very strong year growing their portfolio by this momentum was maintained through the fourth quarter and should continue into as a result as tim mentioned we are reaffirming our loan growth guidance of mid to highsingledigit growth through but we think our shortterm performance should continue to be at the higher end of that range and we should continue to outperform our peer group from a credit quality perspective as detailed on slide we continue to see solid credit performance across the portfolio this can be seen in a number of metrics nonperforming loans decreased from million or basis points to million or basis points a meaningful part of this reduction came from the sale of a million portfolio of loans the majority of these were nonperforming npls continue to be at recordlow levels and roughly half of where they were this time last year chargeoffs for the quarter were million approximately million of which was a result of the loan sale that we just discussed and we as dave pointed out we continue to see credit risk ratings show positive migration as our customers continue to recover from the pandemic that concludes my comments on credit and ill turn it back to ed to wrap up edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 thanks murph good job its amazing to be in the call our strategy has been to grow the balance sheet during the period of low rates use our structural hedges ie mortgages to buffer the loss of net interest income until such time as balance sheet growth can offset the income loss due to lower rates ppp loans were an expected benefit addon to this strategy indiscernible will be accomplished while enhancing our interest rate sensitivity position anticipation of higher rates which appeared to be on the nearterm horizon we have more than covered the ppp loan writeoff which was our goal with core loans its fair to say that to date the strategies have been accomplished in spades the excellent growth we have put up over this period and the allstate portfolio purchase has been organic other than the allstate portfolio purchase has been organic acquisition market appears to be getting more active but so our expectations and fairly high continue to evaluate opportunities in all areas of our business as they arise as you know we take what the market gives us and right now its given us great organic growth well continue our historic approach to potential deals where it makes sense as you all know im deathly allergic to earnings and book value dilution really well positioned whatever the market brings us credit metrics are at their lowest levels in years and pipelines remain consistently strong across the board we expect this to continue due to our reputation in the market the market disruption that is and will continue to take place diversified earning asset base continues to serve us well our line utilization should rise if inflation stays strong should be worth over billion of digital loan growth if utilization returns to historical levels should we expect wealth management revenue and assets to continue at their current glide path mortgages should continue to be meaningful but with lower contributions than in as we mentioned in previous comments our asset sensitivity position placed us in position taking advantage of the rising rates as tim said every points should add million to million to our net interest income on an annualized basis very much looking forward to seeing my beach ball i guess its been underwater for a long time we have the ability to put more of our liquidity use as rates rise weve already been lagging into this strategy were always and have always been a growth company and this has not changed i direct your attention to charts on pages through in the release the cagrs indicated on those charts are all of our vital statistics because that show our last years of work numbers would be similar if not better if you went back the entire years of our existence i put this body of work against any other bank in the country im very proud of our entire wintrust team who works so hard to make this happen i cannot wait to see what the next years bring with that ill turn it over to for questions wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning guys timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp hi jon edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp morning timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp how are you doing jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc good good congrats on the years ed and billion notable edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hard to believe isnt it jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hard to believe maybe tim or murph can you talk a little bit about the kind of late growth in the quarter and what you think drove that its a pretty good jumpingoff point for  but anything notable that youd call out on that richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp no i dont think so and i think if you look back at prior yearends youd see a similar phenomenon there is always a rush to get deals closed before yearend ci was up but again as i pointed out it goes really across categories and there was just a big rush also in the life finance area deals closing before the end of the year so i dont think its really atypical for a yearend but it was very pronounced this year we were earlier in the quarter we were commenting that we that the feedback we are getting was very solid performance for the quarter but we it wasnt materializing and then just really in december it really started to ramp up quite a bit and i really just think its a function of just that deadline of and the holidays and everybody just pushing things across the lines wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 and then the other thing is i think everybody was dealing with a fair amount of capacity issues from attorneys and appraisers and everybody else and that there was definitely a push at the end here to get things through the pipeline so other than that i dont know tim would you add anything timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp no i think that maybe a handful of people that thinking that they were going to complete some sort of transaction trying to get it in before some taxrelated activity might have come up but that turned out not to be the case jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc right timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp well see edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp turned out theres a lot of jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc so really no change in the pipeline indiscernible edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp a lot of things have been closed in the first quarter so timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp sorry jon we missed you there jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah just but youre still saying no real change in the pipeline despite that strength at yearend timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp no pipeline looks pretty strong jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay tim your comment on deposit costs not rising early in a rate hike cycle what point do you start to think about that or maybe said another way how much runway do you think you have in terms of your deposit betas timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah jon i think its going to be hard to tell because a lot of the market has a lot of liquidity right now and so unlike prior cycles where people might have been a little bit higher on the loantodeposit scale well just kind of have to see weve seen very little deposit competition so far and given the very low levels we start at the betas will obviously work themselves up over the cycle david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp i think jon this is dave i think if you look at the prior cycle we didnt see any rates in the first two right raises by the fed and you really only started to see pressure on the third rate hike of basis points so well just have to see the size and the timing of and what competition does but as tim said with all the liquidity in the market we wouldnt expect it to happen any faster than that we think it could potentially the betas could lag a little bit more than that given all the deposits in the system jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah it seems that way just a quick one for you dave on mortgage on your mortgage guidance youre saying start with the million production revenue number add servicing and then take our best shot at the msr valuations is that the right way to look at it david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah or the other way is just take the million of total mortgage banking revenue and whack off the million of msrs and say thats your base but jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay okay good thanks guys david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp just a point on that we think actual closed originations will probably be down just a little bit in the first quarter but we think the pipeline will build at the end of the quarter so if that happens the lockadjusted origination should be fairly similar and the revenue should be fairly similar wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thanks dave operator thank you our next question comes from david long of raymond james please go ahead david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp how are you doing david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good good you guys talked a little bit about the strong loan growth in the quarter but just curious if i can get a little bit more color on are these new relationships is utilization upticking where are these new loans coming from richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp yeah i think utilization as we talked about is up a little bit businesses are doing better and utilization is very real we have probably a ways to go there i think you had seen numbers closer to were at so i think theres still lots of a headroom there but i think in general thinking about the different loan products most of this is really coming as a result of market disruption in the ci space because we as weve talked about in prior calls i think we have really kind of become the bank in chicago to go to and you look at whats going on with cibc and some of the changes there you look at whats happened with mbfifth third and a lot of the changes there the first midwest acquisition theres just a lot of things that have gone on where decisions arent getting made locally anymore and weve always positioned ourselves as ed in the opening remarks talked about this is we are the we have always been the local alternative to the big banks we continue to be that and people do like that they like being able to walk in and meet with the people who are making the credit decisions making the people who are running the company it is a key differentiator and most of that is resulting in these new relationships coming over but then if you look at like the life portfolio thats all new relationships i mean that is just people that really like the product see how it fits into their estate planning and it has become a much more popular product in the industry and we are just capturing market share of that and getting more opportunities so it definitely is new relationships david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it and then on the deposit side sort of the same direction here but you had billion in growth in the quarter are these sticky deposits do you expect these to stay i know you talked about the deposit beta but will these deposits stay on the balance sheet do you expect a runoff at any point once rates start moving higher wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well i think you have a mix issue when rates are moving higher a bit but a lot just sits in demand right now but i believe well we dont know basically when people pull a lot of money out they all had a lot of cash if they pull it out will it come back to us probably but thats why were being a little bit slow on our we take this into consideration as we look into investing our excess liquidity tim you want to comment timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah ed i think thats all right that theres probably a little bit of taxrelated activity thatll occur in april obviously people have sold some businesses they have parked money for their tax obligations but we watch it very carefully david and well react appropriately it was a lot of growth david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it okay timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp a lot of growth david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc yes timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp so david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc yes definitely and then just finally indiscernible edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp this quarter david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc what was that ed edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 were hanging in there so far timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp right david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good good i may have missed this with daves discussion but were there any merger charges associated with the allstate portfolio that was purchased that were baked in the operating expense number in the quarter david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah it was a very small i mean we had legal fees associated with it david so i mean a very small amount less than million so nothing significant david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc great thanks guys appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from terry mcevoy of stephens your question please terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning how are you edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp very good terry how have you been terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc good thanks i went back it took you a decade to grow your deposits billion you crossed that mark in whereas you did that just in the last quarter so congrats on the fourth quarter i guess a couple of questions can you maybe how are you thinking about expense growth in a lot of talk of wage inflation but then on the flip side maybe a softer mortgage market will impact some of your salaries and benefits edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp dave david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah well i think that context is probably correct there ed i think the way we look at it and i will sound like a broken record compared to prior quarters is we try to focus on that net overhead ratio because the mortgage wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 business if it goes up and down the expenses go up and down and so we look at the operating leverage from that perspective it was in the low the last two quarters we expect to sort of hold that line a little bit if mortgages go down then its possible that that turns up into the basis points range so i think our target for net overhead ratio is still serving the basis point range but we expect to get leverage but there clearly is some pressure on wages out there but as you said if mortgage volumes are down then those commissions will be down and related expenses we also have those expenses supporting spread business right loans and deposits so as the spread business goes up theres a lot of builtin growth already actually for next quarter with over billion worth of ending earning assets over average and so those spread income will start to come through and the growth in the balance sheet will offset it so we do think therell be some pressure there but were also investing in robotic process automation in some areas so not that that necessarily would cut a bunch of positions but it would eliminate the need to add positions as we grow and so were going to be able to leverage technology and the like and so some of the digital enhancements were doing are going to reduce time to complete some functions in the organization which should also help let us leverage those technological advancements for growth so yeah there is pressure there but we also think theres leverage in the system and certainly if we dont think that our net overhead ratio targets are going up we think we can grow into any of those sort of increases and if theres a rate increase then that way more than offsets any pressure that you would have on those line items terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks for that dave and then just as a followup your commentary on bank ma a few years ago you were looking and talking about larger deals i guess is the message here youre going to take what the market gives you if something pops up or is there a bias towards a larger transaction and as you think about markets would you be willing to expand into a newer market edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp i really dont think weve changed were very opportunistic as it comes to acquisitions i cant though couple of quarters ago i thought that big bank kind of accounts there was just chum in the water see if i can get a shark up or a whale or a blowfish i dont know but i cant imagine us doing a bigger deal right now it drives me crazy we talk to people of all from billion and up all worried about themselves and not about their shareholders drives me nuts said that before ill say it again but were going to be opportunistic on it in terms of i cant imagine us doing a really large deal but i cant imagine us doing a deal that either in market or expanding the market to contiguous states i think northwest indiana is still in our bucket list we got to get there to expand in wisconsin and in the rest of illinois but we only have or market share here in chicago plenty of room for us to grow here as tim mentioned were opening up a couple of new branches new areas were not in theres a number of areas were still not in that were going to have to get to so well take what the market gives us i cant imagine well do a big deal but were always looking and well be very opportunistic but as i said im allergic to dilution and lets dave hes got a big epipen i dont think wed do a big deal that would dilute the crap out of us wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc appreciate that thank you edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp its intriguing that i could use an epipen on that but well wait for another day terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks operator thank you our next question comes from ben gerlinger of hovde group your line is open benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc morning guys edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp ben david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp good morning benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc i was curious you said in your opening remarks that every rate hike equates to about basis points of margin i was curious since you guys are so assetsensitive is there any part of that basis points thats got a delayed effect i mean for example if the markets pricing in a hike in march would you believe to see that basis points in the second quarter or is it potentially like immediately and following on david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well i guess what wed point to is just when we said in our so million to million over the next months and so i think its going to depend on competition on another other things how fast that builds in if its frontend loaded or not i think as tim indicated and based upon on earlier question that theres probably a lag in the deposit costs rise because of all the liquidity in the market which may be frontend loaded a little bit more but you could get an increase on your earning assets a little quicker than your deposits are going to reprice but theres so many moving parts to the equation and what could happen with the slope of the yield curve et cetera but i think our general guidance is good right now and well try to finetune it as rates go up but i think well just stick with what we gave you there wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you okay thats fair and then when you think about hiring and the potential for talent obviously expenses have increased industrywide in terms of a salary line and the guidance is even more just curious how you guys approach talent and the cost associated with that do you need to see revenue associated with the talent or is there supporting backoffices that could potentially also increase the salary line items timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp well i can take part of that and dave can add i mean we continue to believe were an attractive endpoint for bankers and revenue producers and rich talked about the disruption in the market that will drive that is there a little bit of pressure from a wage standpoint yes i dont think thats anything atypical from our standpoint at this point were generally hiring commercial bankers so we think the people are really important theyll help us continue to grow the company the back office side of things were doing a lot to limit the number of people we would need and the ability to scale up so therell be some impact but i dont think itll be outsized at this point david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah i think were always generally in the market for revenue producers timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp right david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp and so maybe that adds a little bit until they bring their book over with them but if we can hire good people that produce loans i mean were always investing in the business right so we would do that if theres good people and we always have for the last years so no change in that approach benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you okay i appreciate it thanks guys operator thank you our next question comes from brock vandervliet of ubs your line is open brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for the extra question i guess going back to i think it was david longs question on deposit trends youre kind of in line with other banks in terms of having vacuumed up or increased your deposit base since covid started have you have your bankers started engaging with large pools of deposits to try and get a sense of their stickiness or that or is that coming how are you trying to be the player coach in this and move into a higher rate environment wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well tim is in charge of stickiness indiscernible timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah sticky right its a good question and brock we actually have our structure is kind of wellpositioned to do that because each of our banks can reach out to their largest clients and sort of determine what their intentions are and as we did that in the fourth quarter we didnt see people reporting the large outflows or a large volatility and remember some of the deposit growth is actually consumerbased and related to new account activity and the stimulus payments and the like but were currently pleased that were up to about dda its obviously helpful to us going forward and a lot of it is related to the addition of new clients so to ed point eds point earlier we will watch for some volatility but we still think absent all of the noise we have and would have had very very strong deposit growth brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and separately ive been noticing this for a couple of quarters just in terms of wealth management it seems like many community even regional banks or larger banks struggle with wealth management its a product its a line item but it just doesnt move clearly not the case here and just if you were to kind of briefly summarize your gotomarket strategy there and why you think its distinctive versus what may be more traditional bank wealth offerings edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well it took a long time to get here that wealth management business is a tough business and maybe time we thought wed be there and need another piece finally by last year they said all the pieces are here feel like ph they want somebody to just talk about the bears at that time scared the hell out of me but theyve been able to go and build and grow i would say their approach to market is the same as ours its high touch high tech seems to me resonating well with the clients our name is out there a little bit more our size helps our reputation is out there and were doing a better job of crossselling so i dont know if well do anything different other than the fact that our products are good our service is good our name is good and thats how were doing it so one brick at a time brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay sounds good operator thank you our next question comes from chris mcgratty of kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 hey good morning as you mentioned ed or you dave mentioned the nim by the end of the year if the future is right im interested in what assumptions you may be making on just a mix of your balance sheet given the elevated cash in that assumption timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp chris its tim the assumption is that we deploy a little bit of liquidity and that we continue to get the growth that weve talked about part of it is obviously pure interest rate help as the various indices move but theyre pretty simplistic assumptions and the thing i think we just have to be careful is that there are a bunch of deposit indices and theres competitors in the mix and a number of other factors so we just want to be a little bit cautious in terms of forecasting what that might look like but were clearly positioned to benefit from rates up and expect that well get a nice lift christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay but that doesnt assume liquidity levels go to prepandemic levels thats just a slow gradual remix right timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah yeah david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah its not assuming like if youre wondering if it assumes all billion of excess liquidity goes to work its not doing that its a slow steady investment christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah it sounds good thank you maybe another question maybe for ed you guys have had a good history of having a pulse on big changes in the market i remember the financial crisis you guys pulled back everythings going really well right now whats the wall of worry if there is one edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp i dont know we worry about everything were basic oldtime bankers thats why at the end of my initial comments about we have to look at how we responded to everything from the great recession to the pandemic to also and during that period of time weve been able to maneuver and move very very quickly to react to that i think thats the same situation here we dont know what the market is going to give us but were going to take what it gives us not get greedy were diversified enough to know that if something isnt working we dont have to do that we could do something else well be working so i guess what i worry about most is will the deposits stay which im always worried about that loan quality cant be this good for i keep saying that but we are going to continue to call the portfolio and might even do another sale or so just to keep the numbers even lower so i dont know what do you guys think wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well i think that the worry when thats rates low for long i think the bigger concern was was there a race to the bottom on loan pricing because its better than fed funds concept i think with the perception now that rates are going up i think people arent kind of want to lock in those low loan rates but if for some reason we back to a low for long rate environment you worry that people just continue to price down the loan products but our pipelines and our ability to get loans on our pricing metric pricing matrix that we have as far as profitability weve been able to do it so youre worried about it but i think that worry is sort of goes away a little bit with rising rates because people dont lock in the lower spreads so i just hope they increase the rates but competition is something we will deal with all the time but as we saw in people race to the bottom on spreads and i was concerned that might happen but i think that concern is going away now richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp chris i maybe would add to what dave said i think that the old adage about the worst loans are made in the best of times its something that we the credit team here is constantly thinking about which is when theres so much liquidity in the marketplace you see banks doing irrational things and we just have to be constantly mindful that theres no loan out there that we absolutely have to do we have good loan growth if you just cant get there because somebody else is doing something stupid you just got to step away and we think weve made good prudent credit decisions but it is a very competitive market out there and as ed said credit cant stay this good forever and time will tell christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats great color thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from nathan race of piper sandler your line is open edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp nathan operator please make sure your line is unmuted and if youre on speakerphone lift your handset nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah apologies there i appreciate you guys taking the questions just going back to the excess liquidity deployment discussion just given the greater slope that we see in the yield curve of late is it maybe more of the willingness or sense of urgency to maybe put some liquidity to work in higheryielding securities in the first half of this year as opposed to maybe more of a laddered approach particularly just given the potential for the long end of the curve to flatten out as the fed raises shortterm rates and starts to unwind its balance sheet edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 its a great question if we are going to lag weve begun lagging into it a little bit we have plenty of liquidity to do all that so were going to take our time make sure that there is somebody said earlier make sure those deposits are going to stay the growth is there i worry about that a little bit but we have so many good sources of deposits not just our retail side but see that our deferred exchange is going to produce a lot of deposits both management produces lot of deposits so we have a really good diversified deposit source but anybody else timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp no i dont think theres a rush i think were patient and weve been rewarded a little bit as rates have moved quite a bit in the last month or so and as weve said were going to deploy some but i dont think were in a hurry nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp id love to use it via loan growth i mean and deploy it that way and see where deposits take us but thats our first choice edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah wed still like to deposits to your inventory we want to get more and more deposits i mean i have no problem with putting out deposits indiscernible liquidity just another lever we can pull when the time is right so we are very active in terms of getting more deposits for our customers and putting that out just because we have more inventory then david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah and i think nathan i dont think anybody can predict what that yield curve is going to do so if we invested it all right now i guarantee you the conventional ginnie mae would go up basis points in the next quarter so were going to a bit ladder it and see what the market gives i mean the market expectation for rate increases are completely different now than they were three quarters ago or two quarters ago so i dont think anybody knows what it does so we will take it over time and well be prudent but as tim says loans are the first choice and then well ladder into this liquidity and see where it takes us edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp i personally believe in this inflation as weve said all along its not transitory never was youre closer to a spiral anybody wants to tell who you are a quarter or half point youre going to cut it personally i dont know even a full point is it going to stop anything way too much liquidity the governments way too involved so i actually believe that youre going to see even higher rates that are coming down the pike but we will they are forecasted but thats my personal opinion we got to just be very prudent how we lay the money out you dont want to be going to lay it all out and then make a bet that way but were so well wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 positioned right now to take advantage of whatever the market brings us in pretty good shape so were going to leg into it and the timing will be somewhat staccato but well see david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp thats a great lever to have to pull edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah definitely i appreciate that color on a separate topic just thinking about mortgagerelated expenses and just kind of the outlook along those lines this year perhaps for dave if mortgage volumes are maybe half the level that we saw in the first quarter of is it as simple as kind of looking at the incentive comp line and assume that is also reduced by half or have there been other kind of implementations within the mortgage cost structure that could lead that expense bucket to be maybe a little more variable than what weve seen in the past from you guys as the volumes come down david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well i dont think its exactly linear i mean the spreads in the first quarter of last year were a lot higher so its our spread compression that revenue goes away but their commissions are based upon units not based on revenue so i dont think its linear because if you got into the higher production quarters margins were much wider and so its not quite linear but if you sort of normalize the production margins then i think you get closer to your concept but i think you have to take into account that under doddfrank you cant pay commissions based on the revenue you generate you have to pay commissions based on the units and so i think you have to normalize your revenue margins edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp which is why we always push to the overhead ratio its hard to know where theyre going to be but then that overhead ratio at current levels are one were expecting around david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp were this quarter but our target is really sort of to range edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah and if mortgages pick up that number will go down david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 but the other thing you can think of nate is msr is going to play into this too so if rates go up and our volume is down msrs are going to valuation is going to go up and our servicing portfolio continues to grow and so well have additional revenues off of that too so lots of moving parts there edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp i know you guys dont like to count the msrs nor do we but fact is it does add the earnings and capital and does add does help on the way up and hurts on the way down so nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co i guess im just kind of going back to a more normalized mortgage environment maybe in the first quarter of incentive comp was million or so and if you guys do a similar level volumes in the first quarter of this year is that kind of a good level to go off or have there been any kind of nuances within your mortgage structure that could cause those expenses to be more variable than what weve seen in the past david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp no i dont think weve really changed our comp structure there but you have to remember the incentive line in the press release includes bonuses and longterm incentive comp and commissions for wealth and mortgage and everything else its not just the mortgage line so nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it i really appreciate all the color thanks everyone edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of michael young of truist securities your line is open edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hello michael michael young q analyst truist securities inc hey thanks for taking the question happy years ed i want to call back a couple of your references and frame that into a question ph so just if starting off the year this year maybe pushing more of a beach ball up the hill what areas do you want to sort of reinvest in as some of the higher rates kind of pull through and really benefit the earnings stream wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well weve never stopped investing in the business i mean were a growth company you have to invest in the business weve always kept earnings growth tangible book credit growth in mind so we are going to continue to invest in the digital channels we started that about three years ago we have not done a very good job explaining to you how much we spent but its been a lot of money we spent to get out there its working because its all the greenwich awards we won as you can see in the earnings release come june were going roll out a major component of deep blue which is full remake of the individual or the retail digital stuff we are in a great shape to do that but stuff is expensive so we do monitor we think well be fine we care we prioritize nicely but robotics is something were looking into a lot of different businesses you can take some of these rote procedures we go through and make them nonpeople which should keep the people close down and they add to productivity we always look for other businesses that we can get into added a couple this year smaller ones and continue to do that diversification is still very important on both the deposit and the asset side so we will look for other deposit sources and loan products to get out there and our people we got to keep out people happy so you want to say anything dave david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp no i think thats good edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp epipens youre going to have some epipens for me david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp epipen many epipens i like poking ed michael young q analyst truist securities inc perfect and then my second question is just a followup on kind of the liquidity management asset if we look back to like as rates were rising and reaching higher levels it was more of a midteens kind of percentage of earning assets versus today and was yielding somewhere around versus today so has there anything structurally changed either within the company or within the market that would prevent it from getting back to sort of those levels if we were back into that sort of rate environment in a year or two years from now edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp it really all depends on loan growth we always ran to loan to deposits time we got overnight we were at or it may indiscernible other people happy but if you get to or for some loan to deposits that would bring us back down to a little bit lower levels in terms of the overall liquidity portfolio and as there were about three years duration on all of our liquidity including that money including the overnight wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 money we have we usually close to higher than years so thats kind of going to be the basis of deployment is love to get the loans back to to which is our target range and then invest after that that makes sense michael young q analyst truist securities inc yeah i think it does just real quick on the duration you were saying years now is that edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah look historically thats what weve been at were were a little over were now so plenty of room to grow michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay okay perfect thanks appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from russell gunther of da davidson your line is open russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co hey good afternoon guys i just have one followup on the overhead ratio discussion so the commentary of basis points moving towards to basis points that longerterm target as mortgage normalizes as we overlay the asset sensitivity discussion and that glide path to a margin i mean in that scenario do you think you can sustain around current levels or even improve upon or are the franchise investment and growth mode still likely to take us to that 130ish basis points range david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah well the basis points doesnt really get impacted by margin because the net overhead ratio is non interest income minus noninterest expense and take that result divided by average assets and so thats how we sort of break down as we look at managing the company you manage your margin you manage your provision costs and then you manage your net overhead ratio which is nonmarginrelated so the increase in rates other than potentially reducing mortgage production doesnt really have an impact on the net overhead ratio so weve been basis points and were basis points this quarter with a relatively seasonally softer mortgage volumes but that included an msr adjustment if you take that msr adjustment out youre up closer to basis points so the basis points sort of is todays sort of environment without an msr benefit and we think as we continue to grow we should be able to uphold that or improve upon it as we get operating leverage but a rise in rates doesnt necessarily directly impact the net overhead ratio edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp if you think back was our net overhead goal weve been able to get more leverage into the system as weve been able to grow and so down to basis points to basis points is not bad thats the kind of leverage we picked up by being able to handle more assets with under that expense base so i think as we wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 continue to grow i think next year we came at hypothetically i dont know what will happen but like billion not going to happen but i would expect indiscernible even more as you get more and more leverage out of it but we shall see russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co got it david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah so i think the short answer is the only thing the rates impact on the net overhead ratio generally speaking is if mortgage rates go up then the mortgage servicing rights going to gain in value and youre probably going to put pressure on your originations and so you just have to take that into account russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co no i appreciate it guys thats a pretty good explanation and thank you for that and if i then maybe ask a different way on the in that margin range do you expect to be able to demonstrate overall positive operating leverage in from a ph net interest income perspective edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yes david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah yeah edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp oh yeah russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co all right guys thank you again thats it for me edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp thank you operator thank you we have a followup question from brock vandervliet of ubs your question please wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thanks for taking the followup just on mortgage i was looking through the press release here and half the volume was refi im assuming that it should be falling pretty fast here given the moving rates are you trimming expenses in that segment preparing for heavier sailing or havent you moved in that direction yet edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp oh yeah weve been able to reduce staff in the mortgage area well they dont show because we utilize them in a different area our premium finance life business are growing so fast we needed to get some help but we got really good people we like to keep involved but we are monitoring mortgage cost we want to keep that fixed variable concept going in other words lower the fixed expense get more variable expenses and were accomplishing that i believe and well go from there but yes weve got all the time david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah and i think brock in the first quarter were probably thinking purchase purchase and refi has taken down but that even though some of the potential borrowers are in a position to do a refi just because of lower rates we are seeing some cash out refis is a big part of the refi volume now so people kind of use them the 30year product as their home equity product of old and so thats keeping that refi volume up a little bit because theres a fair amount of cash out refi is going on and people are willing to maybe even do it at a little bit higher rate because its 30year am on the loan versus a home equity line which would be a lower am and they keep their payments down so were seeing a lot of cash out refis edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah finally indiscernible youre going to see obviously home values continue to go up and people will go back to that pattern of reinstate it always and in the old days if you look at the pattern it got a mortgage got a home equity line we run up the old equity line pay up the home equity line with a new mortgage and go from there but imagine were kind of getting into that period of time thats kind of the inflationary way to do it i guess brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and i noticed the msr market is about basis points where youre carrying that msr asset just for context back in or so before rates started coming down where was that roughly just trying to gauge what kind of ceiling we could have on that on that mark david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well brock i dont have that in front of me although there was a time where those numbers were in the basis points range so i dont know if that was or not but they certainly could go up higher than this edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah basis points to basis points makes sense and we got a hell lot more than we had back then so wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc yeah okay great i appreciate all the color guys edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you operator thank you at this time id like to turn the call back over to edward wehmer for closing remarks sir edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you everybody for listening in well give you our best efforts
