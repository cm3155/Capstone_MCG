mr tim crane wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 timothy s crane president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp good morning and thank you for joining us for the fourth quarter and full year call for those we havent spoken to recently happy new year in addition to dave dykstra and rich murphy who the host introduced dave stoehr our chief financial officer and kate boege our general counsel are with me in terms of an agenda ill share some highlevel highlights dave dykstra will speak to the financial results and rich will add some additional information and color on credit performance ill wrap up with some summary thoughts on and as always well do our best to answer some questions for the year we reported record net income of just over million up over the results reflect our conservative approach to managing and growing our franchise specifically we target steady growth in both loans and deposits sound and conservative liquidity and risk management and an unwavering commitment to taking care of our clients in our materials as we do at every yearend we have also included a series of 10year historical charts that show solid progress on key metrics evidence that our approach not only works but differentiates us from many of our peers while this is not new information we think these charts are meaningful evidence of our strong and consistent performance and if you havent already i would encourage you to look at and review these materials for the fourth quarter net income was just over million a solid result given the recognition of a million extraordinary expense related to the replenishment of the fdic fund following the march bank failures and an approximately million expense related to the writedown of certain mortgagerelated assets due to the falling interest rates during the quarter we reported record net interest income of million up approximately million from the third quarter as a result of both an increase in the net interest margin of basis points to and continued good loan growth deposits were also up in the quarter noninterestbearing deposits increased slightly and were steady as a percentage of total deposits while we continue to expect credit performance to normalize from the very low levels experienced over the last few years our losses and npls remain low despite these low credit losses weve continued to build the allowance and as youll hear from rich we continue to proactively address challenged credits in our portfolio i would highlight that our allowance coverage for core loans excluding primarily our low loss insurance finance portfolio is at a healthy this detail is in table of our press release the market rate decreases during the quarter that caused the adjustment to the value of the mortgage assets also led to a material improvement in aoci driving up our book value and capital levels the tangible book value increased by million to over a share during the quarter youll see in one of the charts that i mentioned that our book value has increased every year during the 10year period shown and in fact if you were to go further back our tangible book value has increased every year since the company went public in our liquidity position remains strong overall a solid quarter which we believe will compare well and may differentiate us relative to many of our competitors with that ill turn this over to dave and rich and as i mentioned ill come back and wrap up with some thoughts on the outlook david a dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 great thanks tim first with respect to the balance sheet growth we were again pleased to see loans for the quarter grow by approximately million or on an annualized basis consistent with our prior guidance of mid to highsingledigit loan growth the increase in loans was across many of the loan categories but was primarily related to commercial real estate and commercial premium finance portfolio growth and rich murphy will talk about that in just a little bit the company also recorded deposit growth of million during the quarter which is a increase over the prior quarter on an annualized basis and as to deposit composition noninterestbearing deposits at the end of the third quarter and fourth quarter both represented of total deposits evidencing the stabilization of the non interestbearing balances during the latter half of other balance sheet results were that total assets grew by approximately million we had slightly increased ending loantodeposit ratio and our capital ratios were relatively stable with most of those ratios increasing slightly overall a very successful quarter for the growth of the franchise our differentiated business model exceptional team and service and the unique position in chicago and milwaukee markets continues to serve us very well in that regard turning to the income statement categories starting with net interest income for the fourth quarter of net interest income totaled million an increase of million as compared to the prior quarter and an increase of million as compared to the fourth quarter of i should note that the fourth quarter net interest income represents the highest quarterly amount ever recorded by the company the increase in net interest income as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to an increase in average earning assets of approximately million an increase in the companys net interest margin also contributed to the increase in net interest income the net interest margin was in the fourth quarter which was basis points higher than the prior quarter level accordingly as we discussed on prior calls our balance sheet composition structure and repricing characteristics provided for a relatively stable net interest margin during the quarter and based on the current interest rate environment we believe we can maintain our net interest margin within a narrow range around the current levels during the first quarter of and beyond in assuming the rates stay at roughly the same id also like to note that total loans as of december were million higher than the average total loans in the fourth quarter which obviously provides us with some momentum into the first quarter of the combination of the expected balance sheet growth and relatively stable net interest margin should allow for further growth of our net interest income in the first quarter of this year turning to provision for credit losses wintrust recorded a provision for credit losses of million in the fourth quarter this is up from a provision of million in the prior quarter but actually down from the million of provision recorded in the yearago quarter the higher provision expense in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter was primarily the result of higher net loan growth during the quarter a slightly higher level of net charge offs and some deterioration in the forecasted macroeconomic conditions primarily wider forecasted baa credit spreads and forecasted depreciation in the commercial real estate price index rich will talk about the credit and loan characteristics in just a bit regarding the other noninterest income and noninterest expense total noninterest income totaled million in the fourth quarter which was down approximately million when compared to the prior quarter the primary reason for the decline was related to million less of mortgage banking revenue relative to the third quarter mortgage revenue had a million unfavorable change in net valuation adjustments from our mortgage servicing rights assets and certain other mortgagerelated assets that we hold at fair value those declines were really due to a decline late in the fourth quarter in the mortgage rates and accelerated prepayment speeds wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 we also experienced million decline in production revenue due to seasonally lower volume and compressed gain on sale margins but i think its interesting to note that although our production revenue was lower than the prior quarter its actually higher than the fourth quarter of the prior year which is encouraging for us we are also encouraged that with a lower rate environment that our application volume is ticking up early in thus far albeit still at low levels we are seeing increases over application volumes that we were receiving in january of last year and application volumes that are slightly up from december of there is a variety of relatively smaller changes to the other noninterest income categories as shown in the tables in the earnings release but those changes were not unusual and in the aggregate resulted in an increase in the nonmortgagerelated categories of approximately million from the prior quarter turning to noninterest expenses noninterest expenses totaled million in the fourth quarter and were up approximately million from the prior quarter the primary reason for the increase was the negative impact of the million special assessment by the fdic to pay for the two of the bank failures that occurred earlier in the remaining variances in noninterest expense both positive and negative offset to a relatively small reduction in noninterest expenses from the prior quarter of just under million in summary it was a very good solid quarter in our view with good loan and deposit growth a stable net interest margin with the steady outlook a record level of net interest income and a continued low level of nonperforming assets we feel like weve managed well through a somewhat turbulent period in delivering net income that was a record for any full fiscal year in the companys history and we have a positive outlook for continued growth in assets revenue and earnings and although its easy to get caught up in looking at the quarterly results i think its also instructive to occasionally look back over time as tim referred to we included some 10year charts in the earnings release that i think provide some impressive evidence that our approach to running the business has provided for a consistent growth in loans deposits earnings and tangible book value per share over an extended period of time all while managing credit risk very well well work hard to continue those trends in and beyond and increase shareholder returns so with that ill conclude my comments and turn it over to rich murphy to discuss credit richard b murphy vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp thanks dave as tim and dave noted earlier credit performance continued to be very solid in the fourth quarter from a number of perspectives as detailed on slide of the deck loan growth for the quarter was million and similar to the third quarter this growth was driven by a number of factors we continue to see a harder market for insurance premiums particularly for commercial properties resulting in higher average loan sizes in our commercial premium finance portfolio and consolidation within the premium finance industry has provided us with a number of new opportunities we a saw good growth in the commercial real estate portfolio resulting largely from draws on existing construction loans and finally our leasing group had another very solid quarter total loan growth for all of was billion or we believe that loan growth for will continue to be within our guidance for the following reasons the commercial premium finance team should continue to show solid growth as premiums continue to be elevated our various pipelines have stayed very solid and our leasing team continue to see significant demand in the market and as weve noted in prior calls we continue to benefit from disruptions in the banking landscape and weve seen numerous quality opportunities in our core ci and wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 cre business in addition we continue to look at a number of lending teams and niche lending opportunities that come from dislocation in other regional banks offsetting this growth will be continued pressure on ci line utilization which dropped from to year overyear as higher borrowing costs have negatively affected usage we anticipate that higher borrowing costs will continue to cause borrowers to reconsider the economics of new projects business expansion and equipment purchases in summary we continue to be optimistic about our ability to grow loans in and we believe our diversified portfolio and position within the competitive landscape will allow us to grow within our guidance of mid to high singledigits and maintain our credit discipline from a credit quality perspective as detailed on slide we continue to see strong credit performance across the portfolio this can be seen in a number of metrics nonperforming loans increased by million during the quarter from to basis points while npls have increased from basis points to basis points during they continue to be at historically low levels and we are confident about the solid credit performance of the portfolio chargeoffs for the quarter were million or basis points up from million or basis points in  finally as detailed on slide we saw stable levels in our special mention and substandard loans with no meaningful signs of additional economic stress at the customer level as noted in our last few earnings calls we continue to be highly focused on our exposure to commercial real estate loans which comprises roughly one quarter of our total portfolio higher borrowing costs and pressure on occupancy and lease rates are cause for concern particularly in the office category as weve noted before on our second quarter call earlier this year we noted that we are very focused on a subset of office loans which are secured by coworking properties at that time we had sold a portfolio of approximately million which reduced our total coworking exposure in half during the fourth quarter we saw an increase in cre npls of million which was largely due to a downgrade of a single coworking loan to nonperforming its important to note that the underlying loan is current and has been previously identified as a potential nonaccrual due to cash flow issues we continue to work with the borrower to determine the most costeffective strategy going forward on slide we have updated a number of important characteristics of our office portfolio currently this portfolio remains steady at billion or of our total cre portfolio and only of our total loan portfolio of the billion of office exposure is medical office or owner occupied the average size of the portfolio loan in the office portfolio is only million and we continue to have only five loans above million in this category we continue to perform reviews regularly on this portfolio and we stay very engaged with our borrowers as mentioned on prior calls our cre credit team regularly updates their deep dive analysis of every loan over ph million which will be renewing between now and the end of the third quarter of this analysis which covered of all cre loans maturing during this period resulted in the following approximately onehalf of these loans will clearly qualify for a renewal at prevailing rates roughly of these loans are anticipated to be paid off or will require a shortterm extension at prevailing rates the remaining of these loans will require some additional attention which could include a paydown or a pledge of additional collateral its important to note that the previously mentioned loans secured by coworking space had been identified during our prior deep dive analysis we have backchecked the results of these tests conducted during prior quarters wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 and have found that the projected outcomes versus actual outcomes were very tightly correlated and generally speaking borrowers of loans deem to require additional attention continue to support their loans by providing enhancements including principal reductions again our portfolio is not immune from the effects of rising rates or the market forces behind lease rates but we continue to proactively identify weaknesses in the portfolio and work with our borrowers to identify the best possible outcomes we believe that our portfolio is in reasonably good shape and situated to weather the challenges ahead that concludes my comments on credit and ill turn it back to tim timothy s crane president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp great thanks rich to wrap up our prepared remarks we continue to believe that we are wellpositioned perhaps uniquely wellpositioned to take advantage of the current environment with our diverse businesses over the last several quarters weve taken steps to achieve an interest sensitivity position much closer to neutral you can see some specific data on table in our press release while we dont believe that rapid rate cuts are warranted at this point we are assuming that there will be basis point rate cuts in with that assumption as dave mentioned our net interest margin will be reasonably stable in a narrow range around the current level for the near term more interest rate cuts above and beyond the three weve assumed would slightly pressure the margin but would also likely result in more favorable economic activity as an offset for example improvements in our mortgage business and growth in commercial line utilization which rich mentioned is at currently very low levels so to reiterate our prior comments our target is to continue to grow loans in the mid to highsingledigit range in terms of our percentage and to fund the loan growth through deposit increases at like levels our pipelines remain solid and as dave mentioned we experienced strong growth at the end of the fourth quarter which represents good momentum going into the first quarter of overall were pleased with the results and were encouraged about where we start i know therell be some questions so at this point ill pause and we can turn it back to the host wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning everyone timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi maybe tim or dave just wanted to ask about some of the last comments you made tim on your expectations for the margin to remain in the current range can you talk about what you guys are doing to protect the margin around these levels i think about your loan growth guidance and the net interest income growth potential it seems a little better than peers particularly your loan growth but just talk about how youre protecting the margin and your confidence that we can maintain the current range absent greater than three cuts timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp yeah thanks jon and dave can add to this weve talked about the fact that weve got an assetsensitive loan book that continues to reprice and at this point the repricing in our loan book is closely correlated to what were seeing in terms of the increase in deposit costs we expect that for at least a short period going forward here that that will continue to be the case and that the spread between our loan and deposits will be roughly stable i would characterize stable as plus or minus some number of basis points around so we feel pretty good about that and weve baked in the three cuts starting in june if those cuts are either deeper or more than i think weve got probably some pressure on the margin but an offset in other parts of our business david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah another thing to focus i mean i think thats true the structure of the balance sheet also helps too the premium finance book which is a third of our portfolio sort of lagged on the way up but if rates go down it also lags on the way down so theres benefit to us there as you know and as weve disclosed in the materials weve got over ph billion worth of interest rate derivatives that will also assist us if rates fall down so we were patient when rates went up to allow the margin to expand and as we hit the upper we felt like we should reduce that asset sensitivity and lock in the rates through balance sheet management and derivatives and weve tried to become relatively neutral on that rate now just by using both the structure and the derivatives to be somewhat neutral here so the competitions out there so well depend on what the competition does with loan and deposit pricing if rates move but right now the way we look at the world we think we can hold it pretty tight wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay thats helpful just one more revenue question just on mortgage you touched on it but obviously a tougher revenue quarter for mortgage and i get it but i think what youre saying is originations look good spreads were depressed and if we dont have the same headwinds on the msr maybe we can repeat the kind of quarter that we saw in the first quarter of is that fair dave maybe even potentially a little better david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah i think thats pretty accurate jon i mean our production revenue was down about million to about million of production revenue but that was higher than about million of production revenue in and we had million to million of production revenue in so what were seeing is right now at least through the first part of january applications are ticking up again not wildly but they are up from december and november and clearly theyre up from where we were in january of so i would expect that that revenue would sort of get back to those levels based on what we know right now again its not going to be a spike up but i do think were going to sort of return to where weve been in the previous few quarters and then hopefully that if the spring buying season hits that mortgage rates are down a little bit and hence one of the reasons some of the msr values declined a little bit but hopefully that decline in rate spurs a little bit of additional homebuying activity come march and april jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah yeah itll be interesting to watch just a little rebound would be good though i agree on that so okay thanks a lot guys i appreciate it timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp thank you jon operator thank you please stand by for our next question our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty of kbw christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp hi chris richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp hi chris wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc maybe a question for rich i mean you guys have in the past fourth quarters i would say proactively built the reserve when things are still good given where your reserves sit today i guess can you just speak to the potential need or desire to build reserves additionally in early or is this just kind of a get ahead of it and build it while you can richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp cecl doesnt necessarily work that way i mean yeah so i mean i if you were asking me how the provisioning should work it wouldnt not necessarily result in the same things that were getting out of the cecl models because as dave pointed out i mean we the baa spreads the way they reacted definitely affected what we had to do in the fourth quarter theres just the loan growth affected it and not necessarily what rich murphy thinks about the quality of the portfolio i do think that what weve done as you point out at the end of last year this year was pretty material and i think we have put ourselves in a very good position going forward and if cecl works like its supposed to work were actually prefunding the losses that should accumulate down the road so i actually i feel really good as to where the allowance is given the shape of our portfolio right now christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp and chris i can maybe chime in a little bit i think if you look at it sort of globally without getting too far into the weeds if you look in the presentation our criticized assets that we have a special mention on substandard and good those percentages held very stable chargeoffs were still low at basis points a little higher than second quarter but still pretty low and we had a little bit more growth in the quarter but all those things werent too different quartertoquarter so as you look at that increase i think most of that is the macroeconomic factors and the biggest one that impacted us in our models and everybody uses different factors for their modeling but the baa credit spread has a high correlation to many of our loan lines that we model for and that that spread over the eight quarter period that we look at going out expanded quite a bit which had a big impact on our provisioning so if the soft landing thoughts gain traction and the consensus view amongst economists out there are that those spreads should tighten in then we should see some benefit going forward but in the fourth quarter it was worse than the third quarter and it really generated the extra reserves indiscernible christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 okay thats great color thanks just i know some banks have disclosed which are the moodys scenarios and the s4 s2 what they weigh have you can you remind us if youve communicated like what scenarios is currently factored or the weight into the scenarios david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah i mean well we look at all the moodys factors we also look at some blue chip other sort of consensus forecasts that are out there but we are using the baseline scenario of moodys but various factors out of that baseline scenario christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay maybe just one more and ill hop back the capital outlook mid to highsingledigit balance sheet growth your roe can certainly support more growth how do we think about perhaps other uses of capital in any thawing in ma conversations is that something you would consider any color on capital use would be great thanks timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp yeah well the straightforward part is that as you said the earnings of the company should support the loan growth thats been the case for several quarters now but isnt a longterm trend for wintrust where typically weve needed to add capital to the extent one we continue to build capital thats good and on the ma front i would say that the conversations are still active but theres also not a lot of activity and i dont know that others who might be in a position that its better to talk about that would think that theres going to be a shortterm change there clearly the rates coming down and help the aoci situation for a number of people who had impaired either loan books or securities portfolio but weve been acquisitive in the past i think we may be in the future but were disciplined about it christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of casey haire of jefferies casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning everyone timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp good morning casey haire q analyst jefferies llc wanted to touch a little bit on the nim stability guide just along those three cuts what kind of deposit beta you guys are assuming throughout the year if we get those kind of cuts wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah well i think generally were believing that at this point that if the fed cuts for the noncd term cds that are fixed that we should be able to reduce the rates fairly quickly by basis points so were expecting as we increased rates rapidly as rates went up were expecting to be able to follow fairly closely with cuts in our money markets and savings and the like timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp casey the other thing were seeing we dont have a huge book of municipal deposits but some of those have reference rates if you will and were starting to see as a result of whats happening with rates those index or reference rates come down and so weve seen some minor benefit on a portion of the book already casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great and just a question on the fixed rate asset repricing benefit in the release you guys called out about ph billion that matures within or reprices within the next year just wondering do you have the what the yield is on that and what it could reprice to david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah no we havent disclosed that casey i dont have it handy here right now but well think about putting that in future releases casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great and just lastly the loantodeposit ratio ticked up a little bit to i think you guys have talked about to i know youre talking about funding loan growth with deposits but just wondering if there is a hard cap on that loantodeposit ratio david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp no we think we like it sort of in this range is fine with us it ticked up a little bit i would expect it to come down again next quarter a lot of our loan growth just happened near the end of the quarter and so we were just trying to match deposit loan growth and there was a lot that flowed in towards the latter part of december so just a little probably mismatch on the timing of the deposit raising but probably expect that to drift back down to ph again next quarter or so casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of jeff rulis of da davidson wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co hi thanks good morning rich i wanted to circle back on the cowork you singled out the one credit of i think million what is the total remaining cowork exposure richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp negligible i think there might be certainly under million i think pretty well below that there might a couple of small pieces but generally that were largely with this issue being largely addressed i think that largely is behind us jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay so that was the bulk of it i guess and then just sort of tracking some of those tables towards the back was that credit identified and sliding from kind of past due richard b murphy a vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp no the loan was current indiscernible jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co yeah yeah got it okay and maybe just hopping to expenses safe to assume that quarterly fdic insurance reverts back in the mid million range in other words absent the special assessment that could be a good run rate for and then kind of the followon question to that is just overall expense run rate expectations there would be helpful thanks david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah well clearly special assessment is a onetime item i think towards the end of the couple of years out depending on how those things settle out they may true it up a little bit for now yes that number goes away and youd be in that mid9 million range but that assessment grows as the company grows so as much as we dont like to pay the assessment probably that expense number goes up because were going to grow the franchise over the course of the year but you can see that its trended up over time so we would only expect it to go up with the growth of the balance sheet though and then overall expenses its sort of similar to what weve talked about in the past if you sort of look at the non fdicimpacted run rates of the third and the fourth quarter those will probably increase slightly in as we have merit raises for the employees and the impact of inflation the impact of the fdic insurance coverage increasing as we grow and we continue to invest in our infrastructure digital and technologywise but so probably that midsingle digit range is what we would expect using the third and the fourth quarters as a base and if we can grow loans on the franchise in the mid to highsingledigit range we can get that operating leverage out of the system wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co sounds good thank you and then the last one just and you kind of touched on a little bit but in that mid to highsingledigit loan growth outlook for do you have anything kind of layered in there is it sort of a soft landing type assumption or thats a crystal balltype question but for the bulk of do you have a recessionary or slowdown macrowise embedded timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp well my answer to that would be weve fortunately got a diversified and pretty granular loan book so as weve talked about in the past the transportation business and some of our customers are already experiencing challenging conditions and others are doing terrific so i dont know that a technical recession is much going to change the environment and we think across our loan book well get a pretty balanced level of growth over the year david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah its a great point tim because we have all these different engines that just fire at different times if you kind of look at where the growth is coming from over this last year our life premium finance group essentially had zero or actually negative growth largely because in a higher rate environment it doesnt work if you got into a recessionarytype situation and they bring rates down that product suddenly looks much more attractive and a lot of the loan growth that we had two years ago was out of that product so as different as the right rate cycles move through they definitely affect different things right now as we talked about line utilization in a higher rate environment really gets impacted if rates come down youre going to see the opposite effect so i think theres going to be some cyclicality but its just going to affect different products at different times so we stay pretty committed to that mid to highsingledigit growth forecast jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay i appreciate it operator thank you please stand by for our next question our next question comes from the line of brandon king of truist brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp good morning brandon king q analyst truist securities inc wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 so i had a question on deposits i noticed most of the growth in the quarter came from money market and savings accounts and im wondering if or is that the expectation going forward where well see most of the deposit growth timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp well we think the mix has somewhat stabilized but with these higher rates than we had a year or months ago clearly the interestbearing products are more attractive to our clients and so i think youre going to see money market and cd growth that you wouldnt have seen a couple of years ago and were working hard and hopeful that the noninterest bearing portion continues to stay reasonably stable around brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and is part of that strategy also sort of anticipating a fed easing cycle as maybe those money market accounts maybe easier to lower those rates i guess faster than if we do more of the cd funding timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp well i think what you said is correct that the money market accounts would probably move more quickly than some of the other interestbearing products but we offer a wide set of options to our customers and they select what they believe to be the best fit for them so we are seeing more cdrelated activity as you can get rates in the range whether thatll continue as rates come down you may get people trying to kind of lockin those levels brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and then another question i know i appreciate the commentary on the reserve increase but i did notice the reserve increase was primarily in the ci category so i just wonder if you could speak to just the health of your ci customers and credit trends there as opposed to a lot of attention is on the cre ph space timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp yeah i think a couple of things that i would point to one is as we noted earlier that the level of classified assets remains pretty consistent so we try to be very proactive on our risk ratings and if you start to see special mention classified assets start to move up i think that would be a pretty direct reflection but more anecdotally we spend a lot of time talking to our customers about where their business is at and i would say generally speaking people still feel like that top line revenue number is holding together pretty well and that solves a lot of problems obviously higher borrowing costs can affect them clearly the economy i think has slowed a little bit and so thats affected them but while it may not be as rosy when you had zero interest rates and the economy was just really clicking along it doesnt feel that bad for most of our ci customers i think that they still feel pretty optimistic about where their overall revenues are coming from and where those levels will be i think labor has probably become less of a concern for them and just overall input costs are have stabilized so i would say just netnet i think they feel still pretty good wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 brandon king q analyst truist securities inc great thats for taking my questions operator thank you please stand by for our next question which comes from the line of ben gerlinger of citi benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hey good morning guys timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp hey ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc so im going to ask a question i know youre probably going to be a little annoyed but im going to ask it anyway so when you think about what im getting is kind of midsingle digit maybe uppermiddlesingledigit loan growth deposit growth its kind of flat margin at the like what would you said if three cuts kind of a range if the market has a little bit more probably see a little bit pressure on that thats largely just because of back book repricing on some cre and then premium finance still has a little tail left in it but as we get towards the end of the year and possibly into if there is a four cut amount rate cut environment do you think is there any incremental pressure because i mean like you said the premium finance probably rolls over and starts to work against you but you also have indexed deposit costs im just trying to think its a moving target obviously but just any incremental thoughts on how you might exit the year and into and i get you havent given guidance at all so just kind of finger in the air that would be really helpful timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp well couple of things to be clear we have very few actual index deposit products so while the municipal rates for example that i mentioned earlier are tied to some reference rates theyre not contractual so other than our cd book were largely pricing at our discretion as we talked about if you get more rate cuts or faster rate cuts or you get they slightly would pressure our margin beyond the assumed three cuts but our mortgage business would likely perform better and to richs point were at very low levels in terms of utilization on lines right now and we would expect to see some rebound there as rates come down so while there might be some pressure on the margin as rates continue to drop we have other aspects of our business that we think will perform well so thats kind of the best way were looking at that and why we value the diversified businesses as an important part of our model benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc yeah no thats great color its a great point too that the fee income aspect will definitely kind of pick up some of the slack or if not all the slack goes to the softer spread revenue can you just remind us any sort of kind of efficiency ratio on mortgage i guess that we havent seen a robust mortgage market im just trying to think like wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 if that does start to turn back on expenses are also obviously going to go up as well im just trying to match the two if we do see a rebound in mortgage david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah it sort of depends on how hot the market gets and how wide gross margin the gainonsale margins are but i generally think of the efficiency ratio and the mortgage business will be in about an efficiency ratio business so benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you thats really helpful appreciate the color it looks like you guys have kind of a pure growth ph horsepower year its good that the margin should stay roughly flat so im looking forward to it thanks guys timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp yes thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy of stephens inc terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning dave and im pretty sure its in the appendix but what are the hedges costing you each quarter like million comes to mind but do you have that number handy and what is that what would that be if we get threerate cuts and when does that turn from a headwind to a tailwind david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah well so i think it was about basis points of impact to the margin and its about million a month so million a quarter right now if sofr moved one way or the other that would change that but we put a slide in our presentation deck that gives all the details of what the particular strike rates are but were receiving fixed and paying variables so if sofr goes down at all even though we may not hit the strike rate well get benefit because well pay less so that million a quarter if sofr comes down will decline by what we pay by basis points so its effectively locking in ph billion worth of our variable rate portfolio into more of a fixed rate scenario that are sofr based terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks for that and then are you or how are you using loan modifications within commercial real estate and how are you defining a market rate if you are using modifications david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah i mean modifications are part of the business but we dont if a loan is seriously affected by lease rates or vacancy or rising rates and you cant just hide a problem with a loan modification so similar to the one that we wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 just identified that loan is current but at some point you have to look at that and say is there really going to be the opportunity to change the income stream or change the cash flow with a modification generally speaking you really have to be honest and the borrower and the bank have to be honest about whether thats going to solve the problem in a case like that its so challenged that its not so we do use modifications but its really got to be a situation where the difference between the targeted policydriven cash flow coverage and the actual cash flow coverage are relatively close and youre just working with them to maybe extend the amortization a little bit or something like that to give them a little bit of relief to bridge the gap but generally speaking i mean we dont use modifications all that often and when we do were pretty much the interest rate is pretty much at market rate terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks for the color there and thanks for taking my questions timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp thanks terry operator thank you please stand by for our next question our next question comes from the line of brody preston of ubs timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp good morning brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone i just wanted to get a little bit more granular dave on the loan yields i understand the margin commentary that you gave but wanted to kind of ask you just given the premium finance books how you expect the loan yields to trend in the middle part of the year just given the moves in the oneyear cmt that have already occurred david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah well the book thats tied to the oneyear cmt is the life insurance premium finance book and so as youre alluding to the rate now is very similar to the rate a year ago so the benefit from that book is pretty baked in right now so the repricing on those should stay relatively the same the commercial premium finance book however is still is repricing over time and although those are not indexed to the prime rate they have pretty good correlation to the prime rate because we generally are adjusting our rates when the fed is adjusting and therefore most people are adjusting prime and if you go back a year prime was at the end of and at the end of this year so theres another basis points of repricing on that portion of the book and then we have the fixed rate commercial real estate loan book that we have out there some of that will reprice too wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and the stuff thats fixed rate thats not like premium financerelated at all how much of that do you expect to reprice on a quarterly basis over the next year david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well weve got billion in total but if you look at that the big portion of that is our premium finance portfolio at million so we had another billion of commercial and commercial real estate type of loans that will reprice over the course of the year and i would probably just say its ratable i dont think we have any seasonality per se to that portfolio brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp and that these levels is generally slightly helpful as they reprice david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc yeah understood is it fair to assume when i look at that kind of one to fiveyear bucket as well that its a similarly ratable repricing there im just trying to make sure i get the cadence correct through david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah we sort of looked at this we dont have any maturity walls coming from that you can say oh my gosh when we get out months were going to have just boatload repricing or we dont get any repricing for three or four years its fairly ratable brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it on the nibs you guys kind of bucked the trend versus the group this quarter a lot of other banks have actually seen a reacceleration in nib outflow wanted to ask you specifically if there was anything that drove the strength in the fourth quarter on a periodend basis like if theres any chunky kind of deposits that came from institutionaltype money timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 no not significantly i mean we have large flows at the end of the year as people position their balance sheets but weve worked really hard on the deposit side of the equation to continue to grow clients and we are hopeful that the turns into a stable level for us and our team continues to add commercial clients that have non interestbearing deposits and treasury services and use other products and services we offer so its sort of a function of building the franchise david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah thats the way i would look at it too i mean rich talked about theres little less line usage so some of those people that maybe would have drawn on the line have used some of their noninterestbearing deposits and maybe thats a reason why youre seeing some of that industrywide but as tim said if we continue to grow the franchise and add customers that right now was offsetting any of that additional leakage and were being able to hold it pretty well and its been pretty stable on an average basis for the last couple of quarters so were hopeful that we can hold it in there brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc great and then just last one for me is just on the wealth businesses are pretty decent pickup in the assets under administration this quarter after they were flat last quarter i just wanted to ask what caused that to occur david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp for the revenue to be flattish youre saying timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp just the growth i think brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc no the aua was up from billion to billion david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah a couple of things with that some of the brokerage accounts grew a little bit we also our maxsafe product that we have the way we operate that is that works through our trust company as a fiduciary account so those get included shows a little bit of growth in that area and just a little bit spread out in other places so nothing significant per se in any one chunky sort of deal brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 18jan2024 yeah and we also in that number as we note in the press release our investment portfolio was is also managed out of our wealth management area and included in those assets under management now those ticked up a little bit brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay so that the move higher shouldnt necessarily result in a similar move higher in revenue for next quarter david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp some of it is based on beginning of quarter asset valuations versus daily or end of quarter so you might see a little bit of pickup there brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc all right great well thank you very much for taking my questions everyone i appreciate it timothy s crane a president chief executive officer wintrust financial corp you bet david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp thanks operator thank you i would now like to turn the
