the call over to mr edward wehmer edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you very much welcome everybody to our fourth quarter and yeartodate earnings call with me always are dave dykstra our chief operating officer dave stoehr our what are you dave our david l stoehr chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp cfo edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp cfo tim crane the president rich murphy our head credit guru and kate boege our general counsel weve the same format as weve been doing in the past im going to give some general comments regarding our results about the quarter and the year in total turn over to tim crane for more detail on the balance sheet and then to dave dykstra who is going to discuss the income statement in detail rich murphy is just going to talk about credit and back to me for some summary comments about the future well have some time for questions we finished the year very well its a great year for us beach ball jumped up its on its way up earnings for the year of million almost million up almost from the previous year diluted earnings per share of for the quarter million million compared to million million in the third quarter and about million in the fourth quarter wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 earnings per share for the quarter for the year compared to for the previous year and the pre tax preprovision income it was a record for us i think million versus the million for the year or million versus million and the indiscernible continue its way up and the margin finished at for the year up from in the third quarter up basis points and basis points yeartodate at and then we expect to approach coming this next quarter tim will talk about all that return on assets around of the year for the quarter return on equity of for the year tangible book value rose to a share compared to fourth quarter again it was a very good year for us if you look at the balance sheet to some extent assets grew nicely for the year the loans were up about billion versus about almost million over average so well be able to post that going forward the margin as tim will discuss tim and dave will discuss i mean to hedge a little bit to maintain our downside risk it makes sense as rates go up their next move will be down at some point and theyre adjusting the balance sheet there tim will talk about that credit cycle is so remarkably good murphy will talk about that but well point out that if you look at the real numbers the quarter was actually down for the quarter because of about million of fiscal life loans that got hung up and waiting for the money to come back if we look at the fiscal portfolio you have to understand that all that money thats out there that we show is past due has been confirmed is going to be returned so our credit was actually better than it was before and feel very good about that ill now turn over to tim timothy s crane president wintrust financial corp all right edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp to talk about the balance sheet timothy s crane president wintrust financial corp looks good thanks ed id like to highlight a few balance sheet items and ill also comment on several items likely to be of interest including the continued impact of rising rates and the margin expectations the approximately billion of growth for the fourth quarter was11 loan growth on an annualized basis which continues to be spread nicely across all major loan categories as noted in the release periodend loan balances were million higher than the quarter average which will help our first quarter results going forward while we remain encouraged by stable loan pipelines we believe there is some evidence of a modest slowdown in market loan demand loan growth in the mid to highsingle digits on an annualized basis remains a reasonable expectation given the current economic uncertainty rich will speak to loans in more detail in just a few minutes but a couple of notes on the provision and on our allowance of the million in provision approximately twothirds is related to a modest deterioration in the cecl macroeconomic factors and only one third is related to our growth in portfolio changes that occurred during the quarter to be clear we are not signaling a change in our credit performance wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 with respect to our allowance of basis points of total loans its important to note that excluding our historically low loss niche loans primarily the premium finance loans our allowance is basis points of total core loans you can see that on table of the press release where we provide some detail deposit growth for the quarter was approximately million the continued rise in rates is clearly making deposit gathering more challenging the cost of deposits is rising and nominal changes in deposit mix are occurring interestbearing deposit costs of basis points for the fourth quarter were up basis points we anticipate continued increases in both the fed funds rate and the rates associated with the banks loan and deposit activity increases in loan yields however at this point in the cycle continue to exceed the change in deposit costs given our asset sensitive position our deposit betas and the increase in deposit costs todate are in line with our expectations currently the beta on our interestbearing deposits is approximately we anticipate an interestbearing deposit beta of approximately to over the full cycle of interest rate changes our securities book was up billion in the quarter as we believe yields are becoming more attractive and represent the opportunity for reasonable longerterm returns at yearend liquidity remained strong with approximately billion of cash on the balance sheet as discussed last quarter our securities book is split almost equally between availableforsale and heldtomaturity while the afs valuation swings during the year were significant as ed pointed out the banks tangible book value was up for both the fourth quarter and the year to a share those of you who follow us know that the tangible book value per share is an important metric for us it has increased every year since going public in with respect to rate sensitivity in the margin although our gaap position is trending down we remain asset sensitive and wellpositioned to continue to benefit from rising interest rates we believe each basis point increase in the fed funds rate at this point in the cycle will result in approximately million in pretax net interest income on an annualized basis and an improvement in the margin of to basis points note this is down slightly from our prior positioning to be more specific on the margin as ed mentioned that was in the fourth quarter an improvement of basis points with rates rising we continue to achieve and in some cases exceed the margin improvement discussed or projected on our prior calls at this point depending on the impact of competition for deposits and the pace of additional fed increases we believe our margin will approach at some point during the first quarter and has not yet peaked conversely while we clearly benefit from rising rates as discussed on our last call the bank entered into several interest rate collars in the third quarter of further early in this quarter first quarter of the bank entered into additional derivatives contracts with the intent of reducing the variability of the margin in a lower interest rate environment our approach has been to leg into these contracts and we anticipate that additional activity on this front is likely you can see table in the press release for more information on our gaap position as you know we also view our mortgage business as a natural hedge as it is proven to perform well in lower rate environments when margins tend to be pressured for the fourth quarter capital ratios were stable to up slightly and remain appropriate given our risk profile and with the higher net interest margin and currently forecasted loan growth the companys earnings are projected to result in organic improvement to our capital levels in the coming quarters with that ill turn it over to dave wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 david alan dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp great thanks tim as usual ill cover some of the noteworthy income statement categories starting with net interest income tim and ed have referenced some of these numbers but well just go through it in detail for the fourth quarter of net interest income totaled million that was an increase of million as compared to the third quarter of and an increase of million as compared to the fourth quarter of last year the million increase in net interest income as compared to the prior quarter was due to an increase in the net interest margin and loan growth as a basis point improvement in the margin brought it to in the fourth quarter a beneficial increase of basis points on the yield on earning assets and a basis point increase in the net free funds contribution combined with the negative impact of a basis point increase on the rate paid on liabilities resulted in that improved net interest margin the increase in the yield on earning assets in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to an basis point improvement on loan yields and higher liquidity management asset yields as the company earned higher shortterm yields on its interestbearing deposits held at banks and its investment securities portfolio the increase in the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior quarter was driven by a basis point increase in the rates paid on the interestbearing deposits tim already went through the deposit beta so i will let you refer to his comments on that turning to the provision for credit losses wintrust recorded a provision for credit losses of million in the fourth quarter compared to a provision of million in the prior quarter and a million provision expense recorded in the yearago quarter the higher provision expense in the fourth quarter was primarily a result of less favorable macroeconomic environment conditions including wider projected credit spreads and less favorable commercial real estate price index data included in the economic forecast that we use stronger loan growth also contributed to provision expense for the quarter rich will talk about credit in more detail but i should note that the current quarters net chargeoffs the mix of classified loans and the delinquency data all remained relatively stable or better and really pretty good so those factors really did not have a significant impact on the level of the fourth quarters provision for credit losses expense and as tim said this is not the larger expense level its not a signaling of any specific issues its really a function of the macroeconomic forecast that we used in our cecl models turning to other noninterest income and noninterest expense in the noninterest income section our wealth management revenue was down million from the prior quarter and was at the level of million for the quarter decline in revenues for this quarter were primarily related to less fees associated with our taxdeferred likekind exchange business which had been very strong in the prior quarters and slowed just a bit in the fourth quarter consistent with overall industry trends and the impact of relatively higher home mortgage rates our mortgage banking operation experienced a revenue decline of million from the third quarter due to lower loan origination volumes and lower production margins during the quarter we expect mortgage origination volumes to continue to be low in the first quarter due to the rate environment and the seasonal purchasing trends but its still an important part of our business and we expect it to pick up some volume when the spring buying season starts in the second quarter wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 the company recorded net losses on investment securities of approximately million during the fourth quarter compared to a million net loss in the prior quarter as market conditions and equity valuations continued to affect a portion of our securities portfolio other noninterest income totaled million in the fourth quarter which was up million from the amount recorded in the prior quarter a contributing reason for the increase in this category is that the company recorded approximately million of higher boli income which was primarily related to higher earnings on boli investments that support certain deferred compensation plan benefits and so i should note that net that million increase in the boli income has a similar offsetting increase in compensation expense during the quarter so they sort of net as part of net income goes but there is an increase in both of those categories for the quarter additionally prior quarter had a negative valuation adjustment of approximately million on our early buyout loans certain early buyout loans whereas the prior quarter the prior quarter had a million negative valuation on the early buyout loans whereas the current quarter had an insignificant adjustment turning to noninterest expenses noninterest expenses totaled million in the fourth quarter and were up a little over million when compared to the prior quarter total of million the primary reason for the increase was due to higher compensationrelated expenses and a variety of other less significant contributing factors salaries and employee benefits expense increased by approximately million in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior quarter of the year relative to the prior quarter the increase of million of higher salaries expenses and million of higher employee benefits expense were the primary causes as to the higher salaries expenses which was caused by million of increased deferred compensation costs as i mentioned partially related to the underlying boli investments where we recorded the income on the other noninterest income part of the income statement and on the employee benefit side those are almost exclusively related to higher health insurance claims during the quarter so elevated in the fourth quarter generally as people try to use up some of their health benefits before the deductibles reset also although a smaller change from the quarter commissions and incentive compensation was slightly lower as mortgage banking commissions were reduced although we did have some higher bonus and longterm incentive compensation accruals for the quarter related to the higher earnings level but the net was a reduction in that category advertising and marketing expenses decreased by million in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter as weve discussed on previous calls this category of expenses tends to be lower in the fourth and first quarters of the year due to less marketing and sponsorship expenditures related to various major and minor league baseball sponsorships and less summertime sponsorship events that we obviously dont do in the wintertime professional fees increased by approximately million in the fourth quarter these fluctuations were primarily related to some consulting services that we utilized in conjunction with the implementation of various financial and customer related processing systems other miscellaneous expense increased by million during the quarter which included a million additional charitable contributions and a variety of other normal operational fluctuations none of which i think are worth noting for this call our efficiency ratio declined to for the fourth quarter from in the third quarter as our expenses did not increase at a rate commensurate with the increase in revenue wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 and with that i will turn it over to rich to cover credit richard b murphy vice chairman chief lending officer wintrust financial corp thanks dave as noted earlier our credit performance for the fourth quarter was very solid from a number of perspectives as detailed on slide of the deck loan growth for the quarter was billion or annualized an outstanding result and similar to the past few quarters we continue to see loan growth across the portfolio specifically commercial real estate grew by million commercial loans bolstered by a strong quarter end leasing grew by million commercial premium finance had another solid quarter up million and residential real estate loans were up million yearoveryear we saw a total loan growth of billion or net of ppp loans a very productive as noted on our prior earnings calls we continue to see very solid momentum in our core ci and cre portfolios pipelines have been very strong throughout the year and we saw that materialize into increased outstandings over the past several quarters in addition ongoing disruptions within the competitive banking landscape continue to work to our benefit also commercial premium finance had a very strong with increased outstandings of close to billion yearoveryear we anticipate this momentum will continue into while we are optimistic about loan growth for this year we would anticipate that the pace of growth may trend closer to the middle of our guidance of mid to highsingle digits for a number of reasons while wintrust life finance grew by billion during the rapid increases in rates during the past year have affected that pace of growth this portfolio grew million in the fourth quarter versus million in the third quarter we would anticipate the slower rate of growth will continue in this higher rate environment also increases in commercial line utilization excluding leases and mortgage warehouse lines as detailed on slide have flattened during the fourth quarter possibly reflecting a more cautious business sentiment as a result while we continue to be diligent about the possibility of a business recession we believe our diversified portfolio and position within the competitive landscape will allow us to grow within our guidance of mid to highsingle digits and maintain our credit discipline from a credit quality perspective as detailed on slide we continue to see strong credit performance across the portfolio this can be seen in a number of ways nonperforming loans remain stable at basis points or million compared to million in the third quarter and as ed noted earlier of this total million was related to wintrust life loans which went days past maturity roughly half these loans have since been paid off the balance of which are fully secured and we would anticipate full repayment from the carrier shortly overall npls continue to be at very low levels and we are still confident about the solid metrics in the portfolio chargeoffs through the quarter were million or basis points up slightly from the previous quarter charge offs for totaled million or basis points finally as detailed in slide we saw stable levels in our special mention and substandard loans with no meaningful signs of additional economic stress at the customer level that concludes my comments on credit and ill turn it to ed to wrap up edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 thanks murph well yearend is always a good time to review not just the fourth quarter and the yeartodate but further review the entire body of work over a longer period of time versus our stated goals that the company has had lets go back years now if you just go back years results versus peers itd be about the same increasing tangible book value we think is extremely important one of the goals we always looked at as tim noted earlier weve increased it every year since we went public eightyear cagr of is pretty good given last year had been kind of tough but we still were up above we were positive earnings growth at 10year cagr asset growth dividends paid stock price only go figure so in years under review we saw a bit of everything high rates low rates pandemics you name it wintrust has thrived during all of these its a testament to our business model we employ and the people who work at wintrust when rates were low our mortgage company helped pick up the slack and net interest margin compression of the net interest margin compression that occurred the lower rates indiscernible the more we increased our positive gap rates have risen mortgages has died down i say this because im often asked well youre a mortgage bank no were not its just part of what we do this is an orchestra here not a combo this is a big orchestra theyre all sorts of different parts at times they all kick in at times they dont kick in mortgage is still an extremely important thing important offering that we have but its not doing well now but it will do well as rates come back down now with the margin up were embarking on as tim mentioned locking in this increased margin for a longer period of time all of the above has been accomplished when we attained our exceptional credit statistics indiscernible concentration skill has also served us well both in deposit and the asset side extremely well diversified and its something that always works when something isnt working were a growth company that takes what the market gives us acquisitions or organic growth or have both worked very well for us based on the above and many more points one has to wonder why we consistently traded at a discount to our peers i have to put that in there im sorry indiscernible more of the same our margins should continue to increase as the remainder of asset portfolio reprices and liability costs increase at a lesser rate indiscernible in our future indiscernible locking in higher margin as we mentioned in todays comment it is already underway loan pipelines are still strong but been lower historically as murph pointed out and we keep our guidance the same but are focusing on the lower side of that credit stats were stellar but were prepared for additional indiscernible moodys which we had one this quarter and this is still being evaluated in all aspects of our business pricing is still an issue especially given stock price now indiscernible american business is on track for first or second quarter closing in short we like where we stand with all that i think you can ensure our best efforts going forward and well be consistently good with all the major owners of this or that wish to tie up in this company im not going to do anything stupid in fact we hope to thrive no matter what the economic cycle is and where were at in it to share our best efforts in this and time for some questions please wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions thank you our first question comes from the line of jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets your question please jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes can you hear me all right edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah how are you jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah good jon arfstrom from rbc you guys the numbers look good here the one that surprised me a little bit was the provision and it seems like youve touched on it and alluded to it but what do you want the message for us to be going forward feels like its going to pull back it feels like it pulls back with a little bit slower loan growth as well but do you guys view this as more of a onetime step up and we go back to a normal pace or how should we think about that david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp well i think jon the cecl as you know is sort of a life of long concept and if we have loan growth the provision will go up but if the economic scenario stayed exactly the same youd have no additional provision in the next quarter per se for that so it really depends if the and the economists obviously change their forecast frequently but if that forecast gets better next quarter you could expect the provision to come down if it gets worse it would probably stay elevated so its really a function of where the economy is going but as tim and rich and ed and i have all said theres nothing specific here that were pointing to that we think is a current problem in the portfolio this is just how commercial real estate price index forecast and how baa credit spreads and gdp and all those forecasts got moderately worse in the forecasts that we economic forecast we use so it really is a function of the cecl modeling and not a function of us seeing deterioration in our credit so if you can tell me where that crystal ball is next quarter as far as economic forecast you could know which way our provisions probably going to go jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay so it really wasnt any heavier weighting by you it was just more of the output from what edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp yes edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp indiscernible jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay sure thatll be in the transcript ed the other question i have is on the margin i think i understand what you guys are saying but if the fed it feels like youre trying to protect downside but if the fed bumps a couple more times and then holds it for a while what could happen to your margin are you you guys are talking about a level but then ed you kind of alluded to floating a little bit higher above what do you think about the margin outlook in that kind of a scenario where the fed is not cutting edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well theyre raising well it should be as tim said million on annual basis per quarter eventually the there have been a lagging on the indiscernible able to lag on the deposits purchase is going to catch up to that overall beta we still have a lot of assets that are repricing right now so if you think about premium finance businesses every prices over the course of a year so other assets will do the same were monitoring this very carefully as we lay into these derivatives to help maintain the margin so its hard to say where its going to be as indiscernible some of the derivatives we give up we give up some upside related to the downside but i think that no matter how its go margin will continue to go up if we can predict something in the to range long term depending on where rates are at thatd be a good thing but it will take a lot more derivatives to do that and were not really good at market timing so well when that happens the mortgages will kick in and life would be good again in that regard so it kind of has some internal hedges too but tim do you want to talk about that timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah i think jon in general we would expect the margin to sort of top out after the fed stops raising rates and so whether thats a quarter or two or whether we moderate that with some thoughtful decisions around the derivatives thats kind of what were thinking david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp but yeah jon i think what weve said here is that we expect the margin to approach and as fed raises some more it may pop a little over but then we think given existing competitive pressures and the existing yield curve that if they stop raising that we can kind of hold it there if all else being stable because as ed said we have a lot of asset beta left too everyone talks about the deposit betas but if you look at our life insurance premium finance portfolio as you know that those reset once a year and if you go back a year theyre based generally off of a 12month libor or 12month treasury rate and those rates were basis points a year ago if you look at the page of our earnings release those rates are up over basis points so theres a lot of repricing that wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 happens there the property and casualty premium finance loans our fixed rate loans and so they reprice over the course of a year so thats a third of our portfolio that has pretty good deposits or asset beta changes left that we think will substantially offset the deposit beta so we feel like we can kind of hold the margin if they go higher and then plateau jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thats all very helpful guys i appreciate it thank you edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of david long of raymond james your question please david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp how are you doing david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good good you guys are bucking the trend here on the deposit side showing deposit growth a lot of the banks continue to have outflows what are your expectations on the deposit flows and then also mix shift hasnt changed too much as you alluded to do you see much mix shift incoming in the next couple of quarters timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah david its tim the deposit activity has been lumpy both in and out i would add weve been pretty disciplined with our pricing and cautious about getting ahead of the market were responding to promotional activity to retain our clients and frankly weve got some higher deposit cost built into our projections we think we operate in good markets with a lot of deposit potential weve typically outperformed our peers in terms of growth even though were one or two in deposit share in many of our markets we still only have overall growth in chicago and milwaukee so our multicharter brand and approach we think will help us and we think were holding our own id add sort of an interesting fact here during the last quarter or two quarters rather weve helped clients purchase almost billion worth of shortterm treasuries that previously had been held as deposits at the bank and as the gap between deposit pricing and treasuries starts to narrow again we expect well get an opportunity at some of that money but we dont i mean well protect the mix as best we can clearly people are moving out of dda in some cases for the rates in money markets or savings or cd products so i think thats possible wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 thatll continue but i can tell you were intensely focused on adding deposits and relationships and we still think weve got terrific market opportunities so were going to hold our own and stay at it david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good thanks tim and then my followup here relates to the amount of cash you have versus deposits a lot of your peers dont have much cash and theyve really had to increase fhlb borrowings and use of highercost cds your cash as i see it is down to just under of deposits youre up over at september do you monitor that is that something that you have a target you want to keep above a certain cash level just in case you do get some deposit runoff and you dont have to chase yields david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp yeah i think were sort of comfortable where the cash is now i remember last quarter at the end of the third quarter we had billion extra sitting in cash because we had done some borrowings at the federal home loan bank that we had indicated we would invest at the beginning of the quarter and we did that so i think if you look at it we were in the high and then we went to the high if you adjust for that billion that we invested shortly after the end of the third quarter and now were around billion we like that position we sort of focus on loantodeposit ratio of to were slightly over that but still in a range were comfortable with and then we were lagging on investing that securities portfolio in the past we just been investing in the range was not that prudent and so we were patient and then we have invested now that rates are higher and we think that part of the remixing of the balance sheet to protect against down rates is to invest in some of the longerterm security portion of the balance sheet so we think i think we like where were at right now as far as the mix of cash securities and loans and as we grow that mix will probably stay about the same edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah liquidity has always been very important to us and we expect our deposit costs to go up but we have a lot of room there where given the beta we talked about were not there yet at the same time the assets should move and the real trick is going to be protecting the margin when this peeks out and you know black swan hits and its going to drop like a rock no matter what the environment is and you have to be prepared for that too so we are were vigilant were constantly looking at it and liquidity is extremely important to us dont forget were kind of a bank because of liquidity not because of credit it was the largest bank probably at the time and the liquidity is still important to us we monitor it very very carefully david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc thats great thanks for the color guys appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty of kbw your line is open chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 hey good morning thanks edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc how are you doing dave the margin roughly that youre talking about i guess what does that map to in terms of loan yields right youve got the premium finance book that keeps this kind of got a backward lag but is it somewhere in the mid6 it feels like its kind of somewhere in the mid is kind of where your loan yields are going to go david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp you know probably at mid approaching right now i would say but if rates keep going up and the mix of the business changes i mean thats a variable but thats we dont give guidance give specific guidance but thats the right zip code christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then there was a comment in the press release that just talked about additional improvements in efficiency maybe you could throw a little more color around that youre obviously in a good spot in exiting the year in the mid but how would you think about that ratio playing out appreciating that mortgages in recessionary levels thanks david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp yeah so mortgage lower mortgages obviously help the efficiency ratio but the expense side of the equation that will have some additional expenses in the fdic rates are up compensation cost will go up a little bit as we push through salary raises and the like later this quarter but i think with the inflation and the fdic and all sorts of things generally youre probably slightly above midsingledigit growth in expenses and if you add on the acquisition were planning its probably highsingledigit expense growth for the entire year first quarter it probably doesnt grow too much on the expense side we dont think but then as we add in the acquisition when that closes that will add to it and then salaries will kick in indiscernible margin the margin is going to increase substantially and we think that the mid50 efficiency ratio we have probably drifts down closer to and indiscernible even do better than that but the increase in the revenue will more than offset the expenses as we look at now to continue to drive the efficiency ratio lower edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp we continue to look at cutting costs also in different areas mortgage area being one and we believe that that overhead ratio which i like to look at it was higher this quarter but if you take out the security loss you get closer to we have to grow also and we have to invest in growing the bank which is part of the increase in expenses hopefully that growth will get our that overhead ratio back below hard to do without mortgages kicking in but between the acquisition and of rothschild and additional asset growth wed like to get that wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 number down below i know the thatll help the efficiency ratio also but if i never considered the efficiency ratio and now its doing well well why your efficiency ratio is good because the margins are up but the net overhead ratio we need to continue to get below and were working very hard to do that christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc just one more dave on the covered calls obviously that numbers been bouncing around but how active are you going to be there and then guess maybe help us with what makes it go on either side david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp well a couple of calls as you know we do those again to protect against a down rate environment and enhance return on those securities and if youre doing them on mortgage backs of rates all the securities pay off fairly quickly and so you get that extra revenue and our analysis has been over a long period of time that youre better off by writing the calls and getting that revenue and even have to reinvest usually a better trade but as i talked about a little bit earlier when were talking about the liquidity position we invested billion of that liquidity into securities in the fourth quarter and moved some calls against that and you can see on our balance sheet those were called in and we reinvested them so it at a decent rate here in the in the first quarter so it depends on volatility and it depends on where rates or where the yield curves at but the little bit outsized from normal given the size of the investment purchases that we had but my guess is that in a normal environment that number is somewhere in the million to million range and it really it drives a lot of volatility so its hard to tell until you get to the point where you invest in securities what the yield curve shape is and what the market volatility is but somewhere in that range would seem reasonable to me operator thank you our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy of stephens your line is open terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi thanks edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc its terry mcevoy from stephens hi good morning maybe first off dave thanks for reminding me the repricing opportunities of the loan portfolio in i think its something i overlooked so i appreciate that and maybe for a question circling back i think with jons question on protecting the margin ed you kind of threw out to i just want to make sure is that the floor this strategy you think can produce and if rates go down basis points or all the way back to zero i just think thats an important kind of comment there and i want to make sure i understand what you were saying there timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 yeah just to give you terry a little bit more detail i mean weve entered into a combination of collars and some receive fixed swaps with terms out three to five years and obviously the impact of those instruments depends on the interest rate scenario so were trying to take some steps to improve a margin in lower lower interest rate environment but it depends on the scenario of how much impact theres going to be the other thing though its just not these instruments if you look at table you can see that in various scenarios both up and down weve sort of reduced the variability of the net interest income and so were mindful of trying to operate independent of the interest rate environment at the higher level david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah so and terry id add in there i mean that would sort of be the goal but were not going to do all of the derivatives all at one time were going to leg into this diversity as far as the length of these derivative contracts as far as how much fixed rate models you put on the books at what strike price these swaps or collars have they all matter and i always tell people our crystal ball isnt perfect and if you go back months i think maybe the outlook for increases in rates was basis points so the economists have put out these forecasts arent perfect either so were trying to protect the margin and so were going to leg into it so depending on what the curve is and where we can buy the swaps going forward as we leg into it from diversifying the risk perspective wed like to be able to lock it into the upper to but it really sort of is dependent upon how fast rates move and where that longer end of the curve settles out at so edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thats our goal david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp its a lofty goal were not saying weve locked that in yet but thats what wed like to do if the market sort of allows us to do that over time with these derivatives indiscernible david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah i was going to say its great i mean these are sort of unprecedented interest rate margins for us right now we have not been at in our history and so and we prepared for it weve managed for it and were enjoying that and we just would like to attempt to maintain it going forward through balance sheet position and derivatives but its going to were going to leg into it terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc yeah keep that beach ball up in the air i understand and then maybe a followup wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp indiscernible terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc just as a followup maybe just expand upon i think you hinted earlier just market dislocation disruption youre benefiting from that where specifically youre seeing that maybe some hiring efforts and within that budget expense budget for do you kind of factor in some hiring from the disruption thank you timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp the answer is yes were continuing to benefit from disruption from competitors weve talked about on prior calls obviously when relationship managers feel like they cant take care of their clients we look like a good home well continue to pursue those opportunities as they arise but its not a large team or a number youre going to see pop on the financials in a single dose terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thank you david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp were always taking advantage of market disruption even from existing players that have disruption internally so thats been part of our dna since the beginning of wintrust so we plan to keep doing it operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ben gerlinger of hovde group your line is open ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc hi thanks guys most of the questions around the margin have been answered but it reminds me of an adage my dad used to say you cant go broke by taking profit it makes sense youre going to youre willing to take a little off the upside table to protect to the downside so in essence youre kind of manufacturing to some degree a revenue line but when you think about revenue relative to expenses lets say there is that kind of the downside scenario economically or a black swan event is there anything in the net noninterest expenses that you can cut abruptly or anything to that extent that you kind of match out the two david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well on the noninterest expense side i mean were kind of a growth company so we dont plan to cut but as that so thats a big factor there is and we saw this in the past when rates dropped precipitously but the black swan event is that the mortgages kicked in dramatically we had a couple of quarters before rates went up where we had record net income quarters and thats because the mortgage business kicked in so its really shifting the wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 mix of the business from spread the business that what happened dramatically to noninterest income business which we would be the mortgage side so thats the biggest factor i would say and we its a business strategy we think we need to be in the mortgage business because were not going to send our customers to some other financial institution for a mortgage and if we think were going to do it well do it with scale and then well do it because we always want to be asset sensitive and weve said this on other calls the degree of asset sensitivity changes but you always want to be asset sensitive because if you do have inflation then your expenses are going to go up and then how do you cover that increase in expenses and for a bank like us its getting more in the margin so you should always stay asset sensitive to be able to cover the inflationary cost and if thats the case then the mortgage business is a natural business hedge and so thats how we look at it benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you okay thats helpful on the strategy and then some of your i want to say larger competitors have national deals or are involved with other ma activities themselves which gives you guys the opportunity to take clients and share the marketplace is there anything youre targeting specifically in terms of loan growth with that regard i get that you guys are all encompassing things you do a lot for a lot of people but knowing that your competitors are kind of involved with integration themselves both side of the chicago land area is there anything that you guys are approaching for in terms of the strategy to be offensive david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp no we always see opportunities that the larger banks always have various things that theyre getting involved with whether theyre pulling out of a particular asset class or changes in some of their staffing or and those really we have been the steady provider in all these different asset classes that were in so the line we use around here is that we dont jerk the wheel that we try to be very consistent in the way we underwrite the way we price the way we go to market and as a result we saw this at the back half of this year where certain banks were trying to change the way their balance sheets looked and we were able to take advantage of those so our job is just to be very consistent very steady and it just over the 30plus years that wintrust have been in existence thats really our been our model is to take what is available in the marketplace and usually thats a result of the bigger banks doing things like you refer to edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah for example one of the large banks we got the largest bank in chicago has stated theyre going to do a safe deposit banks thats an opportunity for us because all people still like safe deposit bank we got them they dont cost much to run we are now offering were going to be offering free safe deposit banks for a period time to get new people in those things like that mean a lot of people its a pain in the neck for them to change banks but the big banks seem to step on it themselves and allow us the opportunity to work through that stuff and we have great products as indicated by the ph greenwich awards and the whats indiscernible wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp jd power edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp jd power award we won last we won three of those i guess last five four or five years and people like what they hear word of mouth helps too so we think that theres plenty of offers they keep opening the door for us were going to take advantage of it benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you i appreciate the color guys thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brandon king of truist your line is open brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp good morning timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp good morning edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp how are you brandon king q analyst truist securities inc good good i had a question on mortgage just curious what was the production margin in the fourth quarter and has that bottomed in your view and outlook david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah the production margin was hovering down closer to in the fourth quarter we expect in the first quarter here at is a reasonable range which is clearly lower than normal but you also have to understand the production is very low right now as we showed in the slide deck the originations for sale were just a little over million so actually the majority of our revenue in the mortgage business now is the servicing income of roughly million wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 so first quarter we expect to be slow again although applications are still coming in theres still purchase activity out there and a little bit of a refinance activity but over of that million is really purchase volume but its competitive out there as people are just trying to get the volumes in so its squeezing the production margins so its very small but it has become such a small piece of the revenue stream that given these higher rates and seasonality in the last couple of quarters i think were about as low as were going to go as far as the production revenue i think well continue to at least have what we have now and as i said on my comments i think as we get in the second quarter and the buying season picks up and people get a little bit more used to the new level of mortgage rates and digest them i think well start to see pickup in the second and third quarters brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and then indiscernible edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp gravy for us too thats just gravy with a higher rate environment indiscernible gravy brandon king q analyst truist securities inc yeah yes yeah i agree i agree okay and then on the deposit strategy i saw a lot of deposits growth came from savings and cds i was curious if you could provide details on your cd strategy as far as what prices you book demand in the fourth quarter and as far as terms six months three months et cetera timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah rates are trending up particularly promotional rates toward most clients are still not willing to go long so youre seeing terms from nine months through call it two years but most of it kind of around a year and the alternative is there are obviously promotional money market and savings rates that are also available for people that dont want to lock into a term product david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp and the other thing i think id point you to is on table of our earnings release we do show the cd rates by maturity so you can kind of see how they roll off most of them right now our plus or minus on average and so but the promotional rates are as tim talked about brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and then for how confident are you in your ability to generate operating deposits into ddas for this year do you think youre expecting very little growth from those categories and those interestbearing accounts timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 well no were working awfully hard to continue to add clients and as we bring new clients on they bring deposits that include their operating business weve talked on prior calls about how nicely our treasury management business is performing and so again its lumpy as theres kind of large inflows and outflows but we plan to continue to add clients and deposits brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thats all i have thank you david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp thank you edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from jeff rulis of da davidson your question please jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co thanks good morning edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp good morning jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co a question a couple housekeeping items on the expense side i think you alluded to a midsingle digit expectation for the full year i think youre about for which is pretty good in the inflationary environment but what was the expectation again for david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well i was saying probably midtohigh single digits or the middle of that range sort of just normally with an acquisition that probably gets into the high single digits for the full year first quarter will probably less because the acquisition of the pending acquisition if its in there it will be the end of the first quarter or early second quarter but so it wont have much impact and so some of the increases are later in the year as we talked in our comments the second and third quarters tend to be higher for certain expense categories particularly sponsorships and marketing and then salary costs we do salary increase effective february so that will impact a little bit in the first quarter but more so the second quarter so probably not a lot of growth in the first quarter but as the year goes on for all those other reasons probably midtohigh single digits but again we would expect that with the leverage and the growth in the balance sheet and with the higher margin more than offset that expense growth wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2023 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co right i guess we get back into your comments on the efficiency ratio still seeing improvement despite a reasonably higher expense run rate so just to catch up on the margin again did you have a december average for the month david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah we dont really havent disclosed that and we dont want to get in the position of doing that i think what you can see is in the past we told you wed be around for the fourth quarter and we were and i think were pretty confident in our guidance for the full quarter of the first quarter so i think well leave it at that jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co okay fair enough and then just the last one on the tax rate any expectation that thats going to change anywhere off of is that a reasonable assumption for david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp yeah to is a reasonable assumption it bounced around a little bit because of the what we noted in the press release with the million expense in the third quarter and million of that reversing in the fourth quarter related to some minimum taxes with our canadian stuff but you take those out and to seems like a reasonable rate jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co got it thank you david alan dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp thank you operator thank you at this time id like to turn the call back over to edward wehmer for closing remarks sir edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah
