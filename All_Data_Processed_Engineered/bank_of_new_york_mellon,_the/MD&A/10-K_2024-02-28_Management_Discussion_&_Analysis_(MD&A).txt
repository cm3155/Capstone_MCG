guidance for additional information on income taxes see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements review of business segments we have an internal information system that produces performance data along product and service lines for our three principal business segments securities services market and wealth services and investment and wealth management and the other segment business segment accounting principles our business segment data has been determined on an internal management basis of accounting rather than the generally accepted accounting principles gaap used for consolidated financial reporting these measurement principles are designed so that reported results of the businesses will track their economic performance our business segments are consistent with the structure used by the president and chief executive officer our chief operating decision maker codm to make key operating decisions and assess performance our codm evaluates the business segments operating performance primarily based on fee and other revenue total revenue income before income taxes and pretax operating margin the significant expense information regularly bny results of operations continued provided to and reviewed by the codm is total noninterest expense the codm considers this information when evaluating the performance of each business segment and making decisions about allocating capital and other resources to each business segment for information on the accounting principles of our business segments the primary products and services in each line of business the primary types of revenue by line of business and how our business segments are presented and analyzed see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements business segment results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made or for refinements in revenue and expense allocation methodologies refinements are typically reflected on a prospective basis in we made certain realignments of similar products and services within our lines of business consistent with the firms ongoing transition to a platforms operating model uniting related capabilities and enabling streamlining of internal processes to drive growth efficiency resiliency and enhanced risk management the largest change was the movement of institutional solutions from pershing to clearance and collateral management both in the market and wealth services business segment we made other smaller changes that moved activity from asset servicing in the securities services business segment to treasury services in the market and wealth services business segment and from wealth management in the investment and wealth management business segment and pershing in the market and wealth services business segment to investment management in the investment and wealth management business segment the other segment was not impacted by the changes business segment results for and have been revised to reflect these changes the results of our business segments may be influenced by client and other activities that vary by quarter in the first quarter staff expense typically increases reflecting the vesting of longterm stock awards for retirementeligible employees the timing of our annual employee merit increases also impacts bny staff expense in the merit increase was effective in march and in the merit increase was effective in april thus partially impacting the fullyear staff expense variances in the third quarter volumerelated fees may decline due to reduced client activity in the fourth quarter we typically incur higher business development and marketing expenses in our investment and wealth management business segment performance fees are typically higher in the fourth and first quarters as those quarters represent the end of the measurement period for many of the performance feeeligible relationships the results of our business segments may also be impacted by the translation of financial results denominated in foreign currencies to the us dollar we are primarily impacted by activities denominated in the british pound and the euro on a consolidated basis and in our securities services and market and wealth services business segments we typically have more foreign currencydenominated expenses than revenues however our investment and wealth management business segment typically has more foreign currencydenominated revenues than expenses overall currency fluctuations impact the yearoveryear growth rate in the investment and wealth management business segment more than the securities services and market and wealth services business segments however currency fluctuations in isolation are not expected to significantly impact net income on a consolidated basis fee revenue in the investment and wealth management business segment and to a lesser extent the securities services and market and wealth services business segments is impacted by global market fluctuations at dec we estimated that a change in global equity markets spread evenly throughout the year would impact fee revenue by less than and diluted earnings per common share by to see note of

the wealth business differentiates itself with a comprehensive wealth management framework called active wealth that seeks to empower clients to build and sustain longterm wealth the results of the investment and wealth management business segment are driven by a blend of daily monthly and quarterly aum by product type the overall level of aum for a given period is determined by the beginning level of aum results of operations continued the net flows of new assets during the period resulting from new business wins and existing client inflows reduced by the loss of clients and existing client outflows and the impact of market price appreciation or depreciation foreign exchange rates and investment firm acquisitions or divestitures the mix of aum is a result of the historical growth rates of equity and fixed income markets and the cumulative net flows of our investment firms as a result of client asset allocation decisions actively managed equity multiasset and alternative assets typically generate higher percentage fees than fixed income and liabilitydriven investments and cash also actively managed assets typically generate higher management fees than indexed or passively managed assets of the same type market and regulatory trends have resulted in increased demand for lower fee asset management products and for performancebased fees investment management fees are dependent on the overall level and mix of aum and the management fees expressed in basis points onehundredth of one percent charged for managing those assets management fees are typically subject to fee schedules based on the overall level of assets managed for a single client or by individual asset class and style this is most common for institutional clients where we typically manage substantial assets for individual accounts performance fees are generally calculated as a percentage of a portfolios performance in excess of a benchmark index or a peer groups performance a key driver of growth in investment management and performance fees is the amount of net new aum flows overall market conditions are also key drivers with a significant longterm economic driver being growth of global financial assets net interest income is determined by loan and deposit volumes and the interest rate spread between customer rates and internal funds transfer rates on loans and

accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements certain of these policies include critical accounting estimates which require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods our critical accounting estimates are those related to the results of operations continued allowance for credit losses goodwill and other intangibles and litigation and regulatory contingencies management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the companys audit committee allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses covers financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost including loans and lendingrelated commitments heldtomaturity securities certain securities financing transactions and deposits with banks the allowance for credit losses is intended to adjust the carrying value of these assets by an estimated amount of credit losses that we expect to incur over the life of the asset similarly the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments and other offbalance sheet financial instruments is meant to capture the credit losses that we expect to recognize in these portfolios as of the balance sheet date a quantitative methodology and qualitative framework is used to estimate the allowance for credit losses the quantitative component of our estimate uses models and methodologies that categorize financial assets based on product type collateral type and other credit trends and risk characteristics including relevant information about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions that affect the collectability of the recorded amounts for the quantitative component we segment portfolios into various major components including commercial loans and lease financing commercial real estate financial institutions residential mortgages and other the segmentation of our debt securities portfolios is by major asset class and is influenced by whether the security is structured or nonstructured ie direct obligation as well as the issuer type the components of the credit loss calculation for each major portfolio or asset class include a probability of default loss given default and exposure at default as applicable and their values depend on the forecast behavior of variables in the macroeconomic environment we utilize a multiscenario macroeconomic forecast which includes a weighting of three scenarios a baseline and upside and downside scenarios and allows us to develop our estimate using a wide span of economic variables our baseline scenario reflects a view on likely performance of each global region and the other two scenarios are designed relative to the baseline scenario this approach incorporates a reasonable and supportable forecast period spanning the life of the asset and includes both an initial estimated economic outlook component as well as a reversion component for each economic input variable the length of each of the two components depends on the underlying financial instrument scenario and underlying economic input variable in general the initial economic outlook period for each economic input variable under each scenario ranges between several months and two years the speed at which the scenariospecific forecasts revert to longterm historical mean is based on observed historical patterns of mean reversion at the economic variable input level that are reflected in our model parameter estimates certain macroeconomic variables such as unemployment or home prices take longer to revert after a contraction though specific recovery times are scenariospecific reversion will usually take longer the further away the scenariospecific forecast is from the historical mean on a quarterly basis and within a developed governance structure we update these scenarios for current economic conditions and may adjust the scenario weighting based on our economic outlook the company uses judgment to assess these economic conditions and loss data in determining the best estimate of the allowance for credit losses and these estimates are subject to periodic refinement based on changes to underlying external or company specific historical data in the quantitative component of our estimate we measure expected credit losses using an individual evaluation method if the risk characteristics of the asset is no longer consistent with the portfolio or class of asset for these assets we do not employ the macroeconomic model calculation but consider factors such as payment status collateral value the obligors financial condition guarantor support the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due and recovery expectations if they can be reasonably estimated for loans we measure the expected credit loss as the difference between the amortized cost basis of the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows from the borrower which is generally discounted at the loans effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent we generally individually evaluate bny results of operations continued nonperforming loans as well as loans that have been modified given the risk characteristics of such loans availableforsale debt securities are recorded at fair value when an availableforsale debt security is in an unrealized loss position we employ a methodology to identify and estimate the credit loss portion of the unrealized loss position the measurement of expected credit losses is performed at the security level and is based on our best single estimate of cash flows on a discounted basis however we do not specifically employ the macroeconomic forecasting models and scenarios summarized above the qualitative component of our estimate for the allowance for credit losses is intended to capture expected losses that may not have been fully captured in the quantitative component through an established governance structure management determines the qualitative allowance each period based on an evaluation of various internal and environmental factors that include scenario weighting and sensitivity risk credit concentration risk economic conditions and other considerations we have made and may continue to make adjustments for idiosyncratic risks to the extent actual results differ from forecasts or managements judgment the allowance for credit losses may be greater or less than future chargeoffs and recoveries our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of inputs most notably the macroeconomic forecast assumptions that are incorporated into our estimate of credit losses through the expected life of the loan portfolio as well as credit ratings assigned to each borrower as the macroeconomic environment and related forecasts change the allowance for credit losses may change materially the following sensitivity analyses do not represent managements expectations of the deterioration of our portfolios or the economic environment but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses to changes in key inputs if commercial real estate property values were increased and all other credits were rated one grade better the quantitative allowance would have decreased by million and if commercial real estate property values were decreased and all other credits were rated one grade worse the quantitative allowance would have increased by bny million our multiscenario macroeconomic forecast used in determining the dec allowance for credit losses consisted of three scenarios the baseline scenario reflects positive but slightly declining gdp growth through the first quarter of before moderating stable unemployment and slightly declining commercial real estate prices through the end of the upside scenario reflects higher gdp growth through the first quarter of before moderating declining unemployment through the end of and increasing commercial real estate prices through the end of compared with the baseline the downside scenario contemplates negative gdp growth through the third quarter of before moderating rapidly increasing unemployment through the third quarter of and sharply lower commercial real estate prices through the end of compared with the baseline at dec we placed the most weight on our baseline scenario with the remaining weighting equally placed on the upside and downside scenarios from a sensitivity perspective at dec if we had applied weighting to the downside scenario the quantitative allowance for credit losses would have been approximately million higher see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses goodwill and other intangibles we initially record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions including goodwill indefinitelived intangibles and other intangibles in accordance with accounting standards codification asc business combinations goodwill indefinitelived intangibles and other intangibles are subsequently accounted for in accordance with asc intangibles goodwill and other the initial measurement of goodwill and intangibles requires judgment concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities goodwill billion at dec and indefinitelived intangible assets billion at dec are not amortized but are subject to tests for impairment annually or more often if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not they may be impaired other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying value results of operations continued goodwill bnys business segments include seven reporting units for which goodwill impairment testing is performed on an annual basis an interim goodwill impairment test is performed when events or circumstances occur that may indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit may be less than its carrying value the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired however if the carrying amount of the reporting unit were to exceed its estimated fair value an impairment loss would be recorded for the difference in each quarter of we completed an interim goodwill impairment test of the investment management reporting unit which had billion of allocated goodwill as of dec in all cases we determined the fair value of the investment management reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no goodwill impairment was recorded for the dec test the fair value of the investment management reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately we determined the fair value of the investment management reporting unit using an income approach based on managements projections as of dec the discount rate applied to these cash flows was as of dec if the discount rate applied to the estimated cash flows was increased or decreased by basis points the fair value of the investment management reporting unit would decrease or increase by respectively similarly if the long term growth rate was increased or decreased by basis points the fair value of the investment management reporting unit would increase or decrease by approximately respectively in the second quarter of we performed our annual goodwill impairment test on the remaining six reporting units using an income approach to estimate the fair values of each reporting unit estimated cash flows used in the income approach were based on managements projections as of april the discount rate applied to these cash flows was as a result of the annual goodwill impairment test no goodwill impairment was recognized the fair values of the companys remaining six reporting units were substantially in excess of the respective reporting units carrying value intangible assets key judgments in accounting for intangible assets include determining the useful life and classification between goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets or other amortizing intangible assets indefinitelived intangible assets billion at dec are evaluated for impairment at least annually by comparing their fair values estimated using discounted cash flow analyses to their carrying values as a result of the annual evaluation no impairment was recognized other amortizing intangible assets million at dec are evaluated for impairment if events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment such evaluation of other intangible assets would be initially based on undiscounted cash flow projections determining the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinitelived intangible assets is subject to uncertainty as it is reliant on estimates of cash flows that extend far into the future and by their nature are difficult to estimate over such an extended time frame in the future changes in the assumptions or the discount rate could produce a material noncash

diversified business activities include processing securities accepting deposits investing in securities lending raising money as needed to fund assets and other transactions the market risks from these activities include interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk our primary market risk is exposure to movements in us dollar interest rates and certain foreign currency interest rates we actively manage bny interest rate sensitivity and use earnings simulation and discounted cash flow models to identify interest rate exposures an earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to assess changes in pretax net interest income between a baseline scenario and hypothetical interest rate scenarios interest rate sensitivity is quantified by calculating the change in pretax net interest income between the scenarios over a 12month measurement period the baseline scenario incorporates the markets forward rate expectations and managements assumptions regarding client deposit rates credit spreads changes in the prepayment behavior of loans and securities and the impact of derivative financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes as of each respective quarterend these assumptions have been developed through a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior and are inherently uncertain actual results may differ materially from projected results due to timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and managements strategies among other factors client deposit levels and mix are key assumptions impacting net interest income in the baseline as well as the hypothetical interest rate scenarios the earnings simulation model assumes static deposit levels and mix and it also assumes that no management actions will be taken to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes typically the baseline scenario uses the average deposit balances of the quarter in the table below we use the earnings simulation model to assess the impact of various hypothetical interest rate scenarios compared to the baseline scenario in each of the scenarios all currencies interest rates are instantaneously shifted higher or lower at the start of the forecast longterm interest rates are defined as all tenors equal to or greater than three years and shortterm interest rates are defined as all tenors equal to or less than three months interim term points are interpolated where applicable the impact of interest rate shifts may not be linear the results of this earnings simulation should therefore not be extrapolated for more severe interest rate scenarios than those presented in the table below results of operations continued the following table shows net interest income sensitivity for bny affected if we do not effectively manage our liquidity estimated changes in net interest income in millions up bps rate shock vs baseline longterm up bps short term unchanged shortterm up bps long term unchanged longterm down bps shortterm unchanged shortterm down bps longterm unchanged down bps rate shock vs baseline dec sept dec at dec the changes in the impacts of a basis point upward or downward shift in rates on net interest income compared with sept were primarily driven by an increase in fixedrate assets and floating rate liabilities while the net interest income sensitivity scenario calculations assume static deposit balances to facilitate consistent periodoverperiod comparisons net interest income is impacted by changes in deposit balances and interest rate trajectory noninterest bearing deposits are particularly sensitive to changes in shortterm rates to illustrate the net interest income sensitivity to non interestbearing deposits we estimate that a billion instantaneous reductionincrease in us dollar denominated noninterestbearing deposits would reduceincrease the net interest income sensitivity results in the up basis point rate shock scenario in the table above by approximately million and in the down basis point rate shock scenario by approximately million the impact would be smaller if the reductionincrease was assumed to be a mixture of interestbearing and noninterestbearing deposits additionally during periods of low shortterm interest rates money market mutual fund fees and other similar fees are typically waived to protect investors from negative returns for a discussion of factors impacting the growth or contraction of deposits see risk factors capital and liquidity risk our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely we also project future cash flows from our assets and liabilities over a longterm horizon and then discount these cash flows using instantaneous parallel shocks to prevailing interest rates this measure reflects the structural balance sheet interest rate sensitivity by discounting all future cash flows the aggregation of these discounted cash flows is the economic value of equity eve the following table shows how eve would change in response to changes in interest rates estimated changes in eve rate change up bps vs baseline up bps vs baseline down bps vs baseline down bps vs baseline dec the asymmetrical accounting treatment of the impact of a change in interest rates on our balance sheet may create a situation in which an increase in interest rates can adversely affect reported equity and regulatory capital even though economically there may be no impact on our economic capital position for example an increase in rates will result in a decline in the value of our availableforsale securities portfolio in this example there is no corresponding change on our fixed liabilities even though economically these liabilities are more valuable as rates rise these results do not reflect strategies that management could employ to limit the impact as interest rate expectations change to manage foreign exchange risk we fund foreign currencydenominated assets with liability instruments denominated in the same currency we utilize various foreign exchange contracts if a liability denominated in the same currency is not available or desired and to minimize the earnings impact of translation gains or losses created by investments in foreign markets we use forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of our net investment in foreign operations at dec net investments in foreign operations totaled billion and were spread across foreign currencies bny
