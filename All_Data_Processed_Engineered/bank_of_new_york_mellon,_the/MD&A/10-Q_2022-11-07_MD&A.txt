note 2new accounting guidance staff accounting bulletin no in march the sec staff released staff accounting bulletin no sab sab expresses the staffs views regarding the accounting for entities that have obligations to safeguard cryptoassets held for their platform users sab provides that these entities should present a liability and corresponding asset in respect of the cryptoassets safeguarded for their platform users with the liability and asset measured at the fair value of the cryptoassets this differs from the accounting treatment of noncryptoassets held in custody which do not result in assets recorded on a custodians balance sheet we adopted the guidance in the third quarter of and recorded a de minimis asset and liability related to digital assets we safeguard note 3acquisitions

management reporting unit was determined to be below its carrying value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of million this goodwill impairment represents a noncash charge and did not affect bny mellons liquidity position tangible common equity or regulatory capital ratios we determined it was not necessary to perform an interim goodwill impairment test for our other reporting units we determined the fair value of the investment management reporting unit using an income approach based on managements projections as of sept the discount rate applied to these cash flows was compared with the discount rate used in the annual impairment test conducted in the second quarter of the increase was driven by a higher risk free rate determining the fair value of a reporting unit is subject to uncertainty as it is reliant on estimates of cash flows that extend far into the future and by their nature are difficult to estimate over such an extended time frame the cash flow estimates for the investment management reporting unit are impacted by projections of the level and mix of assets under management market values operating margins and longterm growth rates in the future changes in the assumptions or the discount rate could produce a material noncash goodwill impairment bny mellon notes to consolidated financial statements continued intangible assets the tables

consolidated financial statements continued measures risk is monitored and reported to senior management by a separate unit independent from trading on a daily basis based on certain assumptions the var methodology is designed to capture the potential overnight pretax dollar loss from adverse changes in fair values of all trading positions the calculation assumes a oneday holding period utilizes a confidence level and incorporates nonlinear product characteristics the var model is one of several statistical models used to develop economic capital results which are allocated to lines of business for computing riskadjusted performance the var methodology does not evaluate risk attributable to extraordinary financial economic or other occurrences as a result the risk assessment process includes a number of stress scenarios based upon the risk factors in the portfolio and managements assessment of market conditions additional stress scenarios based upon historical market events are also performed stress tests may incorporate the impact of reduced market liquidity and the breakdown of historically observed correlations and extreme scenarios var and other statistical measures stress testing and sensitivity analysis are incorporated into other risk management materials counterparty credit risk and collateral we assess the credit risk of our counterparties through regular examination of their financial statements confidential communication with the management of those counterparties and regular monitoring of publicly available credit rating information this and other

decreasing the amount of assets available for other liquidity needs that may arise bny mellon also offers tri party collateral agency services in the triparty repo market where we are exposed to credit risk in order to mitigate this risk we require dealers to fully secure intraday credit note 18commitments and contingent liabilities offbalance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business various commitments and contingent liabilities are outstanding that are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets our significant trading and offbalance sheet risks are securities foreign currency and interest rate risk management products commercial lending commitments letters of credit and securities lending indemnifications we assume these risks to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks to provide customers with the ability to meet credit and liquidity needs and to hedge foreign currency and interest rate risks these items involve to varying degrees credit foreign currency and interest rate risks not recognized on the balance sheet our offbalance sheet risks are managed and monitored in manners similar to those used for onbalance sheet risks notes to consolidated financial statements continued bny mellon the following table presents a summary of our offbalance sheet credit risks offbalance sheet credit risks in millions sept dec lending commitments standby letters of credit sblc a commercial letters of credit securities lending indemnifications bc a net of participations totaling million at sept and million at dec b excludes the indemnification for securities for which bny mellon acts as an agent on behalf of cibc mellon clients which totaled billion at sept and billion at dec includes cash collateral invested in indemnified repurchase agreements held by us as securities lending agent of billion at sept and billion at dec c the total potential loss on undrawn lending commitments standby and commercial letters of credit and securities lending indemnifications is equal to the total notional amount if drawn upon which does not consider the value of any collateral since many of the lending commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the total amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements a summary of lending commitment maturities is as follows billion in less than one year billion in one to five years and million over five years sblcs principally support obligations of corporate clients and were collateralized with cash and securities of million at sept and million at dec at sept billion of the sblcs will expire within one year million in one to five years and none over five years we must recognize at the inception of an sblc and foreign and other guarantees a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee the fair value of the liability which was recorded with a corresponding asset in other assets was estimated as the present value of contractual customer fees the estimated liability for losses related to sblcs and foreign and other guarantees if any is included in the allowance for lending related commitments bny mellon paymentperformance risk of sblcs is monitored using both historical performance and internal ratings criteria bny mellons historical experience is that sblcs typically expire without being funded sblcs below investment grade are monitored closely for paymentperformance risk the table below shows sblcs by investment grade standby letters of credit investment grade noninvestment grade sept dec a commercial letter of credit is normally a shortterm instrument used to finance a commercial contract for the shipment of goods from a seller to a buyer although the commercial letter of credit is contingent upon the satisfaction of specified conditions it represents a credit exposure if the buyer defaults on the underlying transaction as a result the total contractual amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements commercial letters of credit totaled million at sept and million at dec we expect many of the lending commitments and letters of credit to expire without the need to advance any cash the revenue associated with guarantees frequently depends on the credit rating of the obligor and the structure of the transaction including collateral if any the allowance for lendingrelated commitments was million at sept and million at dec a securities lending transaction is a fully collateralized transaction in which the owner of a security agrees to lend the security typically through an agent in our case the bank of new york mellon to a borrower usually a broker dealer or bank on an open overnight or term basis under the terms of a prearranged contract we typically lend securities with indemnification against borrower default we generally require the borrower to provide collateral with a minimum value of of the fair value of the securities borrowed which is monitored on a daily basis thus reducing credit risk market risk can also arise in securities lending transactions these risks are controlled through policies limiting the level of risk that can be undertaken securities lending transactions are generally entered into only with highly rated notes to consolidated financial statements continued counterparties securities lending indemnifications were secured by collateral of billion at sept and billion at dec cibc mellon a joint venture between bny mellon and the canadian imperial bank of commerce cibc engages in securities lending activities cibc mellon bny mellon and cibc jointly and severally indemnify securities lenders against specific types of borrower default at sept and dec billion and billion respectively of borrowings at cibc mellon for which bny mellon acts as agent on behalf of cibc mellon clients were secured by collateral of billion and billion respectively if upon a default a borrowers collateral was not sufficient to cover its related obligations certain losses related to the indemnification could be covered by the indemnitors unsettled repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements in the normal course of business we enter into repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements that settle at a future date in repurchase agreements bny mellon receives cash from and provides securities as collateral to a counterparty at settlement in reverse repurchase agreements bny mellon advances cash to and receives securities as collateral from the counterparty at settlement these

rulebook the ficc rules we also guarantee to ficc the prompt and full payment and performance of our sponsored member clients respective obligations under the ficc rules in connection with such clients sponsored member transactions we minimize our credit exposure under this guaranty by obtaining a security interest in our sponsored member clients collateral and rights under sponsored member transactions see offsetting assets and liabilities in note for additional information on our repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements indemnification arrangements we have provided standard representations for underwriting agreements acquisition and divestiture agreements sales of loans and commitments and other similar types of arrangements and customary indemnification for claims and legal proceedings bny mellon notes to consolidated financial statements continued related to providing financial services that are not otherwise included above insurance has been purchased to mitigate certain of these risks generally there are no stated or notional amounts included in these indemnifications and the contingencies triggering the obligation for indemnification are not expected to occur furthermore often counterparties to these transactions provide us with comparable indemnifications we are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these indemnifications for several reasons in addition to the lack of a stated or notional amount in a majority of such indemnifications we are unable to predict the nature of events that would trigger indemnification or the level of indemnification for a certain event we believe however that the possibility that we will have to make any material payments for these indemnifications is remote at sept and dec we have not recorded any material liabilities under these arrangements clearing and settlement exchanges we are a noncontrolling equity investor in andor member of several industry clearing or settlement exchanges through which foreign exchange securities derivatives or other transactions settle certain of these industry clearing and settlement exchanges require their members to guarantee their obligations and liabilities andor to provide liquidity support in the event other members do not honor their obligations we believe the likelihood that a clearing or settlement exchange of which we are a member would become insolvent is remote additionally certain settlement exchanges have implemented loss allocation policies that enable the exchange to allocate settlement losses to the members of the exchange it is not possible to quantify such marktomarket loss until the loss occurs any ancillary costs that occur as a result of any markto market loss cannot be quantified in addition we also sponsor clients as members on clearing and settlement exchanges and guarantee their obligations at sept and dec we did not record any material liabilities under these arrangements legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business the bank of new york mellon corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely named as defendants in or made parties to pending and potential legal actions we also are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations bny mellon informationgathering requests investigations and proceedings both formal and informal claims for significant monetary damages are often asserted in many of these legal actions while claims for disgorgement restitution penalties andor other remedial actions or sanctions may be sought in governmental and regulatory matters it is inherently difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of such matters given their complexity and the particular facts and circumstances at issue in each of these matters however on the basis of our current knowledge and understanding we do not believe that judgments settlements or orders if any arising from these matters either individually or in the aggregate after giving effect to applicable reserves and insurance coverage will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of bny mellon although they could have a material effect on our results of operations in a given period in view of the inherent unpredictability of outcomes in litigation and regulatory matters particularly where i the damages sought are substantial or indeterminate ii the proceedings are in the early stages or iii the matters involve novel legal theories or a large number of parties as a matter of course there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the timing or ultimate resolution of litigation and regulatory matters including a possible eventual loss fine penalty or business impact if any associated with each such matter in accordance with applicable accounting guidance we establish accruals for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters proceed to a stage where they present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable in such cases there may be a possible exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued we regularly monitor such matters for developments that could affect the amount of the accrual and will adjust the accrual amount as appropriate if the loss contingency in question is not both probable and reasonably estimable we do not establish an accrual and the matter continues to be monitored for any developments that would make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable we believe that our accruals for legal proceedings are appropriate and in the aggregate are not material to the consolidated financial position of bny mellon although future accruals could have a material effect on the results of operations in a given period in addition if we have the potential to recover a portion of an estimated loss from a third party we record a notes to consolidated financial statements continued receivable up to the amount of the accrual that is probable of recovery for certain of those matters described here for which a loss contingency may in the future be reasonably possible whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability bny mellon is currently unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for those matters described here where bny mellon is able to estimate a reasonably possible loss the aggregate range of such reasonably possible loss is up to million in excess of the accrued liability if any related to those matters for matters where a reasonably possible loss is denominated in a foreign currency our estimate is adjusted quarterly based on prevailing exchange rates we do not consider potential recoveries when estimating reasonably possible losses the following describes certain judicial regulatory and arbitration proceedings involving bny mellon mortgagesecuritization trusts proceedings the bank of new york mellon has been named as a defendant in a number of legal actions

financial reporting these measurement principles are designed so that reported results of the businesses will track their economic performance business segment results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made or for refinements in revenue and expense allocation methodologies refinements are typically reflected on a prospective basis there were no reclassification or organization changes in the third quarter of the accounting policies of the businesses are the same as those described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in our annual report the results of our business segments are presented and analyzed on an internal management reporting basis revenue amounts reflect fee and other revenue generated by each business and include revenue for services provided between the segments that are also provided to third parties fee and other revenue transferred between businesses under revenue transfer agreements is included within other fees in each segment revenues and expenses associated with specific client bases are included in those businesses for example foreign exchange activity associated with clients using custody products is included in the securities services segment net interest revenue is allocated to businesses based on the yields on the assets and liabilities generated by each business we employ a funds transfer pricing system that matches funds with the specific assets and liabilities of each business based on their interest sensitivity and maturity characteristics the provision for credit losses associated with the respective credit portfolios is reflected in each segment incentives expense related to restricted stock and rsus is allocated to the segments support and other indirect expenses including services provided between segments that are not provided to third parties or not subject to a revenue transfer agreement are allocated to the businesses based on internally developed methodologies and reflected in noninterest expense recurring fdic expense is allocated to the businesses based on average deposits generated within each business litigation expense is generally recorded in the business in which the charge occurs management of the securities portfolio is a shared service contained in the other segment as a result gains and losses associated with the valuation of the securities portfolio are generally included in the other segment client deposits serve as the primary funding source for our securities portfolio we typically allocate all interest revenue to the businesses
