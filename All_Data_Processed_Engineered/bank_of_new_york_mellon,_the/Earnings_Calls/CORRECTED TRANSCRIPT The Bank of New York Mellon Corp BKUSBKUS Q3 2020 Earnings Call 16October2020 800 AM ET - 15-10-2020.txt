think youll agree that having been in a number of business leadership roles as well as having had experience in the finance function emily brings a perspective that positions her exceptionally well for this role so welcome emily great to have you here before handing it over to her to review the financials in more detail let me touch on some highlights in terms of our performance and other developments for the third quarter we reported revenue of billion earnings per share of and a solid return on tangible common equity of our operating margin was resilient at despite the impact of low interest rates and the related money market fee waivers and with our share repurchases suspended now for two consecutive quarters we accreted significant capital increasing our common equity tier ratio to during the third quarter volumes and volatilities continued to normalize at the same time interest rates trended a bit lower as we look into next year i believe the underlying strength of our franchise will become more apparent as we expect to have most of the run rate impact of lower rates and associated money market fee waivers in our earnings the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 at that point we can start to more clearly demonstrate the progress were making around our key priorities of driving organic growth optimizing the balance sheet and executing our efficiency priorities and notwithstanding the challenging current environment our business model continues to generate significant excess capital we look forward to recommencing share buybacks as soon as regulators and market conditions allow which we expect to be meaningfully accretive to eps now there are many opportunities across our business to differentiate ourselves with clients while addressing a broader set of their needs the crisis has increased the frequency and the intensity of my conversations with clients as weve helped them navigate related issues theyre adapting to a rapidly changing environment as theyre assessing what they do across their operations they want to know how we can help them and optimize their data and how to be more efficient and effective in what they do on a daytoday basis in asset servicing we are winning and retaining more deals and our pipeline is stronger than it was at this time last year and i think thats a reflection of the quality of our service as well as the unique set of capabilities that we can deliver for the front middle and back office this is of course in addition to providing more custody and securities lending versus a year ago we are seeing positive trends in win and retention rates and in our pipeline deals are becoming more complex in cross product and solutions based for example we have recently been selected to provide a range of services by ia financial group thats one of canadas largest insurance and wealth management groups with cad billion in assets under management the mandate encompasses fund accounting and administration custody foreign exchange and a full data and analytics suite of solutions incorporating the data vault and data studio performance measurement and reporting and middle office services were continuing to invest in building out our cloudbased data and analytics offerings and have integrated this into our asset servicing core business clients trust us with trillion of data assets on our software including trillions where asset servicing is elsewhere and over of our pipeline deals now include data and analytics products just one example which i mentioned last quarter is our new esg app that allows portfolio managers to create investment portfolios customized individual esg preferences using multiple data sources with support from crowdsourced guidance around preferred esg factors and priorities were seeing real momentum with this app we have a dozen clients in active trials and we are in discussions with over more were also thinking about how we can integrate capabilities like this when developing holistic solutions for our clients in pershing the bulk of money market fee waivers is being absorbed by this business masking its underlying good performance as the core of longterm drivers remain intact the pipeline is robust and the underlying performance of the business is strong firms are critically assessing their business model and their cost structures this is particularly true with selfclearing capital markets firms that are increasingly looking to reduce cost and free up capital by outsourcing their trade settlement and clearing and turning it to us as a result of that yeartodate new assets on an annualized basis are strong at over our pipeline has further improved with an increase of almost and newly signed business from rias who increasingly value our b2b platform especially at the custodian industry consolidates weve traditionally served larger ria practices and are now expanding our addressable market to grow this client base and were maintaining our leading market share in the brokerdealer segment the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 in clearance and collateral management we serviced trillion in triparty assets globally our ongoing digital enhancements should continue to drive revenue growth from our existing client base as well as from new clients that are entering the platform as they accelerate their needs to automate operations access realtime data and focus on process optimization and digitization in this challenging operating environment our offerings which include collateral optimization and advanced analytics solutions allow clients to move from manual to automated straight through processes while optimizing their global securities inventory which has proven for them to reduce funding and operating costs and enhance their available liquidity we also expect more clients to convert balances from the bilateral repo and securities lending markets to our tri party platform as the demand rate remains high for global asset mobility and operational efficiencies that they get on triparty investment in wealth management had solid revenue growth positive longterm flows and good performance this quarter across the comp strategies by revenue which accounts for about of ims long term annualized revenue of those have pure rankings that are in the top two quartiles on a threeyear basis hanneke smits has now officially started in a role as ceo of investment management and we also recently appointed jon desimone as ceo of alcentra one of the worlds largest managers of private credit im excited to work with him to accelerate our growth by leveraging alcentras strengths in europe and increasing their market position in the us theres an opportunity to grow this manager quite a bit faster across investment management were also investing in technology and in developing offerings in etfs esg and alternatives to align our investment capabilities to evolving client demands and i think its going to nicely complement our leading positions in for example ldi active fixed income global thematic equity as well as private credit in wealth management client acquisition has started to pick up again with the resumption of socially distance inperson meetings were investing in talent initiatives such as strengthening our family office offering and technology and digital tools to support advisers and their clients we often speak about the importance of controlling expenses this is especially critical in this low rate environment we continue to identify opportunities to improve automation through operational enhancements our approach in deciding between reinvesting expense savings and allowing them to fall to the bottom line is based on a rigorous analysis including investments and prioritizing them the ones with the most attractive rois as well as taking a careful look at their payback periods were also assessing the longterm structural opportunities from this current work environment theres no question were going to have a meaningful impact on how we work in the future and well need to be agile we expect it will impact our real estate footprint our location strategy the need for contingency sites marketing and business development and acceleration of our digitization efforts with our clients now building a scalable and resilient operating model is a core part of our strategy it will enable us to optimize and streamline the interactions across our businesses technology and operations all in the interest of serving clients and driving growth now to drive and advance that agenda more rapidly we recently made the decision to bring operations and technology together under bridget engles leadership by more directly connecting operations and technology into a single operating model were taking a holistic approach to bring together the best of both functions and i think its going to give us the ability to share enterprise capabilities prioritize investments reengineer and digitize processes more quickly to drive scale and agility as well as to embed innovation and automation across endtoend client journeys and create more agile clientcentric teams the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 now let me turn to capital returns on september the federal reserve released scenarios for a second round of bank stress test and that was followed by a september announcement that share buyback and dividend increase restrictions have been extended for the fourth quarter we are now working through the analysis and the modeling as were given days from the data receipt of the scenarios to submit our plan we continue to believe that our lowrisk and highly capitalgenerative model positions us very well through this test we will commence buybacks as soon as possible with the decision to be informed by the economic and regulatory environment at the time as well as the outcome of the resubmitted capital plans based on the new scenarios in the meantime we continue to accrete significant amounts of capital the stress capital buffer ill just remind you gives us flexibility in terms of capital return timing and so it is a matter of when and not a matter of if as a reminder we also opportunistically issued billion in preferred stock during the second quarter and that will provide us with the opportunity to restack our capital once we can recommence buybacks we are committed to attractive levels of shareholder returns and we continue to aim to return at least of earnings to shareholders over time before i conclude my comments i want to welcome robin vince who has just joined us as vice chairman of bny mellon and ceo of global market infrastructure with oversight of clearance and collateral management treasury services markets and pershing bringing these complementary businesses together under his experienced leadership will better position us to become the central facilitator in our clients capital markets ecosystems across markets asset classes and geographies im excited to have robin with us hes an accomplished and respected leader in the industry who has held a number of leadership positions at goldman sachs including serving as their chief risk officer treasurer head of operations head of global money markets and ceo of the international bank im also very pleased with how the leadership team has come together its a highly talented energized and diverse group that is willing to truly challenge each other to make us all stronger to wrap up while uncertainty certainly lies in terms of how the pandemic evolves and its impact on the global economy we have also a significant uncertainty about the size and form of future stimulus programs as well as political developments but given that i am certain that the team we have in place will continue to navigate these challenges by executing on our strategic priorities i am also proud that our employees across the company have worked diligently throughout this unprecedented time to provide great client service we entered this crisis from a position of strength and have an unwavering focus on building ever greater value for our stakeholders going forward so with that ill turn it over to emily emily h portney chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thank you todd for the kind introduction and good morning everyone let me run through the details of our results for the quarter all comparisons will be on a yearoveryear basis unless i specify otherwise the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 beginning on page two of the financial highlights document in the third quarter of we reported revenue of billion down less than and eps of as expected revenues were negatively impacted by low interest rates and associated money market fee waivers excluding these marketdriven factors underlying fees would have been up reflecting good momentum across many of our businesses expenses were up however it is important to note that of the increase was driven by the taxrelated reserve release in the third quarter of pretax margin was and we posted rotce of and roe of provision for credit losses was million we continue to accrete substantial excess capital and are in a good position to resume buybacks when regulators and market conditions allow quarteroverquarter both our cet1 and tier leverage ratios improved meaningfully by and basis points respectively page sets out a trend analysis of the main drivers of the quarterly results investment services revenue was billion down net interest revenue was down while fees were down including the impact of money market fee waivers we saw a healthy underlying growth across asset servicing pershing treasury services and corporate trust which i will discuss later investment and wealth management revenue increased largely driven by higher market values and we also continue to see strong investment performance in our largest strategies with positive longterm flows this quarter the impact of money market fee waivers on our consolidated fee revenue net of distribution and servicing expense was million in the quarter slightly better than the million to million that we previously guided to and an increase of million quarteronquarter we provided you detail of the impact by business and the expense in the appendix of this highlights deck finally despite the contraction in high margin revenues this year from lower interest rates and more recently the absence of share buybacks pretax income margins and eps are healthy although down versus a year ago slide summarizes the pl and notable items in the year ago period there were two largely offsetting items but relevant as we look at various components of the pl one is the lease impairment negatively impacting nir in the third quarter of and the other is a net reduction of reserves that benefited im expense in the prior year quarter turning to slide our capital and liquidity ratios remain strong and well above internal targets and regulatory minimums common equity tier capital totaled just over billion at september and our cet1 ratio was under the advanced approach and under the standardized approach as a reminder under the new stress capital buffer rules that became effective october we are required to maintain a standardized cet1 ratio of including the stress capital buffer floor and a gsib surcharge tier leverage is currently our binding constraint due to the buffers we need to hold for potential growth in our deposit basedriven balance sheet we are comfortable operating at a ratio of around to versus the regulatory minimum at our current tier leverage ratio is well above our target and we expect to accrete more capital in the fourth quarter finally our average lcr in the third quarter was in terms of shareholder capital return in the third quarter we continued our suspension of share repurchases and will do so again in the fourth quarter in line with federal reserve restrictions for ccar banks we continued to the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 pay our quarterly cash dividend which totaled million audio gap and believe we have ample capacity to continue to pay dividends under a variety of economic scenarios turning to page my comments on net interest revenue will highlight the sequential changes net interest revenue of million was down this was within the range we provided for the second quarter results despite rates coming in a little lower than was implied by the forward curve at the time we offset some of this impact through implementation of balance sheet optimization strategies a full quarter of lower libor as well as lower rates in general reduced the yield on securities portfolio loans and other interestearning assets for example average one and threemonth libor levels were down bps and bps respectively the lower asset yield impact was partially offset by the related benefits of lower funding costs the rate environment also drove mbs prepayment activity slightly higherthanexpected for the quarter as i said we were able to offset some of the rate headwinds through the deployment of cash into a larger securities portfolio as more of our deposit balances seasoned additionally we benefited from a decline in longterm debt outstanding turning to slide which summarizes deposits and securities trends average deposit balance has remained strong at billion up versus the third quarter of deposit growth reflects the success of our deposit initiatives linked to feegenerating transaction activities that weve had in place for a year now across treasury services asset servicing and wealth management it is also partly attributable to central bank balance sheet expansion which results in excess liquidity in the system the average rate paid on interestbearing deposits declined very modestly to negative basis points during the quarter and reflected some pricing optimization in a few businesses at this point we generally feel that weve now reached the low point for deposit pricing recall that the negative rate paid reflects our business mix approximately of our deposits are nonus dollar and we charge negative rates on eurodenominated deposits turning to the securities portfolio on average the portfolio increased approximately billion versus the second quarter and was around billion over the prior year or nearly higher as we deployed the growing deposit base average nonhqla securities including trading assets were billion in the third quarter up from billion a year ago as weve been buying some incremental nonhqla securities to increase yields while maintaining our conservative risk profile moving to page which provides some color on our asset mix and our loan portfolio our average interest earning assets were relatively stable at billion but as i mentioned we did redeploy some cash into investment securities this quarter the loan portfolio represents just of our interestearning assets we continue to feel good about our credit exposures and the portfolio continues to perform well so at zero net chargeoffs this year we will continue to closely monitor the portfolio particularly their commercial real estate exposure and other sectors more acutely impacted by the current environment provision for credit losses reflected a fairly consistent macroeconomic outlook versus the prior quarter and a modest net uptick in reserves primarily related to our cre portfolio page provides an overview of expenses expenses of billion were up of the increase was driven by the taxrelated reserve reduction last year in investment management the remainder of the increase was the the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 result of continued investments in technology and the impact of a weaker us dollar partially offset by lower staff and business development expenses namely travel and marketing turning to page total investment services revenue declined as almost all business revenue growth rates were impacted by yearoveryear lower net interest revenue assets under custody andor administration increased yearoveryear to trillion and we continue to see organic growth with new and existing clients as well as the benefit from higher market values and the impact of a weaker us dollar as i move to the business line discussion i will focus my comments on fees within asset servicing overall fees increased slightly primarily on organic growth with existing clients and higher market levels these increases were partially offset by lower securities lending revenue due to tighter spreads as well as marginally lower foreign exchange revenue on the back of lower industry volumes despite higher volatility in fx markets other trading revenue was down driven by fixed income trading activities which is offset in nir in pershing fee revenue decreased as the impact of fee waivers more than offset good organic growth transaction volumes clearing accounts mutual fund assets and sweep balances all increased and net new assets were billion in the quarter yeartodate the pipeline has further improved as the business continues to gain momentum issuer services fees revenue decreased by driven by depository receipts based on a slowdown in cross border settlement as well as seasonal dividend and other corporate action activity due to macro uncertainty trends in dr masked good underlying momentum in corporate trust as demonstrated by new business wins and client deposit growth and corporate trust fees were modestly higher treasury service and fee revenue was up despite the tough macroeconomic environment and lower overall payment activity primarily due to higher liquidity balances which grew over yearoveryear net new business and an improvement in product mix clearance and collateral management fees were impacted by lower revenue of million driven by the divestiture of its equity investment in the fourth quarter of last year as well as the subdued activity in the us treasury market despite higher issuance levels and secondary trading and therefore settlement activity was lower these headwinds were partially offset by higher nonus dollar collateral management fees page summarizes the drivers that affected the yearoveryear revenue comparisons for each of our investment services businesses turning to investment and wealth management on page total investment and wealth management revenue was up overall assets under management of trillion are up yearoveryear primarily due to higher markets the impact of the us dollar weakening and cash inflows from earlier this year we had net outflows of billion in the quarter the longterm strategy had been inflows of billion including significant ldi inflows from targeted clients investment management revenue was up driven mainly by higher market values the favorable impact of a weaker us dollar and uptick in performance fees and the absence of the impact of hedging activity that occurred a year ago this offset higher money market fee waivers wealth management revenue was down yearoveryear while fees were flat and higher market levels were offset by net outflows partially due to client tax payments and a shift by clients to lower fee investment products the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 in the quarter there were million of seed capital hedging losses that were more than offset by gains on seed capital the net of these items was reflected in other fee revenue within the segment as a reminder in the consolidated financial statements the results of the seed capital hedges are in foreign exchange and other trading and the seed capital gains are reflected in income from consolidated investment management funds and investment and other income in the third quarter last year there was also a revenue hedge in one of the investment management boutiques which has been eliminated now turning to our other segment on page the yearoveryear revenue comparison was primarily impacted by the lease related impairments of million recorded in the third quarter of last year while expenses declined primarily due to lower staff expense and now a few comments about the fourth quarter first i would note that the macroeconomic environment remains fluid although we are expecting higher volatility in the fourth quarter around the elections it is difficult to predict whether this will translate into higher transaction volumes or whether it will be a risk off environment looking ahead at net interest revenue we expect nirs decline sequentially by to as we look into next year we expect the quarterly nir run rate to be slightly less than the fourth quarter level this is based on a few factors first the forward curve indicates a fairly stable rate environment from here implying that the work should be behind us second we continue to take action and optimize the securities and loan portfolio as the positive season generating marginally higher yield third the unrealized gains associated with the higher yielding longterm securities will take some time to roll off fourth we do not expect further deleveraging and additionally our deposit balances remained strong and are slightly higher than the third quarter average we expect them to remain at these levels in the fourth quarter we continue to expect money market fee waivers net of distribution expense benefits to being the original range indicated at to million as we look into the next year we expect waivers to be fully incorporated into our run rate at the higher end of that range waivers will also start to impact investment services businesses aside from pershing to a greater extent and on full year expenses excluding notable items we expect this to remain essentially flat versus including the basis points all yearoveryear impact from higher pension expense we maybe up slightly if there is a weakening of the us dollar but this of course would be largely offset on the revenue line which would benefit from a weakening us dollar credit costs will be highly dependent upon individual credits and other macroeconomic development in terms of our effective tax rate we still expect to be approximately for the full year although it was lower this quarter with that operator can you please open the line for questions the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 question and answer section operator thank you operator instruction we will take our first question comes from alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great good morning thanks todd and welcome emily so first question for you guys i was hoping to go back to opening comments around how the challenging rate backdrop and obviously market challenge in the beginning of the year perhaps masking some of the growth initiatives that are taking place underneath it sounds like todd youre a little bit more optimistic about that into next year so can you help us contextualize which specific initiatives from a topline perspective you expect to be the most material contributors to certain top line growth into and over time again given numerous things you mentioned where do you see is a reasonable organic fee growth for the firm excluding sort of the market dynamics thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure alex good morning good to hear from you i think probably the most impactful one is around pershing and so and we did call out the details around pershing so as weve been investing in the advisory space and we are seeing some good growth and some good wins there yeah we saw on a yearoveryear basis a decline in fees but theres about million of fee waivers that are reflected there so if you adjust for that there is actually pretty healthy growth so we continue to see that as a potential upside and itll be good to get these fee waivers behind us because the masking of whats lying underneath will go away i think secondly in asset servicing were seeing the same effect where were starting to see a little bit of fee waivers obviously were seeing a lot of net interest income impact and theres a little bit of other noise i mean we had divested of an asset that was driving that fee line a year ago we took a big gain in the fourth quarter but there was some income related to that that we would have enjoyed in the third quarter thats no longer there but when we look at what we see going on there we do see some traction around our data and analytics space we i mean one and also one of the important things there and one of our key strategies is quality of service and the quality of our service and the feedback that were getting from clients continues to improve it helps not only the retention of business but new business especially with existing clients and were starting to see that come through the line and a bit of that is masked on the clearing and collateral management space where were making significant investments and what were calling the future of collateral which will make that business much more interoperable and beneficial to our clients we see some growth opportunities this particular quarter was pretty soft for that i mean again we had divested of an asset that was reflected in that line we also and this is kind of surprising just the clearing of volumes in the treasury market despite the massive increases in issuance by the us government they were down it was kind of quiet quarter when it came to the clearing and collateral management business and the the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 clearing business in particular we saw a very modest increase in global collateral but domestic collateral management was down a little bit as we saw some deleveraging so there are a number of things masking that i think well be able to pick up market share in the future and i think well also be able to pick up a movement from bilateral to triparty because of the efficiencies that theyre going to get on our platform so i think those are a couple of the key points alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and i guess just putting it all together and not to pinpoint or as you think about the collection of businesses that you guys have what do you think is the reasonable organic fee growth that we should anticipate from bny mellon overtime thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i dont think i want to put down on to guidance at this point but when we look to this year theres a modest amount or underlying kind of organic fee growth a lot of it masked by all those things i just described alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks very much operator we will take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning todd and emily thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning betsy emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc todd you mentioned the buyback when the gates are lifted from the fed and i just wanted to understand how quickly you would be willing to buyback the stock down to the tier leverage ratio of what i think its that youre using as your self imposed minimum there thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 well first of all wed like to get started as obviously as soon as we can the guidance that that emily gave is as a target and right now our constraint is the tier leverage ratio as we go through the stress test thats historically what its been and we gave guidance that we think we should target somewhere between the and range and were currently at and growing that being said the reason we give guidance in that range is right now our as you know our balance sheet is a bit bloated because of all of the liquidity that the fed has put in place so in this kind of environment where weve already felt the sharp increase in deposits they come with the market environment we wouldnt expect another course of that so we probably be willing to move toward the middle or lower end of that target so that being said well have to look at market conditions at the time when the fed lifted the restrictions see what the economy is doing what we think is going on with the balance sheet and wed absolutely be willing to start moving aggressively betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so if there was another fiscal plan that came through that doesnt really impact your deposits obviously as much as the fed and increasing the size of the balance sheet so another round of fiscal stimulus doesnt really drive up your deposits you dont have to worry about that too much is that one of the takeaways there thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp i think thats right betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay okay thanks and then on the followup question just on how were thinking about reinvesting the cash you have on the balance sheet maybe emily you can speak to how youre thinking about redeploying that into securities you talked about having nim next year or i should say nii next year be running at a little bit less than the run rate so im expecting that some of that cash redeployment will be occurring maybe if you give us some color as to how youre thinking about that the pace and how much of your cash you are willing to redeploy into securities emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure good to hear from you betsy ultimately we have been talking about for some time we have been looking to redeploy the excess cash that we have and of course as deposits do begin to season we have an ability to do that we have been increasing the amount of high quality nonhqla in the portfolio on a marginally quarteron quarter and actually yearoveryear thats up about billion and so its a mixture of growing the portfolio investing in growing the nonhqla around the edges extending duration and the only other thing i would say is we its not just about the securities portfolio but its also about the loan portfolio so we are redeploying some of our deposits into our loan portfolio which of course also helps with client services and in client relationships betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 operator we will take our next question from glenn schorr with evercore isi glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks just a followup on a capital and todd weve talked about this a little bit in the past but i get it you got tons and you keep making more and the buybacks awfully enticing and accretive im curious on how you guys balance that with the potential to deploy capital into something else that could accelerate growth andor improve the overall mix of the company thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yes okay glenn yeah thanks for the question were constantly looking at what opportunities lie out there for us and we take and what id say glenn is we take a very careful look at it and i think very disciplined approach to how we would look at something inorganic were certainly not opposed to it from timetotime we see certain types of actions and lift outs that might make some sense to us but frankly we compare them to a capital return and they should be able to be the longterm eps growth that wed otherwise get buying back our shares so we hold ourselves very strictly to that discipline there may be and we did things through the financial crisis there may be opportunities here to do something weve got a team thats constantly evaluating whether its in the fintech space whether its extending a market whether its doing something and adjacency to what were currently looking at so were absolutely willing to consider things but they have to make sense for the longterm growth of the company glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay i appreciate that maybe just one quickie on issuer services which i know its hard with the crystal ball but weve had a big surge in debt issuance this year im curious on how you think about just the overall business growth going into next year what you see as pulled forward versus just a still good issuing environment thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure so in our issuer services weve actually got two businesses in that segment weve got the corporate trust business which youre referring to but we also have the dr the depositary receipt business the dr business was as you might expect was quite a bit softer a lot of that is international it related to international equities obviously and the volume and dividends and the action there was down so we generate a lot of revenue off of the corporate actions in the third quarters typically a pretty good quarter it was still up sequentially but it was down substantially yearoveryear so that kind of masks the underlying performance of corporate trust we think corporate trust continues to we picked up a little bit of market share in some of the core businesses frankly we had lost our mojo a couple of years ago and i think weve gotten it back and were seeing some growth there and the opportunity and the issuance that has taken place has been significant its not the highest yielding type of issuance but as we start to see some more structured product and the credit product come back we think were well positioned to capture that growth theres a little this is another one of the businesses that does is impacted by fee waivers so a little bit of that will be masked by fee waivers over the next quarter or two and thats why in my opening remarks i said im looking forward to getting that ph reset done having the fee waivers fully priced into the run rate as the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 well as the lower interest rates and our net interest income and we expect to see that probably sometime early next year glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks todd thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks glenn operator we will take our next question from mike carrier with bank of america michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning and thanks for taking the questions first just given the net interest revenue and waiver pressures just curious if theres any other efficiency initiatives across the board to reduce expenses heading into despite some of the investments that you guys talk about making for the business to drive growth emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp ill take that so yes we do have many efficiency initiatives that are actually ongoing and ultimately whether it is and i think weve talked in previous forums whether its investments that weve made in terms of automating client inquiries handsfree nav and various other initiatives those are all things that are coming look we do expect they already are coming through our cost line the benefit and they will continue to come through the cost line the other thing i would just say is that in this year we probably not probably we reached our peak of investment in resiliency that doesnt mean were going to stop investing we will continue to invest in resiliency but we reached the peak investment so that will abate a bit and give us some room and likewise we have ultimately various different initiatives across the business from a structural perspective as were looking at the potential permanent impact of covid on real estate footprint as well as sales and marketing expenses and other digitization efforts that are accelerating with our clients thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah mike if i could add to that one of the things that we did in the quarter is i named bridget engle head of tech and ops she was previously head of technology and by bringing tech and ops together and ops covers most of the operations of the company i think the opportunity to automate to work more closely together to really target where were going to invest in our automation process we still do theres still lots of lowlying fruit on that tree because we still do unfortunately have a lot of manual processes things that we can do more efficiently so by putting tech and ops together and bridget engle working with our head of operations ann fogarty that much more closely i think well be able to identify and execute more quickly on some of these efficiencies the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 i mean weve been moving pretty well its basically funded the significant increase in our technology expenses over the last few years we do think those increases are going to abate theyre not going to be at the same rate its probably been at a compounded annual growth rate for a number of years here and so that puts us in a position to keep grinding through it michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch all right thats helpful and then just a followup given some of the noise with the waivers and ph even volatility levels throughout the year just curious how pricing has been trending in asset servicing over the past six or so months and then just in terms of going forward any expected changes or any expected kind of surges in ph your contract negotiations that could move it one way or another emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure mike ill take that obviously asset servicing is a pretty mature business so repricing is just a continual headwind although its pretty modest and we have not seen a change in the amount really from a percentage basis and impact on revenues for several years so its not any worse than it has been as you do rightfully point out though it is lumpy and as bigger contracts do come up for renewal that can be lumpy thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp but the pipeline michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch indiscernible thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah the pipeline is strong and when we look at the pipeline a very high percentage of them now i think over of it is looking at our data and analytics offerings so were really starting to see that pick up and if you look at i mean i think the best way to evaluate the business is from the operating margins and the operating margins arent under pressure because of pricing theyre under pressure because of the cyclical nature of interest rates in that business michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thanks a lot operator we will take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi well i guess there are some factors you have difficulty controlling some factors that you ph can control you mentioned once interest rates settle down well see some more of the benefits you guided for lower the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 nii ahead though so the first question is when do you think that youll see the full negative impact of interest rates in the run rate so we can see the underlying progress come through and then ill ask a second question emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp go ahead emily emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure mike good to hear from you so look im not going to try to call the market or the timing on the trough in rates but as we did just guide in our prepared remarks we think that the fourth quarter nir will probably be anywhere from to down from this quarter and ultimately we do think its probably a pretty good estimate to use slightly lower than what the fourth quarters meant to be or what we expect it to be to project out the rest of next year thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so basically were saying mike thats something slightly under the fourth quarter run rate but thats making the assumption that the forward yield curve is reflected in what actually happens emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp and just to add to that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so no improvement in rates it just reflects where the market is today emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp exactly mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay theres only so much you can do about that i guess but on the other question assets under custody youre up yearoveryear and your investment servicing revenues are down yearoveryear and this is not a new issue for you or any of these trust banks but how can you grow the investment servicing business while also growing investment servicing revenues the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 you mentioned todd youve gained share in the trust business but there seems to be a disconnect between auc growth and the revenues related to that is that just competition and can you change your fee model or how you charge your customers it seems like your customers are getting the better end of the arrangement thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah sometimes it feels that way theres a little bit of noise mike in that line and in the when we look at the asset servicing fees in the corporate line rather than in the segment that reflects the clearing and collateral management business as well and the clearing and collateral management business in the third quarter didnt have a very good quarter i think there was a divestiture that took place and we lost a significant amount of revenue there but the activity was actually pretty depressed in the quarter which is kind of a surprise because even though the us governments issuing a significant amount of additional treasuries the actual trading around that was a little bit less than we would have anticipated and there were some other impacts there the other thing in that line is securities lending and securities lending again volumes are up thats another interest rate and marketrelated issue the reinvestment rates are significantly down so the spreads are down and we didnt see many things in the way of special so there is a little bit of the deleveraging so if you adjust for that we dont see anything substantially different in the pricing or the operating margins underlying operating margins except for some of the cyclical effects that i just pointed out that being said it puts us in a position should we price to assume that those cyclical pressures are going to remain forever or should we price maintaining the optionality that were going to have on the upside and competition will help us drive that but were going to do what we think will be in the longterm interest with those clients mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay i guess that leads to why youre putting so much effort on the efficiency i mean we dont have the earnings from investment servicing you dont break it out to that detail but we still get even after adjusting for securities lending and these other factors theres still auc is growing faster than the revenues from it right and so thats why youre trying to improve efficiency anything about earnings related to that business is it keeping pace because again we dont have it at that level and thats a core function of what you guys do thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah no i think we its a meaningful contributor to the overall performance of the company i think we are continuing to get more efficient but we also have some other investments that we think that we can expand the revenue stream as we provide more capabilities around data management for example were starting to see a little bit of traction there some of the applications i described one on the in my earlier remarks where weve got an esg app that i think is really starting to gain some traction weve got clients now operating on it weve got maybe demos that weve given very good tickup on that we have another app on distribution analytics which i think can really help our clients increase their distribution and thats how you really build out relationships so theres things that were trying to generate more revenues as the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 we take on more of the operational burden from our clients but at the same time we are the throughput is going up without significant increases in costs so yes we are driving down our per unit cost meaningfully mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator we will take our next question from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my question i just want to followup on nii emily thank you for providing taking a stab at and appreciate that youre using the forward curve so just was curious about what assumptions are also embedded for mbs prepayment activity in that it seems as though more recently that was a bit of a surprise versus some of maybe what the thirdparty data sources had been expecting are you expecting that that will continue to accelerate and then when you talk about the lending and some balance sheet optimization into lending is that on the margin loan side or is that elsewhere because it looks like the margin loan yield is holding up better than the prior reserve period so curious if thats sustainable is that some mix or some color on that front thank you emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure sure ill try to take both of those in terms of mbs prepayments just for what its worth they accelerated about more than we originally expected and that is part of the headwind on nir at least in the third quarter in terms of as we think about as we go through next year we do expect it to slow modestly so thats in our projection and then i guess in terms of your question with regard to lending we actually at the minute our lending portfolio is relatively flat at billion youll see probably growth in that as we get into next year again more marginally we dont lead with lending its certainly something that we do to strengthen relationships that we have with our clients and the places where we really see a lot of or some opportunities in the act lending space well basically mortgages in wealth and also supply trade finance in treasury services thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah and i would add to that brennan that interestingly in the big drawdowns that we had on the corporate committed facilities of those have been paid back so weve seen that loan part of the loan portfolio go down so i think thats kind of the noise associated with that thats been stabilized but we would like to continue to grow and well do it prudently the margin lending business its a very low risk its a decent return wed like to see some more act lending which is something that looks akin to that as well as the supply chain and mortgages and wealth that we talked about brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 all right thats really helpful thanks for that color and then when we think of like taking a step back here rates are tough and clearly more environmental than something that specifically you guys are doing but a big part of your economic model is embedded within rates because of the deposit spreads embedded within your the returns that you generate from your clients and so this period feels sort of different than when we went into the last one the last one was viewed as temporary its just something we need to get through and then were going to come out on the other side and well return to a normal environment and that position has come under a pretty significant question so i guess what i would say is what are you how are you thinking about making adjustments to the pricing model how are you thinking about reconsidering some of the economic considerations when you assess clients and what are your assumptions for where deposit spreads would return to just to ensure that the new business that you win the assessment of existing relationships remains reasonably calibrated to what is the likely environment unfortunately were going to be in for a while i know its a tough one but just curious your thoughts thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah so yeah i think that the general feeling and ours is as well is that rates are lower for longer by the way the last cycle they were low for a fairly substantial period of time that being said we see the light at the end of the tunnel for the fully baked in impact of interest rates today and its from there that well grow so we will take into consideration what the market implies in interest rates as we price activity going forward and thats reflected in all of our pricing assumptions and weve also got a whole series of initiatives that we think will give us deeper relationships and add revenue streams as we look there out so we do see the potential for some margin expansion we see the potential for some revenue growth we see the benefits of our operating efficiencies it really just points back to our key priorities theres a handful of organic growth initiatives that weve got in place theyre not all going to pay out but some of them will and the activity levels are still high what we do is important and its growing i mean if you look at the pershing marketplace the advisory business is growing rapidly and we think we can capture more of that theres been a consolidation amongst custodians thats an interesting opportunity for us so its ph not always with us we understand weve got an interest rate headwind we want to get it behind us and move off a bit and grow the company from there brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for the color operator we will take our next question from brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi great thanks good morning folks first of all thanks for the extra disclosure on the money market fee waivers and emily on the balance sheet strategy definitely very helpful the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 maybe going into pershing picking off starting with that last with your last answer todd within that opportunity within the ria custodian space is first of all i missed one number youve quoted earlier i dont know if it was the billion of net new assets in that business but if its something different if you could repeat that and then the question really is more of the opportunity going forward on that i guess the timeline of it are you have you benefited from that significantly already or do you think that were in the early innings of the ria market share gain there and are you doing anything differently than you had in the past in that business to try to win that business from the other custodians thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah no your number was correct and yes we are investing more significantly in the business were investing in both sales marketing as well as the platform that supports the advisory business and weve got plans to do more and to continue capturing market share were doing the pipeline is strong theres another space there that i really didnt even mention and that is institutional clearing its something that were uniquely positioned to do and were seeing more and more as even bigger brokerdealers look to outsource trying to reduce some of the capital requirements and balance sheet requirements as well as just gaining efficiencies and the connectivity that pershing has to our own clearing and collateral and triparty business is a unique offering so we see opportunities there as well brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and so is there some confidence that you can outweigh the fee waivers in that segment over the next few quarters potentially from the organic growth thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp its going to be difficult in the shortterm thats why i want to get them behind us as i just indicated brian on a yearoveryear basis that fee waiver was million in the quarter million in the quarter for pershing brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp once we get absolutely once we get that set then were working back to recover it brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 yeah that makes sense and then your comments on the data offering of the pipeline can you just talk about the role of aladdin within that i know youve integrated that into some of the servicing ph pricing and you also mentioned the esg app thats obviously starting still in early phase but maybe if you can talk about what youre doing there is that aggregating data from the other esg services or are you actually putting a proprietary analytical engine on the esg that might generate some additional growth and are you beginning to charge for that yet thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah so brian let me focus on the esg app first so its a little bit of both so basically the client brings the license to us so we have integrated or well connect to as many as different esg data providers and weve built a whole well use the united nations factors or well also kind of customize factors that are most frequently used and so you can run your own analytics against those factors probably the neatest thing that weve done against it is we built a crowdsourcing app as well so theres a sharing of which factors which data suppliers appear to be the most trusted and it also shows you how much data there is on each of the factors that youre looking at so whether you can even trust that factor or not and when theres a lack of information or the quality of information is challenged by the crowd were feeding that information back to the data providers so they can constantly improve it so we think its pretty innovative its and the were agnostic to where the data is they can feed it to us if were the custodian we can flip the switch and turn it on for them so thats the that particular app do you have anything to add emily emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp can i take the oms side thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay go ahead emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so weve actually seen a very nice uptick in terms of or tick up i should say in terms of our partnerships with the various omss and by the way just as a reminder its not just aladdin but we have a partnership with bloomberg simcorp crd as well as ssc so were really about open architecture and we think that our integration is more robust we truly have integrated through single signon and the data feeds also across more asset classes and ultimately its not only beneficial to us but its also beneficial to those service providers and the last thing i would just mention about open architecture its not just about the front end its actually about throughout the entire life cycle the investment life cycle so weve got also agreements and partnerships with many fintechs ezops milestone kingfield and others brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thats very helpful thank you the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks brian operator we will take our next question from ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi good morning thanks for taking my questions todd you mentioned earlier that a couple of the businesses were just kind of quiet this quarter i wanted to ask you just a bigger question when you think across the businesses the activitydriven businesses versus the really strong first quarter things have kind of settled down do you get a you get a sense that we kind of are now at normal levels of activity when you think across the more transactional parts of the company thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah hey ken so i said the answer to that is yes and id also say the third quarter was i mean typically its a little bit of a seasonal quarter to slow down into vacation we actually saw that this quarter and versus a year ago where you had the blip in the repo markets and some unusual things and some unusual revenues related to that we didnt see this looked more like the seasonality that we would typically see in the quarter so it feels at least for the time being that there is a level of normalcy around the volumes and activity ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and a followup on the buyback todd loud and clear that youre ready to go would there be anything if the fed were to lift the buyback restriction after is it just onto your own decisioning from there is there anything either politically or regulatory that could get in the way of you guys just ready to plough back into the buyback and related how would you start to think about if you were able to get back in do you go right back to buying back total capital return or do you have to kind of leg in thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yes so i mean one of the benefits of the new regime once it gets fully implemented the stressed capital buffer its no longer a program where we submit a plan with x amount of buybacks by period and if we vary from that plan we have to make an adjustment or a resubmission it is we have to maintain our stress capital buffer and so were not restricted by timing and the implications of that so we actually we think its a very logical approach and we look forward to operating within it because i think it gives us more of the agility that youre pointing to there ken now in terms of indiscernible consequences or were i mean thats really outside of our control the fed is meant to be an apolitical institution and i think they will go through the stress test theyll make their assessments and they will determine what actions they are going to permit ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 got it and just one final clean up just on the any change in your outlook for the tax rate or can you just help us understand what that outlook is thanks emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp its still i think we guided already its still for the full year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thank you thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks ken operator we will take our next question from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp morning steven steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so i wanted to start off with a question on capital emily i appreciate you drawing a line in the sand outlining the roughly bps to bps of excess tier leverage you have today admittedly like when we start to run various scenarios in terms of significant deposit uplift and if there is like a negative market shock that we ultimately experience that to target it still feels quite conservative and just wanted to get some context as to why you feel thats the appropriate level that you need to manage to and how could that potentially evolve over time if you find that the deposits prove to be stickier and the balance sheet volatility ultimately proves to be less as the covid pressure starts to abate emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure i can take that and todd you can add if you want in terms of just worth mentioning from a deposit perspective our deposits are trending about up from where they were in the second quarter so there that just thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp in the third quarter the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sorry in the third quarter apologies in the third quarter theyre currently around up and ultimately when it comes to just thinking about the tier leverage you are correct it is our binding constraint having said that we have done very well on all of our stress tests which have taken into account very severe market shocks and we do feel that the buffer that weve talked about is certainly sufficient and you are correct that were running above that and as a result our excess certainly excess capital to make others an additional surge in deposits thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah id add to that steven its a when you look at your capital ratios you have to look at them kind of bau and current operating conditions so weve got a massive excess relative to that and if you and to your point is it more stable well weve already gotten a significant uptick due to the activities coming out of the fed and fiscal is probably not going to have anything like that to the underlying deposit base so were really positioned to handle growth but we also have to run it through the stress test so its not just normal business conditions put through stress that tier leverage ratio could be a constraint and thats what were pointing out so the buffer reflects both what could be an increase in the deposits for any particular sharp upturn as well as what we need just to meet to run a traditional stress test steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for all that color and just one followup from me regarding some of the discussion regarding some of the organic fee green shoots that were cited earlier and over the last couple of years ppnr has contracted its almost been exclusively driven by nii and interest rate pressures core fees have been running flattish expenses have also been running flattish and youve tried to maintain discipline there as we think about a scenario where say in months if some of those organic fee green shoots that were cited if were still running at flattish fee income just want to get a sense as to how youre thinking philosophically about how you want to manage the expense base and if were not seeing that pickup in organic fee growth how your philosophy around that might evolve thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay ill make a couple of comments when you look at that fee growth its also absorbing and we pointed to million fee waivers per quarter so thats an enormous number so underneath that there has to be some growth in order to sustain where we are and we think were going to be able to continue that obviously based on conditions and what actually happens to revenues well take a harder and harder look at expenses weve been able to make the investments in technology resiliency automation cyber everything that weve done to make ourselves a stronger company i got to admit it it actually is more and more important having gone through this last crisis as clients see the benefit of resiliency of a global operating model that was able to meet huge increases in volumes and so if anything i think well probably see more as a result of that so weve been able to do all of that and manage the expenses and well drop more to the bottom line based on what happens to the revenue picture the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc great thanks for taking my questions thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks steven operator we will take our next question from brian kleinhanzl with kbw brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks good morning just quick question on the asset management business i know there was a restructuring there in the past and combining some of the boutiques that you had standalone but now what weve seen across the asset management space is certainly more interest in consolidation so i guess can you maybe address that from both sides of it like whats the opportunity to one do acquisitions and whats the appetite as well to maybe get rid of potentially divest some of these businesses within asset management thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure brian its been kind of interesting as you start to see a little more action i think as you think about that business there are kind of really three drivers of success and thats probably what now and thats probably whats moving some of the action i think it comes down to scale integrated distribution if you have it and obviously performance and so if you look at we are a trillion of aum so we have meaningful scale our performance has actually been pretty darn good one of the things i cited in my opening remarks is that our largest funds where there are indices for them to follow and they make up about of our revenues are performing in the top one or first or second quartile and theyve been there over the last three years so i think were well positioned and its reflective weve got some pretty interesting assets underneath there the liabilitydriven investment its been growing and its a business that we think we can its primarily in the uk and europe its something i think we can import into the us weve got one of the worlds largest credit managers we just put a new ceo in place there this is primarily a european credit manager and i think theres significant opportunity for it to grow probably underperformed in the past couple of years its done fine but i think it missed opportunities to grow faster and if you think about our distribution were pretty interesting too because we have a wealth manager its open architected but it delivers some of our manufacturing capabilities and pershing is also a very powerful platform again open architected but its a platform where theres real estate for some of our product and probably more potential there so weve got a number of the components so were watching very carefully whats going on in the industry and if something made sense on our platform then we have to give it hard consideration the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then just a second question i mean last earnings call you talked about the potential cost saves opportunity from how you rethink workforce or workplace in the future indiscernible workfromhome in the pandemic how far along are you rethinking the workforce or workplace of the future and when you could actually see some cost saves come through from that thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah so as we think about it its going to impact real estate its going to impact things like disaster recovery sites because weve created a new amazing disaster recovery capability here it will certainly impact longer term what we think business development travel entertainment those type of costs so theres a number of areas throughout the organization weve done were starting to do a pretty deep analysis on who needs to be in the office all the time who doesnt need to be in the office any of the time and who should be in the office some of the time and my view is there continues to be a compelling argument for aggregating at least innovation it leads to building really the performance culture that you want to inculcate into the company difficult not to do it without some ph in present meetings i do think travel and seeing clients is still critical i think it will change a little bit and the use of some of the technology now will be much more frequent weve all gotten pretty astute at it as well even me and so i think that will all change so were kind of laying out where we could go and what the implication to our real estate is but thats going to ph but for that to factor into the pl will take some time and ultimately as much as we might think it should go one way or the other the markets also going to dictate a bit too because the we have a lot of technologists and if the market starts to lean to more work from home well adjust to that brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good thanks operator we will take our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning todd good morning emily emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc todd you mentioned obviously the binding constraint for your capital is the leverage ratio and when you look at your balance sheet i think you said ph its rated today its up about from a year ago can you share with us where do you think it should be under normal conditions and how long did it take to get there and the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 what would we need to see in the macro environment for you guys to actually reach a more normalized size of the balance sheet thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i think the balance sheet probably will grow traditionally with the growth in the underlying businesses which if you think about the auc and theres a relationship to that if you think about whats going on with pershing payables theres a relationship to that the treasury services business for example gerard we took a we went on a campaign we said we probably were too shy in taking on deposits and there was an opportunity were a great counterparty and our clients wanted us to grow our deposits there so i feel some of that was core growth underneath it its hard for me to really estimate exactly what is excess versus what would have been the traditional growth over that period and what would have grown based on our own internal efforts but i would expect there certainly is some excess in it and i would expect if there is a change in interest rates and we dont see that in the near term that would contract a bit obviously ph make it a lot more profitable but contracted a bit gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then coming back to something you said earlier in the call about organic growth if you look if you turn back the clock and look at your organic growth over the last three and maybe five years how are you framing out between existing customers giving you more business versus new customers owning new business that drives that organic growth thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah so if we first of all existing customers are great customers because they dont have the implementation costs and everything else about it is less so if a new fund if a client opens up a new fund and theyve got multiple custodians and were the ones winning the new funds thats organic growth and its very important to our organic growth and it demonstrates the quality of our services and the capabilities that weve got and thats where were seeing meaningful improvement so we would include that as well as newnew customers theyre only in the asset management space there are only so many new new customers to be had gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks gerard operator and we will take our last question from jim mitchell with seaport global the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2020 james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe just a big picture question on expenses todd it seems like the biggest challenge and opportunity both is just sort of standardizing and automating the client interface just how do you think about that opportunity set where are you and can that be sort of a longerterm tailwind thats material for expenses thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp emily do you want to take it emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure ultimately we many of our investments are all about improving the customer experience and making it much more seamless thats part and parcel of the open architecture that weve been talking about and its all about data integration and thats going to take a while thats in journey but and every client looks and feels slightly different so were kind of solving for many different outcomes but ultimately thats part of the open architecture strategy in that we want to offer bestinbreed and as much flexibility and optionality to our clients as we can thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp and the other thing that i would add is that when we look at our technology theres still a lot of legacy technology debt and one of the commitments and so the when you look at where were actually being forced to invest its in a lot of older systems and we could run those systems much more efficiently of course theyre effective they run theyre industrial like a lot of banks and just about all banks have the same issues as we cloudenable and make our underlying applications more and more efficient there will be opportunity there will be longterm opportunity to get rid of a lot of that legacy technology debt so this is so we dont see this as a one or twoyear effort i think it is just its just making the commitment to constantly reinvest to actually get it done because it does take investment to make that transition and so were trying to incorporate that into our investment activities so that we get to renew that stack so its a combination of both whats going on in the operations how efficiently we can be operating our corporate functions as well as how efficiently we can operate our technology james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay great thanks for the color thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks jim so i believe operator that was our last question operator yes and i would like to turn the conference back to
