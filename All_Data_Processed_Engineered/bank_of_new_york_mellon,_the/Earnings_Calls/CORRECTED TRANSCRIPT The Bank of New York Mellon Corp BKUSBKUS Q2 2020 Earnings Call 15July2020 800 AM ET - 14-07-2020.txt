share a few thoughts and how our business has been performing as weve adapted to a new normal during the second quarter volumes and volatility normalized somewhat across our businesses from the extreme first quarter disruption and conversations with clients have shifted from dealing with a crisis to how we can help support their business in this new environment but much uncertainty remains over the timing and shape of the global economic recovery in addition the low interest rate policy is a significant headwind for us that is unlikely to change in the near term operationally we continue to navigate the repercussions of the pandemic around of our employees continue to work remotely doing a phenomenal job delivering excellent service to our clients our operating platforms and infrastructures are supporting the current market working model well with record volumes in certain areas all which has put us in a good position as we discuss new business opportunities with our clients turning to our second quarter financial results we reported solid pretax income of billion and earnings per share of as a reminder we did not buy back shares in the second quarter in line with other big banks the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 we accreted capital and ended the quarter with a common equity tier ratio of up around basis points from the last quarter our average balance sheet increased yearoveryear to billion mainly driven by strong deposit inflows and associated growth and the securities portfolio revenue was up despite the impact of lower interest rates and related money market fee waivers all of our investment service businesses showed resilient performance asset servicing in particular is showing nice pockets of growth and our focus on service quality is paying off the challenges that asset managers are dealing with are driving more of them to outsource and our unique capabilities and fund accounting and transfer agencies as well as investments weve made in building out our digital and data capabilities positions as well last month more than attendees representing over client firms and consulting

market share within products services target clients segments and markets much of this is the outcome of consistently investing in technology and talent theres been an acceleration this year and the adoption of digital solutions by our clients who continue to review opportunities to automate the progress were making and digitizing our business positions us well on this front and were increasing our investment spend on technology driven automation initiatives in in march through june alone we migrated over clients to digital solutions and are accelerating our plans to do the same across all of our asset servicing clients we are now accepting digital signatures on many tax related forms to support remote processing digitizing these processes will help thousands of clients and reduce the millions of physical documents we deal with each year we also developed a new apienabled fx solution jointly with deutsche bank that can dramatically improve conformation times for restricted emerging market currency trades to provide front office users with faster execution and enhanced workflow transparency so weve accelerated our progress on the digital front and there are dozens of other examples the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 im proud that weve been working with the regulators and the industry to bring our capabilities and supporting the markets since last quarter weve been administering the primary dealer credit facility which facilitates dealers inventory financing our corporate trust business has also been mandated as the term assetbacked securities loan facility administrator and then were also servicing talf funds and asset servicing additionally were playing an important role in the fed supportive liquidity in the municipal markets via the municipal liquidity facility this ones a demonstration of the power of our uniquely broad range of solutions were able to bring together the expertise from asset servicing corporate trust investment management and capital markets to create a complex solution to support the facility looking ahead to the second half of were confident that our business model expense control and conservative credit risk profile will serve us well our efforts with clients are yielding results with higher win ratios better revenue retention and a good pipeline in pershing an asset servicing in particular we are pleased with the momentum we are seeing across all of our businesses the low interest rate environment will present a significant challenge both through net interest revenue and money market fee waivers in pershing and investment management and to a lesser extent other investment services businesses but at the same time we will benefit from increases in transaction volumes fx volatility stronger market levels and activity in our clearance and collateral management business the recent dfast and ccar results demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business model we had the lowest peak to trough reduction in cet1 capital under the feds model relative to other usbased gsibs at just basis points now thats well below the minimum scb requirement looking ahead at our capital returns we expect to maintain our quarterly common stock dividend at and we will not buy back shares during the third quarter we have a very strong capital position and low risk model that should allow us to reform well under a wide range of scenarios we will commence buybacks as soon as possible depending on the economic and regulatory environment our outlook for the business and outcome of the resubmitted capital plans based on new scenarios we expect to receive later this year in the second quarter we opportunistically issued billion in preferred stock and we think this gives us opportunity to restack our capital down the road longer term our growth is not dependent on increasing risk weighted assets which gives us the ability to return at least of capital to shareholders and were confident in our ability to continue returning attractive levels of capital and while the outlook for the economy remains uncertain for the foreseeable future i know that we will continue to navigate this environment well by deepening our client engagement as demand for our service grows benefiting from improving quality and improving efficiency of our operations

management since and has spearheaded newtons business momentum and client centric culture under mitchells leadership weve made great progress in building a diversified investment management business

very real racial and societal issues in our communities our board and our executive committee are passionate about using our voices and being positive change agents as a company we take great pride and all of our differences and our diversity of experiences and perspectives leads to better business outcome that starts with the diversity of our board which is africanamerican minorities and female

strengthening our commitment to attract develop and retain a diverse workforce were holding more open forums that foster meaningful dialogue and that we hope will bring us closer together during these challenging times were learning from each other building empathy and strengthening inclusive leadership skills that will serve us well and continuing to drive a high performance culture were expanding

that for the sixth consecutive year weve been named to the dow jones sustainable world index sic dow jones sustainability world index were going to continue to challenge ourselves to do more in the long run we firmly believe that doing whats right for the community our employees and our clients is in the best interest of our shareholders with that ill turn it over to mike michael santomassimo chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thanks todd and good morning everyone let me run through the details of our results for the quarter and all comparisons will be on a yearoveryear basis unless i specify otherwise beginning on page of the financial highlights document in the second quarter of we reported earnings of million down while earnings per share was flat at the total revenue was billion up even as we felt the impact of lower interest rates through money markets fee waivers and our net interest income fee revenue increased primarily reflecting higher fee in pershing and asset servicing partially offset by money market fee waivers lower investment management fees and the unfavorable impact of a stronger us dollar fee waivers negatively impacted growth by approximately the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 net interest revenue declined yearoveryear to million and was down versus the prior quarter our provision for credit losses was million in the quarter and this was primarily driven by ratings downgrades particularly across a commercial real estate book and the continuation of a challenging macroeconomic outlook we had no actual chargeoffs during the quarter expenses were up approximately as we continue to balance ongoing expense discipline with our technology investments and we still expect full year expenses to be flat to last year we had a solid return on tangible equity of and maintained pretax margin of over now moving to capital and liquidity on page our capital and liquidity ratios remain strong and well above internal targets and regulatory minimums in terms of shareholder capital returns in the second quarter we suspended share repurchases along with other financial services forum member banks and will do so again in the third quarter in line with federal reserve requirements we continue to pay our quarterly cash dividend which totaled million in the second quarter and believe we have ample capacity to continue to pay the dividend on a variety of economic scenarios common equity tier capital totaled billion at june and our cet1 ratio was under the advanced approach and under the standardized approach under the new stress capital buffer rules that will become effective october we will need to maintain a cet1 ratio of including a stress capital buffer which is the minimum and a gsib surcharge now as we think about our binding capital ratio constraint going forward tier leverage can be more binding than cet1 due to the buffers we need to hold for potential growth in deposits which are more volatile than rwa during times of market volatility very much like what weve seen over the last two quarters as always we will continue to optimize our capital ratios across all the constraints our average lcr in the second quarter was now turning to page my comments on the interest revenue will highlight the sequential changes net interest revenue was million down while clientdriven deposit growth drove the increase in our average balance sheet this benefit was more than offset by full quarter impact of lower interest rates hedging activity added modestly to the linked quarter comparison as you can see on the bar chart and is primarily offset in foreign exchange and other trading fees average deposit balances were up billion versus the first quarter averages and are up billion or versus last year this growth is across all of our businesses some increasing from the monetary reserves in the system ph clients plan to cash and some from internal deposit initiatives that are linked to operational and fee generating activities as weve mentioned in the past we generate and manage significant amount of cash across our franchise this is a key client differentiator for us particularly in volatile markets we provide cash management services that have led to good growth in deposits in our balance sheet growth in money market funds in our open architecture money market investment platform and through dreyfus cash products weve passed along the fed rate cuts as interest bearing deposit rates declined to minus basis points in the second quarter this was the result of the combination of very low rates paid in the us plus negative rates on eurodenominated deposits as a reminder approximately of our deposits are nonus dollar on average the securities portfolio increased approximately billion versus the first quarter and around billion in the last year as we have deployed the growing deposit base the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 the net interest margin of basis points was down basis points versus the first quarter driven by the increase in deposits and lower yielding low risk interestearning assets we continue to focus on optimizing net interest revenue rather than just net interest margin now moving to page which provides some color on our asset mix our average interestearning assets increased to billion approximately of these assets are held in cash or reverse repos while are in our securities portfolio and in our loan portfolio in addition to the funded loan shown on the page we also have unfunded committed lines the details of which can be found in the 10q during the quarter we saw about billion of the billion of borrowings drawn down from revolving credit facilities repaid and were closely monitoring the portfolio particularly the commercial real estate exposure and other sectors more acutely impacted by the current environment the impacted credits including commercial real estate are performing well but may see additional downgrades depending on the shape and speed of the recovery turning to the securities portfolio we have a high quality liquid portfolio much of it is in the us government agency securities us treasuries and sovereign debt the portfolio increased as we deployed more cash into securities including the commercial paper and cds we purchased from our affiliated and thirdparty money market funds the billion of clos are highly rated with aaa or aa of the nonagency cmbs are aaa and have solid subordination the rest of the ratings breakdown can be found in the supplement page provides an overview on expenses on a consolidated basis expenses of billion were up around driven by higher technology expenses and pension costs offset by lower business development expenses mainly travel and marketing and the favorable impact of a stronger us dollar distribution expenses were only slightly impacted by money market fee waivers and investment management as the bulk of the impact from money market fee waivers was in pershing and from thirdparty funds turning to page total investment services revenue was up assets under custody andor administration increased yearoveryear to trillion primarily reflecting higher market values partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger us dollar foreign exchange and other trading revenue in the segment increased yearoveryear driven primarily by higher volatility as well as organic client growth in foreign exchange even as industry volumes were down slightly within asset servicing revenue was up to billion primarily reflecting higher fx higher client volumes across securities lending liquidity services and transaction volumes as well as a onetime fee securities lending revenues were higher on improved spread and a strong demand for us government bonds in pershing revenue was up to million despite the impact of money market fee waivers reflecting much higher money market fund balances which were up and higher transaction volumes but down from the exceptional volumes we experienced in the first quarter the net impact of money market fee waivers partially offset by higher money market fund balances negatively impacted pershings revenue growth by issuer services revenue decreased to million reflecting declines in both corporate trust and depositary receipts revenue the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 depositary receipts revenue was primarily impacted by lower corporate action volumes while in corporate trust new business and deposit growth was offset by lower volumes of new products and interest rates treasury services revenue was up to million driven by higher liquidity balances and related fees offset by lower payment volumes correlated to lower economic activity deposit balances increased yearonyear by as investments in new capabilities and increased focus on deposit gathering were critical to retaining most of the growth from earlier in the year clearance and collateral management revenue was up to million from higher clearance volumes mostly from nonus clients as well as fees and deposit balances average triparty collateral management balances were up in the us and outside the us page summarizes the key drivers that affected the yearoveryear revenue comparisons for each of our investment services businesses now turning to investment and wealth management on page total investment in wealth management revenue was down investment management revenue was roughly flat to million reflecting the unfavorable change in the mix of assets under management since the second quarter of and the impact of money market fee waivers partially offset by equity investment gains net of hedges including seed capital please note the gains from seed capital include results from unconsolidated and consolidated investment management funds both of which can be lumpy in any given quarter depending on market conditions details can be found in the supplement on the consolidated income statement the gains are either in investment and other income or income from consolidated investment management funds while the negative impact from their hedging were approximately million as recorded in other trading we had inflows of billion in the quarter reflecting continued cash inflows as well as longterm flows into index funds and fixed income overall assets under management of just under trillion are up yearoveryear primarily due to higher markets and cash inflows wealth management revenue was down yearoveryear to million primarily reflecting lower net interest revenue due to lower interest rates and client migration to lower fee fixed income and cash products now a few comments about the third quarter first i would caution you as we did last quarter that the environment remains fluid and variables are changing quickly looking ahead at net interest revenue we will have a full quarter of lower rates in the third quarter especially shortterm libor rates which declined throughout the second quarter we have also seen some pickup in prepayment speeds and our mortgagebacked securities portfolio given current and expected refinancing volumes significant excess liquidity in the system continues to drive elevated deposit levels versus but the exit rate from  is just a little lower than the average for the quarter and as a result we currently expect net interest revenue to decline to sequentially however based on current market conditions we would expect net interest revenue to begin to stabilize in the third quarter now in money market fee waivers the pretax impact in the second quarter was million net of distribution expense with the biggest impact in pershing its important to note that approximately million of this impact has been offset by a substantial increase in money market fund balances resulting in a net impact of approximately million in the second quarter we expect the impact from fee waivers to increase in the third the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 quarter by about million to million net of lower distribution expenses this additional impact in the third quarter would also be reduced if money market fund balances continue to grow a little over half of that impact will be in pershing with the rest of the investment management and asset servicing we currently expect that we will incur an incremental million in the fourth quarter and will be at a full run rate impact from fee waivers of about million to million offset by the incremental money market fund balance growth that weve seen in the second quarter for net impact of about million to million per quarter by year end this quarterly impact could be reduced if money market fund balances continue to grow further current equity market level should be modest positive if they hold we saw transactional activity in fx continue to normalize over the course of the second quarter and assuming this continues will be modest headwind sequentially although we expect the related fees will be higher than in the prior year if we see some volatility in the equity markets transactional activity could pick up on expenses we will expect them to be flat versus excluding notable items this includes the basis point full yearoveryear impact from higher pension expense credit costs will be highly dependent upon individual credits the future path of the health crisis and how the economics forecast changed by the time we get to the end of the third quarter in terms of our effective tax rate while a little lower this quarter we expect it to be approximately for the full year versus prior guidance of to with that operator can we please open the lines up for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instruction our first question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning thanks for the time this morning a couple of questions one todd you mentioned the virtual presentation that you gave or the virtual conference that you gave and i wanted to understand how important that is for generating new client activity and if you think that that virtual kind of format and forum can deliver the same kind of client activity growth that youve seen in prior years ph with face to face thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yes first of all in terms of engaging with our clients its been pretty effective i think initially i think there was a little reticence as we moved into the crisis but now we basically see this as our bau and so both clients and i think ourselves have gotten quite a bit better at managing the technology to actually communicate and connect and share what were doing so this particular conference where we had about clients and vendors come into it was we also posted on our website a whole series of detailed analysis of some of the new capabilities that are out there and available to them and the hits against that have been very high so i think its been pretty effective weve actually seen the the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 pipeline grow weve also seen retention high and actually sales were up in the first half of the year over where we were last year betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right thats helpful thanks and then mike on the guidance can we just dig in a little bit on the nii ph contra that you gave i think you said nii down to maybe just give us some color on the drivers there and is it and why do you see it ameliorating as you go into and and if you could give us a sense of the differences in the drivers between deposit growth and yield compression that would be helpful michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yes sure betsy so i think when you look at the third quarter its really all about rates coming down and getting the full impact of that for the full quarter thats really the primary driver and theres a series of actions that i think you can see that were taking in the results both in increasing the securities portfolio and optimizing sort of how were investing there and so i think as you sort of look out past the third quarter and you look at all the actions were taking plus you look at where the forward curves are that gives us some confidence that it begins to stabilize in the third quarter as you look forward and obviously the forward view on deposits will sort of have some impact on that but the marginal dollar gets a little less impactful with rates where they are so betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much maybe just a quick followup on the rate impact we used to think an anchor might be the nim low but i guess i appreciate the long end has come down more than it was then you mentioned focusing on nii over net interest margins so i guess there could be more down there so my quickie is deposits sticking around despite the interest bearing deposit rate being minus basis points im curious to hear any color on client conversations there and if thats now at its resting point or is there more room on the negative side as clients park and have no other alternatives thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp mike why dont i start that one and then you can probably give a little bit of color i think that were again the mix of deposits makes a big impact glenn on that rate so there are a fair amount of foreign deposits and european deposits that are actually carrying a negative rate and we pass that through the clients the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 in the us with the ioer around basis points that seems to be anchoring somewhat around that rate unless we see changes going on in the money markets which we havent seen a whole lot of noise yet so i think most of the downside passthrough has already been made i dont know mike if you have anything to add to that michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah no i think thats right i mean i think the negative is really driven by euros as todd said glenn and when you look at the us dollar deposits its a lowsingledigit sort of interest rate paid now on the book and so theres not a lot of room to continue to bring that down glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay i appreciate that one qualifier on the provision obviously were writing to a worse economic backdrop but you also mentioned the impact that downgrades have so my question is if we move forward and the economic scenarios dont change in other words we feel like were kind of where were at will further downgrades keep continue to be the gift that keeps giving on the provision were just trying to dimensionalize how much to bake in if the economic scenario doesnt change thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay mike do you want to take that michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah sure todd so glenn i think its a tough question to ask right and so if things dont get worse from what is being projected now in the scenarios then you would expect that the issuer downgrades should be somewhat limited from here but there will be idiosyncratic issues that may change some of that so i think obviously these downgrades and the scenarios are somewhat interrelated as we sort of look at both of them glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay i appreciate that thank you guys operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning hey mike just a followup on the fee waiver commentary just want to make sure that were talking about it the right way in terms of the total number versus the gross so are you saying that youd expect that growth to continue when you gave us the two sets of numbers so just the cadence going forward i guess maybe if you can just help us understand the net trajectory from here would be the better way i think to help us think through that michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 yeah no sure i know and i can appreciate its probably a little complicated but so as you sort of look at the net impact of million to million by the time we get to yearend underpinning that assumes that balances holds to about where they are so it does not assume that there is additional growth there and so i think if we do continue to see growth in the balances we will see that get offset a bit as we look towards the end of the year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay so right that net number the million to million minus million from growth that assumes the balances are flat from here okay geographically a couple of quick things could you just help us understand the size of the onetime gain in asset servicing and then just can you talk through just the income statement line asset servicing just whats happening underneath the surface there in terms of core servicing collateral and brokerdealer services thank mike michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah sure thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp mike do you want to that michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah so the onetime fee ken is actually in other income its not in the asset servicing fee line its not something we have disclosed exactly what it is its not super meaningful but it does show up in the other income line so it doesnt impact your fee your asset servicing fees at all as you sort of look at whats underneath asset servicing and the fee line i think youre seeing growth in both the clearance and collateral management business and the asset servicing business as sort of todd pointed out the different drivers there that are sort of impacting that line ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian bedell with deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning folks can you just one more on the fee waivers can we track the level of money market fund balances i appreciate obviously theres the dreyfus funds in the asset management business but its also a number of thirdparty funds on the pershing platform so i dont know if youve got that disclosed for the level of those balances and if its something that we can track given the pershing side i dont think we can see the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp mike do you want to take that one michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah sure and brian theres actually a couple of drivers underneath the fund balances one were obviously seeing is in pershing and thats not something that we disclose and two were also seeing it growth in asset servicing as well where we sweep money into money market funds through our open architecture platforms there indiscernible these numbers are not something that we disclose so weve seen growth across the platform weve seen growth really in all channels brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great so you could have an organic growth dynamic in this thats different than the money market fund industry at large that could keep that the fee waivers closer or even less than million to million is that a feasible conclusion potentially michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah potentially brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just maybe just to talk on the new business and asset servicing todd you mentioned a lot of initiatives partly from the tech investments on the database and also the distribution analytics system anyway to frame what type of or what level of new business you think youre getting from these initiatives in say in the next or what you expect in the next say six months or so and any kind of revenue impact or growth impact to asset servicing you think as a result of these initiatives thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i think first of all some of these are very new and some of the applications that weve just put out there weve just gone live in the past month or so brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so our estimate is that we could see some meaningful growth driven by the data and the digital and data analytics that were offering that we talked about so its just now gathering momentum there is a lot of discussions and but its early weve got a couple of beta clients on it that we described and they actually participated in the engage conference both charles schwab and nuveen but i think underlying that if you look at our pipeline if the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 you look at the growth rate that we demonstrated we are seeing a little bit of organic growth for the first time in a while brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great ill get back in the queue for another question thanks operator our next question comes from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks good morning everybody so a couple of quick followups i guess first one is around nir so you guys talked about optimizing nir off of sort of trough levels which makes sense can you walk us through sort of the opportunities that you see to invest some of the excess cash that kind of compiled in the balance sheet ph in the securities portfolio so anything specifically you can point to in terms of how much could ultimately be moved to securities over time and sort of the yields you guys expect to earn on that and then anything you guys could do on the liability side as well so deposit costs will be kind of what they are with the market but curious if theres an opportunity to further restack longterm debt ph want to make sure you guys do a little bit of that in the quarter thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp mike michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure yeah ill try to get all of those pieces alex or remind me if i dont so as you sort of maybe ill start with the last one first so if you look at the liability side were always looking for ways to sort of optimize as you said deposit costs are probably near where theyre going to bottom in the us but on the margin there may be a little bit here and there with particular clients on the longterm debt side we are looking at optimizing that more i think youll see us kind of bring that down maybe just a little bit as we sort of look forward over the next quarter but i think obviously we need to keep enough longterm debt to meet a bunch of different constraints that weve got but i do think theres a little bit of opportunity to optimize that as we look forward on the securities side you can see the increases over sequentially and yearonyear are pretty significant in terms of what weve been able to redeploy the majority of that has gone into sort of highly liquid assets sort of hqla as sort of the term goes right and i think youll see us continue to put more into hqla assets as well as look for opportunities where we can get the right risk profile and the right return for some less liquid assets as we sort of look forward and as we sort of get more experience with the deposit base and weve been talking about this now for a couple of quarters as we sort of see the behavior of the deposits come on to the balance sheet each month every days you get a better sense of what the operational nature and the duration of those deposits are going to look like and so you can sort of keep you can keep optimizing how much youre going to deploy each month the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 and each quarter as you look forward and so were doing that so we still think theres some opportunity to continue to deploy more alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc okay thats helpful and my second question is around the expense outlook i think early in the quarter you guys spoke at a conference and the outlook for expenses for i believe was flat to down and it sounds like its flat now so whats changed or could expenses still decline this year and maybe just a quick reminder in terms of how much incremental tech spend is running through pl in which part of that i guess is supposed to phase out into thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay mike why dont i start with this and maybe you can add some additional color i think weve guided for a while that will be flat or around flat for the rest of the year and im confident that well do that at least at or better and as we look out to next year i think weve got significant opportunities around our efficiency programs especially in operations and the increased spend that weve made over the past couple of years in tech will begin to abate as the investments in infrastructure and resiliency will be largely behind us so we think weve got more that we can do here looking out over the next year or two mike why dont you give a little more color around the tech spend michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah look i think as weve talked about that in the last couple of years as todd said weve been making those investments in the operating platform as well as other capabilities like you talked about with data and analytics and other new products across the different businesses and i think while the growth rate has been slowing over the last year i think as todd said weve got much more flexibility to sort of look at that as we sort of exit the year the only other thing id add is were seeing the benefit of the efficiencies come through were spending less in operations this year than we did last year were going to spend less next year than we did this year and we feel very confident that weve got line of sight to continue to execute on the efficiency agenda as todd mentioned alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp ph and i think in alex ill add to that i think we probably made the biggest spend that weve made and in fact in increasing efficiencies across operating efficiencies across the company alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great that makes sense thanks again the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions well first actually id like to just start with a request the fee waiver dynamic is seems like theres a lot of moving parts just something to consider for coming quarters maybe a little enhanced disclosure or maybe a memo disclosure so we could try to consider how to model some of these components given that theres balance movement and all this other stuff i know its probably tricky but it might help but taking a step back widening back the lens a little were clearly in a rate environment thats a lot more challenging for your business model the idea that monetary policy low rates as a monetary policy tool this certainly seems to be now the new normal and its not a temporary thing that were all dealing with here are you starting to think about different ways in which you can engage with your customer base different ways in which you can structure your relationships and the deposit dynamics so you can have more confidence in the duration of the deposits how are you making adjustments or how are you thinking about making adjustments to sort of the fundamental ways in which you engage with your customers so you can ensure that you can monetize the components of all these relationships in the most effective way given low rates are going to be around for probably some time thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so mike why dont i take that and then i think you can add some color to it so first of all brennan the comments around the fee waivers well take that to heart i want to make sure somethings clear because there might be a little confusion here what weve indicated is that we think that the full impact of interest rates to our net interest income will begin to stabilize in the third quarter which is basically saying that were coming out with approximately that run rate as we go forward and thats taking into consideration what we know today with the shape of the yield curve so we see some stability here as we reset around the very low interest rate environment as we fully reset around it that same impact is going to be fully reset through fee waivers by the end of the year and if you look at the disclosures that mike had given you its very specific to what that is we dont know what the actual balances are going to be so if the balances grow then that impact can be quite a bit less because therell be additional income related to money market balances so i wanted to make that clear in terms of how were working with our clients and pricing whether its around whether its directly around deposit activity or our treasury services theyre certainly taking the interest rate environment into consideration and anytime we put together more of our platform business like an asset servicing we take that into the pricing discussion taking whatever market conditions would be likely implication to our margins and that type of activity so were doing that on a daytoday basis mike you have anything to add to that michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp no i think thats right and were continuing to have a pretty close dialogue with a lot of the clients that have large or mediumsized sort of balances with us and i think in part as you look at a business like treasury services its the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 ensuring that we get our fair share of the payments business and the fee revenue that comes along with having these balances and so i think its not only about optimizing sort of their reinvestment side of the balance sheet its also about making sure that were monetizing the fee relationship with these clients as well and thats as much a focus for us and our clients and sales folks as is the balance sheet side of it brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yeah no i appreciate that and thats all very very fair when we think about capital you flagged the strong showing of bank of new york through the dfast process can you talk about like clearly you have a low risk model it was clearly showcased during the dfast but because youre categorized as a gsib you are now continue youre constrained in the ability to return capital and so even though youre pretty far above a lot of your requirements you cannot manage the capital base as much as you will how is the engagement with the regulators as far as trying to point that out is there going to be a staggered start based upon risk inherent risk in the business model where the gsibs that are lower risk should be able to start returning capital sooner or is this going to be one of these things that all the g sibs are lumped together and therefore firms that have really really minimal credit risk profiles like bk end up at the same starting line as some of the big investment banks and commercial banks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah so mike ill start with this one too so i mean as you know the stress test is idiosyncratic test for us and so as we go through it we have performed quite well we have submitted our capital action plans and we have indicated that we will look and we performed quite well i know theres going to be a reevaluation using some new scenarios that indiscernible sometime at the end of the third or particularly fourth quarter and so well go through that process that being said we expect to perform quite well just given the resiliency as you pointed out of our balance sheet and our business model one of those things that comes out of the new stressed capital buffer the scb model is that as you get a little more flexibility around your buybacks you dont have to youre not limited on a quarterly basis you just need to stay within your scb so there could be a timing difference based on whatever regulatory considerations or the environment might look like but ultimately as we accrete capital that just puts us in a stronger position to buy it back when the opportunity arises so i like the way we are accreting capital and i think that puts us in a position to buyback a considerable amount of stock as soon as possible operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mike carrier with bank of america please go ahead michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc good morning and thanks for taking the questions so first i just want to try to understand the indiscernible covid impact and could normalize ahead so any color on how much the deposit balance growth has been driven by some of the policy responses could normalize and then you guys noted if new business wins and the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 thats an area that would have expected to be a bit more challenging just in this environment and so have you seen much impact and do you see like a pipeline forming potentially start to normalize as we get back thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so mike can you clarify the first part of that question i didnt quite catch it michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc yeah sure thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp your first part indiscernible michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc yeah sure the first part was just on the growth in deposit balances i know its hard to determine it exactly would drive some of those balances but some firms have tried to quantify whats been kind of impacted by the coronavirus and some of the policy responses versus whats more sort of core business operations that is the first part and then the second part was just on the new business wins would have expected that to be a little bit more challenging environment but it seems like you continue to have some decent wins there so just wanted to try to gauge how has that been impacted by this environment in terms of the pipeline thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay mike do you want to take the deposit component of the question michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah sure mike so as you sort of look at whats happened since the middle of march what you saw was this massive increase and if you recall what our spot balance was at the end of the first quarter it was billion in terms of deposits and so that huge volatile piece of the deposit balance has come off already and as you can see where we were for the quarter in the in terms of the average and so youve already seen that sort of massive spike retreat and so while its in hindsight youll have a better view in terms of whats driven the increase from the february balances of around million to where we are today but i think its hard to ignore that the environment thats been caused the economic environment thats been caused by the pandemic is a big driver of the pace at which those deposits have increased from the february levels but as we look forward while were in this environment for sure it feels like were in this environment for longer its hard to see given all of the response the policy monetary policy response from the fed and others that the balances would retreat much more from where they are the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp and i can take the second component of your question mike which was around the new business wins i mean clients are still making servicer decisions and relative to last year weve probably seen weve been winning and retaining more deals and higher value deals which is important i think weve learned how to work from home weve ramped up our focus on client management over that time and were actually seeing an increase in activity with reviews and presentations being done virtually and weve got some nice wins around eps around our midoffice space and we continue to implement at a rapid pace against the midoffice weve got the talf servicing related wins as well so the pipeline remains strong i think were getting used to this as being the current normal michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc got it okay and then mike just a quick cleanup there were just a few ph positive items in any quarter i think some like investment gains in funds and then you mentioned that other investment in income ph net asset servicing fee away from that im assuming that most of it was just market related just given what we saw in the quarter but were there any other factors in todays line items im assuming we just expect that to normalize lower ahead but if any color are there any other nuances there michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp no i think its pretty straightforward on those investment and other income you can kind of see the breakdown of that in supplement and the thing that will be in the other income line that will be volatile obviously you see capital and how the market sort of moves within the quarter and then the other trading line youll have some impact there as well from the same moves michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi im just trying to reconcile a couple of thoughts todd you had some really positive comments with your introductory remarks and maybe you can elaborate some on your work with the government and what kind of fees you get from that and how sustainable those fees are but then mike you certainly commented about the impact of lower interest rates and youre certainly not sugarcoating that so thats try and connect those two different thoughts and the other two different thoughts i have is you guys are certainly service more fixed income assets than your peers so you should be benefiting from that quite a bit and im not sure if thats showing up as much as you might expect with the increased fixed income activity thank you the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah mike thanks so in terms of there are a number of government programs that were participating are that we are supporting or administering some of them are showing some growth for example the pdcf is where we use our triparty repo system so its reflected in the amount of triparty repo activity which we did see go up in the first quarter and sustain itself to a certain extent although its starting to come off a little bit in the second and third quarter but we are seeing good activity on the global side of the triparty book and its really going to its going to be a matter of how much those programs are taken up before we see any revenue i think the more important is the other component of our revenue growth across our investment services business in terms of the fixed income activity where youre seeing in clearing and collateral management you are seeing increased clearing volumes on our clearing platform and we are benefiting to a certain extent from that and i think that was reflected if you looked at the investment services uptick and the highlights you could see that and i think weve been very directive where we are with the interest rates but i think the important thing to know is that we are we see ourselves reaching a bottom here in a very short period of time mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so when you add it all together do you think you said flat expenses for the year revenues any guidance for the year for that relative to those expenses thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp well i think that the headwinds for revenues weve disclosed to you and thats all interest rate related mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and so do you think you can get flat operating leverage this year or positive or negative are you just dont want to make a call on that thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp right now i wouldnt make a call on that just given the uncertainty around some of those elements mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay lastly you are investing in technology so that you said thats elevated this year and that should fall off some next year so thats youre not going to sacrifice those investments for the longterm thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thats correct thats correct mike i mean we in fact the investments we made in operating efficiencies that well see the benefit over the next couple of years is the highest weve ever made will be the highest weve ever made in the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it all right thanks a lot operator thank you operator instructions well next go to rob wildhack with autonomous research please go ahead robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp good morning guys there have been some headlines that some of your peers are rolling out what seems to be a similar integration and partnership you struck with aladdin and blackrock can you talk about what youre seeing on that front and maybe highlight what you think differentiates your integration there versus some of the other options thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp mike do you want to do that one or you want me to take it why dont you take it mike michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah sure hey rob look i think as you would expect blackrock works with a whole series of providers and those providers would use aladdin in some form or fashion and i think thats to be expected and was happening already i think the good news is were the only provider that has all our capabilities embedded inside of aladdin and so the widgets or the capabilities of the functionality that weve built are actually accessible through aladdin and were the only ones that you can do that so i think weve got a really strong relationship with blackrock on the servicing side and the partnership side and we look forward to continuing to build new capabilities with them that continue to differentiate what our common clients can do versus others but we do think theres some differences there robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning todd good morning mike the question i have has to do with the credit quality clearly you guys are not a creditcentric bank like some of the universal banks can you give us some color on the provision that you put up what you build out your portfolio when is that provision allocated to that portfolio and is it just general allocations or were there some specific reserves that you put against specific loans the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp mike do you want to take it michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah gerard so i would say generally the build was related to commercial real estate portion of the portfolio thats certainly where the biggest piece of it was its not a general sort of allocation obviously its a very detailed sort of namebyname and then you apply all the modeling that goes around with it but as you sort of look at the build the biggest portion of it would be related to the commercial real estate portion gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then coming back to the deposit rates you ph saw about i guess or increase in your foreign office deposits and the average rate went from the first quarter ph you paid basis points i think or basis points down to negative basis points what interest rates should we be watching overseas toward the negative rates and you had the growth even though you went to negative rates ph are deposits essentially inelastic meaning is there a point where you would be concerned that people would move money out if the negative rates ph went too negative thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp mike do you want to take that indiscernible to basis points yeah michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah and gerard when you look at the disclosure there domestic versus foreign offices that doesnt necessarily denote currency denomination a good chunk of the deposits in the foreign offices are actually us dollar deposits and so i think you really sort of need to look at the rate in aggregate when you think about whats happened over the quarter i think when you look at the and so as you sort of look at that rate coming down the biggest driver of the rate coming down in the foreign offices is actually us paying lower amounts on us dollars not increased negative rates outside the us but obviously the biggest driver for us other than us dollar is going to be our euro deposits when you think about negative rates and thats something were focused on i think when you think about our deposits inelastic i think theres a portion of the deposits that are very much tied to the underlying operational activity and so i think that there is we have when we charge clients for negative rates there are spreads attached to those negative rates and we havent seen much movement as a result of the pricing and the spreads that weve applied to those deposits gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw please go ahead the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks just a real quick question first on that tax rate guide i mean you gave it for the full year this year but is that also a good number to use on a go forward basis the thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp mike michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp i would probably think to ph and just sort of look forward based on what we know today but i think for this year its definitely closer to brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then just a quick followup on the expenses i heard the ph tech expense guide this year but obviously theres a lot of kind of onetimers and unique nature going on given the current situation so is the right way to think about expenses as we look forward to and that there should be a natural downward progression to expenses just as these onetimers go away and then the rest of it ph as you think about expenses is really going to be driven by revenue growth in the next year so that there is some kind of downward bias on expenses to start with for thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp well yeah but i had indicated there are a couple of good things number one is i think the efficiencies that weve invested in will continue to register themselves next year and over the next couple of years and were not slowing down on that theres a lot more automation there are a lot of additional things that we can do to make ourselves more efficient and actually improve the client experience at the same time and on top of that we have been growing our tech expense quite a bit over the past three years a lot of that was infrastructure resiliency as well as some of the efficiency investments and some of the product capabilities we think a fair amount of the infrastructure component of that will be behind us which should give us a bit of a tailwind as we look out over the next couple of years operator thank you and next in queue we have a followup question from brian bedell with deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks so much for taking my followup mike just maybe just to dive in a little bit more on the balance sheet deposit levels i think at period end were up at million versus the million average so maybe just some commentary on whether you think that was the typical quarter end spike or do you think those levels are the period levels of deposits are sustainable as you see it right now in the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 and then just on the securities mix that you talked about moving more shortterm shifting the balance sheet composition towards securities as you get confidence in this durability of the deposits what type of level do you think that mix could go up to from the because i guess you could potentially get some nim expansion ph after this bottoms in if you do that michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure ill start with the first one brian i think the you cant read much into one days worth of deposit balances and so i would sort of put that in the bucket of a typical quarter end spot number and so sometimes that will be higher sometimes that will be lower and there was one deposit that sort of drove that up a little bit for a particular client so i think the guidance i gave around the current levels are slightly below where the average was is probably a good way to sort of think about where we are right now i think as you sort of think about how much we can deploy into the securities portfolio i think thats something thats dynamic ph based on sort of how we feel about the stability and the longevity of those deposits audio gap youll see us continue to optimize as we go into the quarter its not something well give you a specific percentage on because obviously there are other drivers of that but we do think theres continued opportunity there brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay fair enough and then just on the deposits and money market fund balances are you agnostic mostly between that client usage as that cash moves around between thirdparty money market balances and dreyfus of course as well versus the deposits on the balance sheet in those programs i guess the question there are you agnostic as to where that lands or are you are you trying to favor one area over the other in terms of revenue generation capabilities i guess on the fee versus the balance sheet side michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp do you want me to take that todd thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah mike go ahead michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp i think the answer is it depends brian i think when you think about shortterm balances that we know wont be around for very long i think we are relatively agnostic with ioer at basis points of where they go whether its in a money market fund or on the balance sheet i think well earn about the same i think as you sort of think about operational deposits we are over time well make more money with them being on the balance sheet brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thanks for taking my followup the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp ill be very specific with clients but thanks for the question brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay yeah okay thanks for taking the followup operator we also do have a followup question from alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey thanks for the followup guys sorry indiscernible but back to this money market fund dynamic real quick so mike i think on the last update you guys had said you expect the pretax impact on a quarterly basis from money market fee waivers to be about million to million and you talked about that being probably at the higher end of that range in the second quarter now you guys guide into million to million by the end of the year so i just want to make sure that these two numbers are kind of comparable and essentially were at least talking about million more in sort of incremental pretax input from fee waivers michael santomassimo a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah its a good question alex i think the when you look at the million to million at that point it was unclear what was going to happen with money fund balances and so i think the million to million was the gross impact and as we sort of look at the million to million thats the net impact of now is accounting for the fact that we think the balance growth that we saw is going to stick with us for a while so if you look at what i gave in my script i said by the fourth quarter the gross impact will be million to million which is equivalent to that million to million but it will be offset by the fact that we think the balances will stick around so thats how you get that size to million alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thats clear thanks very much operator thank you and it does appear we have no further questions in the queue at this time id like to turn the conference back over to mr todd gibbons for any additional or closing remarks thomas p gibbons chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay thank you everybody for your questions and obviously you can reach out to madga investor relations for any further followup have a good day operator thank you this
