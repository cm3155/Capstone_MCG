delivered solid financial performance while we continued to take important steps in the deliberate transformation of our company and were seeing early signs of progress that give us confidence as we work toward the opportunity ahead looking beyond bny mellon the first three months of the year provided a mostly constructive operating environment with global markets signaling expectations for continued growth equity and credit markets rallied even as rate cut expectations partially unwound and bond yields rose foreign exchange markets on the other hand saw a continuation of the relatively low volumes and muted volatility that weve now seen for the past several quarters and of course there are many tail risks including a variety of different markets scenarios the possibility of escalation in one of the ongoing geopolitical conflicts or an unexpected result in the many elections taking place worldwide this year as ive said many times before being resilient matters and this represents a commercial strength for our business we are constantly preparing and positioning for a wide range of potential scenarios to support our clients and deliver compelling outcomes for our shareholders now referring to page two of the financial highlights presentation bny mellon delivered double digit eps growth as well as pretax margin and rotce expansion on the back of positive operating leverage in the first quarter the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 we reported earnings per share of up yearoveryear and excluding notable items earnings per share of were up total revenue of billion was up yearoveryear that included growth in investment services fees led by strength in asset servicing issuer services and clearance and collateral management which more than offset revenue headwinds from muted volatility in fx markets and lower net interest income expenses of billion were up yearoveryear and up excluding notable items consistent with our goal to generate at least some operating leverage this year in the first quarter we did deliver positive operating leverage both on a reported basis and excluding notable items our reported pretax margin was or excluding notable items and we generated a return on tangible common equity our balance sheet remains strong with capital and liquidity ratios in line with our management targets and deposit balances were up both yearoveryear and sequentially yeartodate we returned close to of earnings to common shareholders through dividends and buybacks and our board of directors has authorized a new billion share repurchase program on our last earnings call in january we communicated mediumterm financial targets and presented our plan to improve bny mellons financial performance we frame this work for our people through three strategic pillars be more for our clients run our company better and power our culture throughout the first quarter weve made progress to be more for our clients including both product innovation and greater intensity around better delivering our platforms to the market so we can truly help clients achieve their ambitions as a global financial services company our unique portfolio of market leading and complementary businesses presents a tremendous additional value for our clients and shareholders as you know we are maturing our 1bny mellon initiative by implementing this mentality into the nutsandbolts processes across the company for example we recently announced that ashton thomas securities an independent broker dealer and registered investment advisor will use clearing and custody services from pershing and bny mellon precision direct indexing capabilities from investment management this is a great example of multiple lines of business working together to provide holistic solutions for clients as we continue to grow our client roster we also know that delivering more to our existing clients represents a significant opportunity as another example last month we expanded on a longstanding relationship with cifc an alternative credit specialist and existing client of ours in asset servicing and corporate trust to bring their us direct lending strategy onto our global distribution platform this also speaks to the incremental value that asset servicing can bring to our asset manager clients by allowing them to tap into bny mellons global distribution platform to extend the reach of their capabilities consistent with our previously communicated intention to grow the revenue contribution of our market and wealth services segment were starting to see our investments to accelerate revenue growth in this high margin segment begin to bear fruit the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 for example we continue to be encouraged by the level of interest from both new and existing clients in our wove wealth advisory platform we have several clients live on the platform today we closed a number of deals in the first quarter and the sales pipeline continues to be strong across market and wealth services we also continue to bring new solutions to the market for example treasury services successfully launched virtual account based solutions a set of cash management solutions to meet our clients demands for more flexibility and transparency into their payment flows next we are taking important steps to run our company better by simplifying processes powering our platforms and embracing new technologies over the past several months weve been working to realign several similar products and services across our lines of business the largest of these changes was moving institutional solutions from pershing to our clearance and collateral management business this is also part of making progress toward adopting a platforms operating model by uniting related capabilities we can do things in one place do them well and elevate overall execution to better serve our clients and drive growth last month we went live with the first step on the transition into our new model while it has taken and will continue to take a lot of hard work as we transform our operating model over time we are confident this new way of working will create better outcomes for our clients and it will also create more efficiency and enhanced risk management around of our people around the world are now working in our new operating model allowing them to feel more connected to what were doing and empowered to make change id like to thank our teams who are part of this exciting change for pushing us forward as we mark this important milestone we also see meaningful opportunity over the coming years from continued digitization and reengineering initiatives as well as from embracing new technologies to support this effort we are making deliberate investments enabling us to scale ai technologies across the organization through our enterprise ai hub last month nvidia announced that bny mellon became the first major bank to deploy a dgx superpod which will accelerate our processing capacity to innovate reduce risk and launch aienabled capabilities our people have identified hundreds of use cases across bny mellon and we already have several in production today across the company its our people who continue to power our culture if you were to walk the halls of bny mellon youd feel the energy and sense of purpose our leadership team feels when we visit our teams around the world to that end were investing in our people over the past several months we launched new learning and feedback platforms powered by ai expanded employee benefits launched a new wellbeing support program improved and accelerated our year end feedback and compensation processes and more and were delighted to welcome shannon hobbs who will join us as our new chief people officer in june as we continue to power our culture forward we adopted the following five core principles to guide how our teams work and collaborate as we drive our success as a company be clientobsessed spark progress own it stay curious and thrive together to wrap up our performance in the first quarter provides a glimpse of bny mellons potential running our company better inclusive of our focus on platforms is enabling us to improve profitability and invest in our future while we are pleased to see early signs of progress we remain focused on the significant work ahead of us as we become more for our clients and deliver higher performance for our shareholders the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 as ive said before the transformation of our company is a multiyear endeavor but weve started the year of our 240th anniversary with a sense of excitement and determination around whats possible now over to you dermot dermot william mcdonogh chief financial officer and memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp thank you robin and good morning everyone referring to page of the presentation ill start with our consolidated financial results for the quarter total revenue of billion was up yearoveryear fee revenue was up this reflects growth in investment services fees on the back of higher market values increased client activity and net new business partially offset by a decline in foreign exchange revenue as a result of lower market volatility firmwide assets under custody andor administration of trillion were up yearoveryear and assets under management of trillion were up yearoveryear both largely reflecting higher market values investment and other revenue was million in the quarter effective january we adopted new accounting guidance for our investments in renewable energy projects resulting in an approximately million increase to investment and other revenue we have restated prior periods in our earnings materials to provide you with like forlike yearoveryear and sequential comparisons the adoption of this new accounting guidance is largely neutral to net income and earnings per share as the increase in provision for income taxes roughly equals the increase in investment and other revenue net interest income decreased by yearoveryear primarily reflecting changes in the composition of deposits partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates expenses were up yearoveryear on a reported basis and up excluding notable items primarily severance expense growth was from incremental investments and employee merit increases offset by efficiency savings provision for credit losses was million in the quarter primarily driven by reserve increases related to commercial real estate exposure as robin mentioned earlier we reported earnings per share of up yearoveryear a pretax margin of and a return on tangible common equity of excluding notable items earnings per share were up yearoveryear pretax margin was and our return on tangible common equity was turning to capital and liquidity on page our tier leverage ratio for the quarter was average assets increased by sequentially as deposit balances grew and tier capital decreased by sequentially primarily reflecting capital return to common shareholders partially offset by capital generated through earnings our cet1 ratio at the end of the quarter was the quarteroverquarter decline reflects a temporary increase in riskweighted assets at the end of the quarter which was driven by discrete overdrafts in our custody and securities clearing businesses as well as strong demand for our agency securities lending program consistent with tier capital cet1 capital decreased by sequentially over the course of the quarter we returned billion of capital to our shareholders representing a total payout ratio of turning to liquidity our regulatory ratios remained strong the consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was flat sequentially and our consolidated net stable funding ratio was up percentage point sequentially the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 moving on to net interest income and the underlying balance sheet trends on page net interest income of over billion was down yearoveryear and down quarteroverquarter the sequential decrease was primarily driven by changes in the composition of deposits partially offset by the benefit of reinvesting maturing fixed rate securities in higher yielding alternatives against typical seasonal patterns average deposit balances increased by sequentially solid growth in interestbearing deposits was partially offset by a decline in noninterestbearing deposits which was in line with our expectations average interestearning assets were up quarteroverquarter we reduced our cash and reverse repo balances by and increased our investment securities portfolio by average loan balances remained flat turning to our business segments starting on page please remember that in the first quarter we made certain realignments of similar products and services across our lines of business consistent with our work to operate as a more unified company as robin mentioned earlier the largest change was the movement of institutional solutions from pershing to clearance and collateral management both in the market and wealth services segment and we made other smaller changes across our business segments we have restated prior periods for consistency please refer to the revised financial supplement that we filed on march for detailed reconciliations to previous disclosures now starting with securities services on page securities services reported total revenue of billion up yearoveryear investment services fees were up yearoveryear in asset servicing investment services fees were up driven by higher market values net new business and higher client activity weve remained focused on deal margins and as a result the yearoveryear impact of repricing on fee growth was de minimis consistent with past quarters we continue to see particular success with our etf offering etf assets under custody andor administration surpassed trillion this quarter up over yearoveryear on the back of higher market values net new business and client flows and the number of funds serviced was up yearoveryear while the pace of alternative fund launches was slower than in the prior year quarter investment services fees for alternatives were up over on a yearoveryear basis throughout the quarter we saw broadbased strength across client segments products and regions in issuer services investment services fees were up reflecting net new business across both depository receipts and corporate trust as well as higher cancellation fees in depository receipts foreign exchange revenue was down yearoveryear and net interest income was down expenses up billion were flat yearoveryear reflecting incremental investments as well as the impact of employee merit increases offset by efficiency savings pretax income was million a increase yearoveryear and pre tax margin expanded to next market and wealth services on page market and wealth services reported total revenue of billion up yearoveryear total investment services fees were up yearoveryear the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 in pershing investment services fees were up reflecting higher market values and client activity partially offset by the impact of business lost in the prior year net new assets were negative billion for the quarter reflecting the ongoing deconversion of the beforementioned lost business client demand for our wealth advisor platform wove continues to be strong in the first quarter we signed nine additional client agreements including our first direct indexing clients and we onboarded four clients onto the platform in treasury services investment services fees increased by driven by net new business we continue to invest in our sales and service teams new products and technology and so we are pleased with this solid growth and momentum continues to build last but not least strength in clearance and collateral management continued with investment services fees up on the back of broadbased growth both in the us and internationally net interest income for the segment overall was down yearoveryear expenses of million were up yearoveryear reflecting incremental investments revenue related expenses and employee merit increases partially offset by efficiency savings pretax income was down yearoveryear at million representing a pretax margin moving on to investment and wealth management on page investment and wealth management reported total revenue of million up yearoveryear in investment management revenue was up driven by higher market values partially offset by the mix of aum flows and lower performance fees in our wealth management business revenue also increased by driven by higher market values partially offset by changes in product mix and lower net interest income expenses of million were flat yearoveryear primarily reflecting the impact of incremental investments and employee merit increases which is offset by efficiency savings pretax income was million up year overyear representing a pretax margin of as i mentioned earlier assets under management of trillion increased by yearoveryear in the quarter we saw billion of net inflows into our longterm active strategies with strength in ldi and fixed income and we saw billion of net outflows from index strategies strength in our shortterm cash strategies continued with billion of net inflows on the back of differentiated investment performance in our dreyfus money market fund complex wealth management client assets of billion increased by yearoveryear reflecting higher equity market values and cumulative net inflows page shows the results of the other segment i will close by reiterating our existing outlook for the fullyear as ive said before we have positioned our balance sheet for a range of interest rate scenarios and were managing both sides of it proactively and so despite the repricing of the curve since the beginning of the year we continue to expect net interest income for the fullyear to be down yearoveryear assuming current marketimplied interest rates for the remainder of the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 similarly on expenses our goal continues to be for fullyear expenses excluding notable items to be flat yearoveryear we are off to a good start but we have more work ahead of us to realize further efficiency savings and drive yearoveryear expense growth rates lower over the coming quarters while we continue to make room for additional investments across our businesses overall we remain determined to deliver some positive operating leverage this year while we dont manage the firm to operating leverage on a quarterly basis our performance in the first quarter with positive operating leverage on both a reported and an operating basis gives us confidence that were on track in light of the adoption of the new accounting guidance for our investments in renewable energy projects which as i discussed earlier increases both our investment and other revenue and the provision for income taxes ill note that we expect our effective tax rate for the fullyear to be between and and finally we continue to expect returning or more of earnings to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks over the course of the year as always we will manage share repurchases cognizant of the macroeconomic environment balance sheet size and many other factors and so for the foreseeable future we will calibrate the pace of buybacks to maintain our tier leverage ratio close to the top end of our to mediumterm target range to wrap up over the past three months weve made good progress towards achieving our targets for and were encouraged by the drive were seeing in all corners of the firm as our people embrace being more for our clients running our company better and powering our culture with that operator can you please open the line for qa the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hi good morning thanks for the question so robin really nice progress on organic growth initiatives across a handful of businesses underneath bny mellon as some of the things you talked about are starting to take hold can you maybe frame what the firms organic growth rate aspirations are for the next couple of years how are you thinking about that for as well and then as a side question i guess to that weve seen quite significant amount of activity in clearance and collateral management can you maybe help size what is sort of transitory versus more of a recurrent baseline to think about from here thanks robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure alex good morning so let me start with the growth question as you point out we are feeling quite good about the early momentum that we have in growth as you know we set it out last year to really get our house in order generate positive operating leverage and really think about the various different investments to drive sort of shorter medium and longerterm growth and thats really what weve been focused on and were pleased that weve got a good start to the year on it clearly were trying to control the things that we can control as i mentioned in my prepared remarks and as dermot touched on as well our focus here is really being wrapped around being more for our clients our commercial model we hired our first chief commercial officer were operationalizing 1bny mellon as i called it the nutsandbolts kind of getting into building that into our client coverage organization our coverage practice starting to deliver integrated solutions i gave a couple of examples of those in my prepared remarks and weve got a whole bunch more things that really cut across all of the different segments that are related to that so look its early in the journey i would have said maybe last year we were working the problem i think now i would say were working the opportunity could you just remind me the second part of your question alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah sure really nice results out of clearance and collateral management for the firm and its been a pretty active market in  related to treasury issuance and activity there broadly im just trying to get a sense for a better baseline to think about from here was there anything kind of transitory in the first quarter that helped the numbers or this is a good baseline to think about going forward robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp look i would say in terms of transitory not really but let me just go through a few of the drivers so remember that its a business that like several of the businesses we have respond to volumes and it was an active quarter when it comes to trading volumes in the us treasury market now for better or for worse us treasuries is kind of a growth business and so thats probably a bit more of a secular tailwind as opposed to something cyclical the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 and then remember under the hood in clearance and collateral management weve also been investing in the operating model of that business as we talked about in our prepared remarks and took something that was very very adjacent to our clearing business from pershing institutional clearing and aligned it with the rest of our clearing bigger clearing business in clearance and collateral management and what were finding now in those conversations with customers its a much cleaner conversation because weve got the ability to deliver all the solutions in our clearing business whether its us treasuries whether its international whether its the different models of clearing that we offer were able to deliver that in one conversation with the client and clients are responding to that so i would call that secular as well alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks so much ill hop back in the queue robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks alex operator and our next question comes from the line of steven chubak from wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning robin and good morning dermot robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning steven steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so wanted to start with a question on capital a bit of a twoparter if you will i was hoping you could just speak to the drivers of rwa growth in which was fairly robust where youre seeing attractive opportunities to deploy that excess capital and just how we should be thinking about the cadence of the buyback you alluded to this somewhat dermot but i was hoping we could drill down into you noted the target or that upper bound on tier leverage is how should we be thinking about the cadence of buyback in light of planned balance sheet actions and growth potential dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer and memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp okay ill take that one steven good morning so some of the capital increase there are two parts to the rwa increase one was a kind of temporary increase around quarter end as it relates to discrete overdrafts in custody and securities clearing businesses so thats kind of come and gone and then theres also there was strong demand for our agency securities lending program throughout the quarter and particularly leading up to quarter end and thats continued into this quarter so thats so i would say half of it was that and half of it was temporary the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 as it relates to the buyback i guess theres a little bit of a groundhog day here in terms of how we thought about  of last year versus how were thinking about  of this year both quarters we got off to a strong start but look theres a lot of rate volatility out there in the market youve seen the backup in rates last week with the hot inflation report last year it was the war in ukraine this year its the geopolitics in the middle east and so we kind of gave a guidance in january where we said we were going to be 100more of earnings throughout the year we dont give quarterbyquarter guidance i would reiterate the guidance of or more notwithstanding the fact  was very good at i wouldnt expect that pace to continue but well take it quarterbyquarter steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc understood and for my followup maybe just drilling down into the investment and wealth sic wealth management margins in particular since across the other segments were seeing continued progress towards the longerterm targets thats admittedly the segment with the biggest shortfall i know in the prepared remarks dermot you noted that youre making investments in the business and just wanted to better understand one where are those dollars getting deployed and maybe if you could just speak to the primary drivers underpinning that glide path to how much is contingent on revenue growth versus expense optimization dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer and memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp okay so the first point would be pretax margin for the  there was around if you normalize that for typical seasonal volatility in terms of retirement eligible stock and such like if you back that out and adjusted the margin would have been somewhere in the zip code so we feel pretty good about that still a ton of work to do and i would say its not one thing over the other it depends on which part of the business youre talking about in some of our asset managers were investing were launching new products clients in some places continue to derisk and move from more riskon equity to passive fixed income but in other cases we see clients coming in and aum growing we were very pleased with the performance of our dreyfus cash management business in  where we saw strong inflows and the performance of the business in terms of returns was first quartile so we feel very good about that so we are investing the business to give our clients good products to invest in the flip side is we still believe as it relates to running the company better and desiloing the firm and connecting asset management to the broader enterprise theres a lot of opportunity there and at the same time as the opportunity it allows us to take cost out and become a lot more efficient so i would say were working both sides of it we see more opportunity on the revenue side and were working the problem on the efficiency side steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful color thanks so much for taking my questions operator our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 hi i had two questions one was just on the ai commentary that you were leading with in the prepared remarks and i wanted to understand how youre thinking about the benefits to the expense ratio and the timeframe with which this is going to flow through because theres clearly revenue enhancing opportunities and expense reducing or flattening and how much of this ai investment is how important is it to your expense outlook and yeah if you could give us the mediumterm outlook that would be helpful thanks robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure hi betsy first of all its great to have you on the call really glad to have you back and to know that youre doing well betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks so much robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so on the ai ill start with the sort of the latter part of your question which is i really dont think this is a story of course were doing things in but if you ask me to try to put a pin in where the real benefits and sort of tailwinds kick in im actually going to say its not even necessarily a story although maybe well see a little bit in i think this is a and on out benefit on the expense line but let me go back to the premise of your question and just sort of briefly mention how were embracing it so ill put it actually through the three pillars that weve laid out in terms that are guiding so much of what were doing in the company so first being more for our clients we think there are solutions out there for clients that are going to help them make better decisions see risks be able to be more efficient themselves weve got software in market today doing that with predictive trade analytics around fails and settlements allowing clients to be able to look out to see and take evasive action essentially on potential fails and by the way some of those actions involve using other parts of the bny mellon platforms in order to be able to improve their businesses and so thats an interesting example and there are going to be a lot more of those under the heading of running our company better this is going to be about streamlining business processes productivity figuring out and seeing anomalies that we can see a code assistant as so many people talk about for our developers i was walking around one of our buildings the other day talking to one of our developers theyve been out of school for a year and change and already they think theyre more productive as a developer and thats in the very early days of using github copilot so theres going to be more there and that ultimately is going to create efficiencies for us and then under the culture heading which is very important we want ai to empower our people to be able to go out and be able to be more efficient in terms of what theyre doing and there are any number of different examples of things over time that we think ai is going to be able to help with us now importantly in this is the way in which were doing it both dermot and i talked about platforms and another concept in our platform strategy is to create these hubs these centers of excellence and in ai thats particularly important we do not want to repeat the problems weve had in the past of having everyone go off in their own the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 direction and actually in ai its particularly important because problem statements that sound different can in fact have very common root causes so you might want to be able to respond to an rfp you might want to generate summaries of documents you might want to be able to get a head start on a research report but actually when you look under the heading those three things sound different but the ai thats actually powering them some of the mini platforms that are required are very very similar so were using our ai hub to collect these different use cases and then be able to deliver solutions and mini ai platforms that can then be used in multiple places around the company so were excited about this we think its going to be very significant over time but its not a story betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay got it thats super helpful with the color i appreciate that and then just a followup on the tax rate guidance this is part of the accounting change i believe is that right and can you tell us where in the ph ppop the offsets are thanks dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer and memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp sorry i missed the last part of it betsy where ph ppop betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc theres offsets right to the tax the tax is impacted by the accounting change is that right dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer and memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp yeah so economically its net neutral for the firm its just a gross up in revenue which will show up in the interest sic investment and other revenue line and then the offset to that is in the tax line and we filed an 8k a couple of weeks ago where we restated all the prior periods for comparison so that people will see it on a consistent basis going forward betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc sure i just wanted to highlight that your tax rate guide has the offsets in the revenue so appreciate that robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 operator our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you good morning robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess im not sure dermot if this was addressed hey robin but give us in terms of your outlook on deposits i think the period end saw a pretty big uptick to billion just give us a sense of within your nii guidance one what are you assuming in terms of deposit balances and secondly if the forward curve holds is the next inflection on nii and margin higher or lower thank you dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer and memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so as of the quarter end ebrahim i think the spot number was around billion of deposits and that was largely you may recall that quarter end this year fell on a good friday where markets were closed so weve got a lot of clients putting cash in so that they could make certain payments and so we saw kind of a surge in deposits over the last few days of the quarter and theyve largely left the system now and weve returned to more normal levels which is in the kind of high billion range so thats really the explanation for the spot deposit balance versus the average trend so sequentially were down in the deposits or nii and yearoveryear and we saw growth in the deposit balance generally speaking our guide at the beginning of the year was down and given the rate volatility and whats going on with the inflation report last week and the backup in rates et cetera et cetera we dont see theres nothing thats causing us to think that we should change our guidance between now and the balance of the year were very neutrally positioned as to whether rates go up a little bit from here or down a little bit from here and we feel very good about the overall guidance that we gave in january which was approximately down ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess one followup in terms of some of the actions you took in moving businesses in pershing as we think about the strategic review i guess robin maybe it began a year ago or longer than that give us a sense of in terms of the franchise positioning how the businesses are talking to each other and if theyre in the right place within the enterprise is all of that done how close are you to getting the franchise synced up in terms of where its coming along with regards to what you want to achieve in terms of client synergies thank you robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 so the punchline is were making good progress but youre essentially asking a cultural question and were not done on that so when we did to go back to your point when we did our original strategy reviews which is months or so ago now took us a few months to go through we were really focused on answering the questions of what are we doing are we doing the right things how are we doing them are we doing them in the right way do we have the right people doing them and so we looked at that and we certainly found bits of the company that were just in the wrong place and so weve lifted those bits up and weve put them in what we now think are the right place so thats what both dermot and i talked about in our prepared remarks and that was what some of the restatement of prior periods so that you could make the easier comparisons there was about that was basic blocking and tackling but the bigger opportunity for sure is how the businesses work together not only to be more for clients by saying hey that client over there is a client but theyre not my client in my business can we work together to basically make them a client of both businesses thats very significant thats where we talk about maturing 1bny mellon into the real heart of a new commercial coverage model and thats being driven by our chief commercial officer another part of this is saying there are things that we used to think of as standalone capabilities some might call them products we think about them as client platforms and in fact what the client is asking for and we really heard this when we did our voice of client survey they dont want these individual products they want us to take them and weave them together to create solutions for them that are on point to their needs and so weve also started to do that and i mentioned some examples of that and thats a very powerful thing because that takes the breadth of our company and rather than it being siloed which is getting in the way of solutions its now actually ending up being the opportunity for us to deliver from the breadth of our platforms to our clients with solutions that frankly some other people arent going to be able to do so thats we think very exciting and in those journeys were still relatively early and that is cultural and weve been doing a lot of things internally in the firm to make sure that our people are lined up behind that its early days but were quite excited about the direction of travel ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and thank you both operator and our next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank good morning thanks for taking my questions id like to start dermot when you were walking through pershing i believe you talked about the offboarding and the impact of how that was weighing on the net new assets could you give us an update on how far we are along in that offboarding process and how much we should continue to expect for the rest of the year and then also lpl recently announced the acquisition of atria which i understand was a pershing client and theyre planning to consolidate those operations in so is that going to extend maybe some of the headwinds that were seeing from some of these idiosyncratic offboardings the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer and memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp okay thanks for the question so the first thing i would say about pershing in the context of the overall the segment with respect to pershing we continue to invest in pershing pershing continues to grow and as weve said since the deconversion was announced were going to earn our way out of this situation and thats whats happening so we still as a business feel very good about pershing and our ability its a market thats growing in midsingle digits on an annual basis and were a big player in that market so were going to win our share so while the deconversion was unfortunate we continue to march on and well earn our way out specifically i would say well be largely done with the deconversion by  of this year and as it relates to the second part i would say look were in a competitive market people are going to do things the lpl atria thing its not a particular headwind its not been highlighted to me its not hit my radar in terms of oh my gosh we need to worry about that and so i think were winning more than were losing and were investing and thats really going well and when you take it in the context of whats going on with wove were building a strong pipeline there the backlog is looking good weve added sic signed nine clients to the platform in  of this year and we made a commitment to the market that we would kind of add million to million of revenue this year and we still feel very good about that guidance and that commitment that we made to you back in january robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp and brennan id just add on the business fronts to that which is remember when we look the deconversion for sure those happen and the one that youre referring to the original one was a larger one but were also growing with our clients our clients are growing with us and we also are on the receiving end of rollups as well our clients are quite acquisitive and we have a couple of clients whove been doing acquisitions and we have some of our largest clients who are growing very significantly and very healthily so its always unfortunate when theres a rollup that goes against us but when there are rollups that go with our clients those things balance out to some extent which is why dermot makes the point about overall we still feel quite enthusiastic about the net new assets growth over time brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank great thanks for that color and then when we think about the deposits im trying to think about really dermot the fact that here we are one quarter in i get it you maybe dont want to update expectations but it seems like based on what weve seen so far deposit trends seem to be doing better than expected we saw a pickup in the deposit balances at yearend they sustained which is a little unusual and even though theyve come down from ph eop at theyre still in a similar ballpark to where you were on the average are you guys is there something specific thats driving the expectation for deposit decline or is it just a component of conservatism dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer and memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp if im honest with you i would say its a little bit of both but i would expect like everybody expected deposits to decline this year and it hasnt necessarily happened yet and i make that statement in the context of qt and so if you look at the rrp in  the drain largely came from there the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 and if qt continues and rates stay higher for longer on balance i would expect deposits to decline from here and so i dont see anything that tells me that i should update the guidance from down nii yearoveryear and then underneath the hood in terms of the composition of the deposits themselves you have the mix between interestbearing and noninterestbearing and as rates stay higher for longer i would expect nibs to grind a little bit lower so the overall balance may be higher but you have the mix underneath which will kind of feed into that overall nii guidance so its not just the absolute level its also the composition of it brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank yeah no thats great thanks for the candor and embracing the uncertainty operator our next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp hi mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc can you hear me so noninterestbearing deposits inched down again and im just wondering where that floor is i guess its versus last quarter and yearoveryear and so on the other hand your servicing fees were up yearoveryear so im not sure if i should draw a link or not maybe what youre not getting in noninterestbearing deposits youre getting in servicing fees so the question is how are you getting such strong servicing fee growth yearoveryear of how much of that is due to markets how much of that is sustainable and is any of that simply a substitution effect from the non interestbearing deposits to servicing fees dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer and memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp thanks for the question mike so lets go with the fee component first  is kind of one of those quarters where we came into the year i guess both in deposits and in pipeline and sales activity in very good shape as it relates to kind of asset servicing in particular the pipeline was strong we felt good coming into the year markets rallied nicely and so clients were in riskon mode doing more with us flows were stronger balances are higher and were winning our share of mandates little factoid of all the deals that we competed for in  we won north of so were competitive were pricing well were very focused on client profitability and deal margin and it goes back to the point that we made in several quarters prior to this where were very focused on the cost to serve and so by improving margin focusing on cost to serve being more for clients we can be more competitive in the pricing point and i made that remark i made the point in my prepared remarks that we saw repricing being de minimis so it was a good quarter all around and we feel very good about the backlog and the pipeline going forward the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 as it relates to the mix between fees and deposits we dont lead with deposits as an institution clients do multiple things with us across the enterprise and as a consequence of that they leave deposits with us its an important point but twothirds of our deposits are operational in nature and therefore very sticky but with a higher for longer rate environment its only natural to expect that people with nibs are going to over time move out of that and look for a higher yield its inevitable and its a fact of life and were ready to deal with that but im very proud of what our global liquidity solutions team is doing in terms of winning their share of the business in terms of the deposits and how we price them and so sequentially weve seen the balances go up because of that competitive pricing so allinall when you take the ecosystem together we feel very good about where were at robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp and mike there was nothing idiosyncratic about tradeoffs to the other part of your question i dont see the quarter built around that at all mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and so a separate question for all the growth in servicing fees asset management what can you do to reverse the trends for sustainable growth i mean would it ever be an option to consider selling that as to synergies when you think about 1bny mellon i kind of get the rest of the firm being all one cohesive unit over time but how does asset management fit into that robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure so this is the question that we talked a little bit about last year and i said at the time that we think and ill underline the word think that the business really can complement the strategy of the firm but we had more work to do and that that was a thesis and we needed to put in place the various different steps to really be able to operationalize and make the most of that and thats what weve been working on over the course of the past few months the basic thesis is we think theres a strong industrial logic to have trillion worth of manufacturing platform aligned to bny mellons trillion worth of retail distribution capacity if you look across wealth and pershing together pershing alone having 25trillionplus of client assets on the platform and so if you only operate it in a silo in investment management where it was manufacturing and only its own distribution theres a legitimate question there about whether or not it would have the scale and the capacity to be able to truly compete but when you put it together with the rest of the company we think theres a pretty compelling thesis there and so we dont think weve properly capitalized on those benefits in the past and so our strategy is lets let investment management stretch its legs in that new approach and we see some early signs of progress on that weve been joining some dots i mentioned a couple of things in my prepared remarks both in terms of us having a broader distribution platform that actually can attract other investment managers who maybe dont have the benefit of our distribution and they want to come join our platform rounding out our offerings and essentially making our distribution platform more complete but also being attractive to them so they dont have to build their own if you will theyre building their business on one of our the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 platforms and so weve given you our targets we want to be able to expand the pretax margin in the business to over its not for nothing that we didnt grow expenses in that segment or in securities services for that matter because were really focused on the margin in those businesses and we have had some growth and so this is about really working that set of opportunities and well see over the coming quarters how we do but this quarter was one where we felt we took an important step forward mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks operator and our next question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp hey glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi you havent mentioned it so maybe it wasnt that big of a deal but t1 starts at the end of may im curious if it was a big expense lift that we get some relief on going forward and then related to that are there any headwinds on nii and any benefits on capital that we have to think about as a result of moving towards a more t1 world thank you robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so t1 sure we had to for sure spend money in different parts of the company in order to be able to ready ourselves for this we view that as frankly ordinary course of business theres always some market structure change going on in the world that we have to respond to so while they may be individually lumpy theres always something so we just think about that as part of the expense of running the company and not something that will yield a particular benefit when we happen to have finished the work now i do think that t1 overall provides benefits to the financial system improvements in efficiency some risk reduction i would say to the second part of your question that more of that probably accrues to our clients because were not as big a principal player there it can improve liquidity and capital requirements in the fullness of time the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 the industry has come a long way it wasnt that long ago that we were at t5 t3 sort of moving down the curve and i will also say from an opportunity point of view not only do clients look to us to help them navigate these types of things because theyre complicated and detailed and they want us to essentially help them in executing this type of change and thats exactly what weve been doing but we also think that there are just opportunities associated with these sorts of inflections because clients look at us and it does sometimes cause the question to be raised of another big change in the posttrade landscape lifes too short im an investment manager or im a broker dealer i want to go about the core of my business i dont want to have to worry about that stuff as much as i currently do bny mellon can you help us can you help us and maybe theres a platform sale opportunity there for a little bit more outsourcing because as the world makes these changes speeds up gets more complicated more change management we of course have the benefit of scale we get to change once and we get to take some of those problems off their hands and so id call that out when it comes to realtime payments id call it out in t1 id call it out in clearing each time these things happen we look at it through a lens of opportunity as well as a lens of client service but overall also just good for the market nothing good happens between trading and settlement as is often said dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer and memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp and glenn on the specific glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thanks dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer and memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp point about headwinds as it relates to nii i kind of i look at the last two quarters together in terms of the strength of what weve done on nii and i feel overall were in a good place the balance sheet is very clean our cio book is well positioned and short duration and the cio is doing a really good job of optimizing yield and so when you see our securities that are maturing at the moment theyre rolling off at a kind of to rate and then are being deployed at current market yields so based on what i see today with the backup in rates that happened last week as a result of the hot inflation report we feel pretty good about where things are for the balance of the year just using that forward curve as i said earlier rates up a little down a little dont materially impact us and so we feel like our base case is we feel pretty good about it glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thank you all operator our next question is going to come from gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi robin hi dermot the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp hey gerard dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer and memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc dermot can you give us some color i noticed you said in your prepared remarks the average loan balances were essentially flat in  versus  a bit but i noticed the spot number quarter end number for loans was actually quite a bit higher around billion versus the spot number in the fourth quarter was it something at the end of the quarter that caused that to increase dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer and memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp thanks gerard again it was a little bit of what i call the good friday effect where clients use our overdraft facility mechanisms going into that weekend and so that really caused the spot balances to go up and thats kind of largely cleaned out so it has reverted more to the average numbers that youre familiar with gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good and i know this is not a big area for you guys so maybe you could give us better insights since its not as big as it is for a traditional bank but can you maybe give us some color on the commercial real estate i know you pointed out youve built up the allowances there what are you guys seeing is it similar to what were reading about and hearing from others or is it something different dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer and memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so i would say look were prudently marked in the commercial real estate portfolio overall our cre sic office cre portfolio in the context of our overall balance sheet is quite small of total loans billion and the reserve build that we took in  was really being prudent on a couple of specific situations that are coming up for restructuring but i would let you know that theyre all still paying and everything is working and theyre class a office buildings and we feel good about the occupancy so i would say overall very very clean and nothing that really has me unduly concerned and look there has been a lot of chatter in the market in the press over the last quarter about whats going to happen im sure the backup in rates hasnt really helped that chatter but like surveying other banks results so far this quarter i havent really noticed any specific cre builds on the back of whats been going on over the last couple of quarters so it does feel like as a sentiment matter to be quite muted at the moment on the back of others earnings release thats at least what ive observed robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 and gerard id just add to that for the more general view which is i think the answer to what happens in corporate real estate clearly it depends which markets youre involved in there are some markets around the country that are more distressed than others it continues to be focused on office as you know although there are certainly some questions on multifamily but the fact that were sort of still short housing in the us as a general matter is probably ultimately going to be helpful to that story the single most important driver of it as we sit here today is where are longerterm rates and so theres so much chatter about whats going to happen in fed funds is the fed going to cut or are they going to stay are they going to hike a little bit but what really matters is where is the curve from to years and as that backsup and to the extent that we cross you get very different outcomes on commercial real estate than you do if years are at and if they ended up for some reason not our base case but its possible youve got to plan for it if they end up at then for some folks in the market thats going to be a much more painful outcome so i think you watch so goes the 10year to some extent so goes the commercial real estate market because this is a a little bit but really refinancing story gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you appreciate those insights thank you operator our next question comes from the line of david smith with autonomous research please go ahead david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp good afternoon could you please help us think a little bit more about how far you are along you are in the efficiency opportunity journey i know its really never ending in some ways but can you help us think about when the pace of improvement might start to decline as you get through more of the lowhanging fruit dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer and memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so thanks for the question i was wondering when it was going to come its a multiyear journey and look lets go back to last year and kind of go through it and last year we kind of ended up at versus a guide of versus the previous year of and this year weve guided flat and we started  on an operating basis of youll see that our head count weve largely give or take a few hundred people is largely flat and so the head count is flat we feel like we have our arms wrapped around that theres a lot going under the hood in terms of bringing in like growing our analyst class highvalue location growth et cetera et cetera so we see a lot of opportunity to continue to improve the efficiency story also as we both said in our prepared remarks the migration to a new way of working the platforms operating model over the next couple of years we feel will not only help us grow top line but it will also just help us run the company better and i think its quite important culturally that we dont really talk about efficiency internally we talk about running our company better which is very important strategically and also culturally the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 so i think youre going to see quarterbyquarter proof points on how were able to run the company better which will result in efficiency which will then in turn result in improved margin so we feel very optimistic about whats coming david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp thank you and lastly just to confirm the billion or so of buyback in does that come out of the billion new repurchase authorization or is the billion incremental to what you did in dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer and memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so we did an authorization last year which was billion we have a little bit left in that and so its just more of an administration thing that we decided to get another authorization this year for billion thats largely open ended so i wouldnt really dwell on the size of the authorization that much its just more of what we commit to you doing on an annual basis and the key thing for you to take away is were committing to north of this year david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp got it thank you robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks david operator our next question comes from the line of brian bedell with deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks for taking my questions most of them have been asked and answered but maybe just a couple of followups one a little bit on that prior question dermot i guess this could be for robin as well i think robin you mentioned earlier in the call about of staff are in the new operating model maybe if you could just talk about your migration plan over time and going back to what you just answered dermot about the efficiency improvement should we be thinking of this over the longterm as maybe roughly even between expenses and revenue or still more geared towards expenses robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay let me just start with the platforms operating model so ultimately if you just go back to why are we doing what it is that were doing weve been pretty siloed as a company as weve talked about before we think thats a bad artifact at least its a bad artifact for a company like us which is inherently a scale platforms provider its kind of the nature of our business diversified many different platforms but largely at scale and so to have the separation of all of these pieces that are in support of that and in some cases duplication it just in our opinion wasnt the right way to run the company the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 so what is platforms operating model going to do its going to simplify how we work its going to improve the client experience and its going to create more empowerment for our employees its an opportunity to do things in one place do them well and elevate the quality of overall execution and so with that said it sort of hits on the expense line as a benefit and it hits on the revenue line as well and weve done remember we did a bunch of studies for this before we embarked on it because a pretty significant change we also did some pilots and to some extent weve even built new businesses using this operating rhythm because we built wove in that way and that wasnt entirely by accident so weve had some experience associated with all of that and we feel pretty good therefore that we are going to get expense savings and revenue opportunities associated with it we also think that from a cultural point of view its just an opportunity for our people because we think our people and this is certainly what the data so far has shown they just feel more empowered working in the model they can see a problem they can get on it more quickly theyre more empowered to pull the levers to create change and they no longer feel that maybe theyre part of a long chain of bureaucracy to make change on the efficiency opportunity thing the thing i would add in answer to your question from what dermot said earlier on is just to reinforce that there are short medium and longterm opportunities for efficiencies and weve talked about it this way for a while now as dermot said we had to bend the cost curve last year we thought it was very important so we took a bunch of slightly tactical but nonetheless important and decisive changes we also laid the groundwork for some mediumterm saves we talked about project catalyst ideas sourced from our employees essentially delivering savings in and and and then weve got things that are longer term like the platforms operating model which are fundamentally changing the ways that people actually work thats a longerterm opportunity probably get a little bit of benefit from that from but and are places where well probably see a bit more of that and then an answer to betsys question from earlier on weve been investing in ai thats definitely not a story for benefits maybe not even but a and beyond story so were layering in these different opportunities recognizing that we wanted to take swift action but then we also feel that were laying the seeds for future efficiencies over time brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc ph got it dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer and memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp and i would just brian just to add on i would just anchor you in a number like last year when we grew expenses by we invested billion in new initiatives within that and were replicating that again this year and so as somebody whos very close to the platforms operating model strategy the cultural point is when you walk the corridors of bny mellon now you feel an energy and enthusiasm for our people as robin said from embracing the model that hasnt been seen before and it is a very very exciting strategy thats going on at the firm the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats fantastic color and maybe just one last one on the speaking of initiatives the buy side trading solutions initiative i know weve had a lot of other initiatives to talk about so just maybe to get an update on how thats tracking robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah ill take this one this was always going to be a mediumterm thing as weve told you we sort of have this capability inhouse its a great example of platforms thinking it was captive in one bit of the company only looking internally we essentially made it fit for external use as well we onboarded as we told you last quarter a large client onto that platform and thats been going very well i have a lot of conversations with clients about how they could consider part of their trading desks to be outsourced sometimes its all of it sometimes its a region or a product that somebody wants to essentially say hey im not at scale youre at scale youre executing trillion worth of volumes can i rent that capability from you essentially we think theres a large addressable market here but its going to be this is a longer sell process the sales cycle of this takes longer its definitely a csuite conversation but we continue to be cautiously optimistic about this over time brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks for all the color thank you so much robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks brian operator our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks i know were getting on here ill try to ask just a couple of quick cleanups first of all this is the first quarter that the securities book has actually grown in absolute terms and im just wondering is part of that an increased confidence in just where you do expect deposits to land or was it more just opportunity cost of what your options were in the market dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer and memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp thanks ken i would say very much the latter and when you look at the overall portfolio you think of cash and securities together and it was really the cio team just optimizing yield and deploying cash where they see the opportunities the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah okay and then i know you said a little bit of this before but i was wondering if you could tighten up last quarter you said to glenns question you talked about reinvesting at market rate so last quarter you put that together and said that you would expect that this years reinvestments to be basis points to basis points on your rollon rolloff and with higher rates im just wondering if you kind of put that together for us like what do you think that net benefit is now versus that basis points to basis points dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer and memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp i think its in the basis points zip code ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then last one just duration of the portfolio can you just give us an update on where that stands dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer and memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp roughly two years give or take two years is the best number to give you on that one ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay so to your point like still keeping really short and opportunistic dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer and memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp correct yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc all right great thanks a lot operator and our final question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i just when you mentioned your comments about commercial real estate i was just wondering i dont think you have much exposure but you highlighted that commercial real estate i guess for the industry or are you talking office you said its really a refinancing story and as goes the 10year as goes commercial real estate its just if you could provide any color why did you highlight that and why do you have that sort of conclusion thanks robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 well the question mike was more general in nature it wasnt really applying to us dermot talked a little bit about us in particular on commercial real estate but i think the question that was being asked was just using our vantage point i think it was from gerard just using our vantage point in the world because were not particularly invested in the space what do we see in the world maybe as a slightly less conflicted observer and so i was just giving my perspective on it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah from your perspective im just curious interested as goes the 10year its a refinancing story any color behind that robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure so at the end of the day as you look at the various different owners of commercial real estate who have refinancings and theyre looking at their own occupancy level theyre looking at their own maturity of their own debt stack and they need to go out and they need to find a refinancing of course as you know better than anybody when their debt stack starts to come due that isnt a fed funds type of refinancing because theyre not for funding of very short dates and most of them for understandable reasons like to lock in funding as well so theyre looking further out the curve its not precisely at the 10year point but my point really is the risk to refinancing in the commercial real estate space is very correlated to the shape of the treasury curve overall clearly credit spreads matter as well but its a different proposition when you have the longer call it years but its probably a little inside of that part of the curve at versus versus and that was the purpose of my observation mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thats helpful thank you robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp youre welcome operator and with that that does conclude our questionandanswer session for today i would now like to hand the call back over to robin with any additional or closing remarks robin antony vince president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you operator id just like to wrapup by thanking our employees for their hard work to unlock the tremendous opportunity inside of bny mellon we started
