reported strong third quarter results reflecting growth across our three business segments and consistent execution on our strategic priorities stepping back on the macroside for a moment at the beginning of the year markets had priced in significant monetary policy easing in anticipation of economic slowdowns despite numerous shifts in the macroeconomic outlook since then weve now seen the start of the easing cycle in several markets around the world including a 50basis point reduction in policy rates in the us as the federal reserve recalibrates its policy stance to balance employment inflation and growth following increased market volatility and a selloff in equities in early august markets recovered and both equity and fixed income values ended the quarter higher a little more micro but relevant for markets around the most recent quarterend the market saw simultaneous flows into the feds reverse repo facility alongside the first meaningful usage of the standing repo facility both of which we administer at the same time sponsored cleared repo volumes increased on the back of higher repo rates possibly signaling a transition from abundant to ample reserves in the system with potential implication for the pace of qt going forward the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 more broadly while markets have been constructive there are clearly risks and uncertainties ahead and so we constantly prepare and position for the many tail risks that exist from geopolitical tensions and conflicts to fiscal deficits and the impact of impending regulations and elections now referring to page of the financial highlights presentation as i said earlier bny delivered a strong financial performance in the third quarter with strong eps growth on the back of broadbased revenue growth and positive operating leverage reported earnings per share of were up yearoveryear and excluding notable items earnings per share of were up total revenue of billion increased by yearoveryear and reported expenses of billion were flat excluding the impact of notable items expenses were up yearoveryear as we continue to invest in our people and technology while we also generate greater efficiencies from running our company in new and better ways pretax margin and return on tangible common equity improved yearoveryear to and respectively for the first time in our history we reported over trillion of assets under custody andor administration at the end of the quarter now custody is not something we are but it is something important that we do this number one market position improves our unique vantage point as a global financial services company and it provides opportunity to drive value across our portfolio of adjacent businesses to deliver more of bny to our clients we increasingly see that the true power of bnys client franchise exists in the combination of capabilities across our leading securities services market and wealth services and investments and wealth businesses we have the ability to enhance this and to deliver more to our clients by bringing new innovative solutions to the market from across the seams of these businesses as an example we recently announced the planned acquisition of archer a leading technologyenabled service provider of managed account solutions to the asset and wealth management industry archer provides comprehensive technology and operational solutions that allow asset and wealth managers to access one of the fastestgrowing investment vehicles in the industry managed accounts at scale expanding distribution streamlining operations launching new investment products and delivering personalized outcomes for their clients the integration of archer should produce a positive impact

new client solutions across onebny we already have relationships with hundreds of alternatives managers as well as roughly trillion of wealth assets on our platforms we believe there is more the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 for us to do to mine the opportunity and build the technology to reach across our franchise and unlock the fast growing alternatives market for wealth intermediaries advisors and the investors they serve last month we introduced alts bridge a comprehensive data software and services solution built for wealth advisors alts bridge aims to make investing in alternatives easier for advisors through a streamlined endtoend experience and direct integration into advisors existing desktops starting with our pershing netx360 and wove platforms as we continue to deliver new innovative products we are also addressing the significant opportunity from enhancing our commercial model making it easier for clients to navigate bny in order to accomplish this we are promoting an enterprise approach to client coverage and we are operationalizing our new commercial model for example over the summer and for the first time in recent memory we brought together several hundred of bnys clientfacing commercial leaders from around the world as well as members of our executive committee for a twoday event we called commercial liftoff this program enabled our top client coverage people and their business partners to take a onebny view to account planning creating a shared vision for serving each of our clients holistically across the entire relationship generating new ideas to meet the clients objectives and developing actionoriented plans to deliver on those goals during the quarter we also made progress toward running our company better including the ongoing transition to a platforms operating model enhancing the connectivity across our teams and empowering our people to drive change across the company in september we went live with the next step on our multiyear plan to unite related capabilities around bny and elevate our execution by doing things in one place and doing them well we now have about or about onequarter of our people working in our new operating model as weve said before powering our onebny culture in order to be more for our clients and run our company better requires

by higher market values partially offset by the mix of aum flows and lower performance fees firmwide auca of trillion were up yearoveryear reflecting higher market values net new business and client inflows assets under management of trillion were up yearoveryear primarily reflecting higher market values and the favorable impact of a weaker dollar foreign exchange revenue increased by driven by higher volumes investment and other revenue was million in the quarter reflecting continued strength in fixed income and equity trading the yearoveryear increase primarily reflects a strategic equity

corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 turning to our business segments starting on page securities services reported total revenue of billion up yearoveryear total investment services fees were up yearoveryear in asset servicing investment services fees grew by primarily reflecting higher market values for the third quarter in a row the impact of repricing was de minimis etf auca of trillion was up more than yearonyear and the number of funds serviced was up yearonyear inflows into etfs on our platform remained strong this quarter with growth across all asset classes as the etf industry continues to grow we are dedicated to scaling our bestinclass etf service offering for example we have successfully onboarded several new liquidity providers to our electronic order execution platform to advance digital adoption in issuer services investment services fees were up net new business and higher client activity in corporate trust was partially offset by lower depositary receipts fees reflecting corporate actions in the prior year against the backdrop of increased issuance activity we continued to see strength in corporate trust capitalizing on our investments in people and technology to enhance client service and scalability in this segment foreign exchange revenue was up yearoveryear reflecting growth from newly onboarded clients as well as a higher level of client activity net interest income for the segment was up yearoveryear segment expenses of billion were down yearoveryear reflecting efficiency savings and lower severance expenses

behind us excluding the deconversion we saw approximately annualized net new asset growth in the third quarter wove continues to see strong client demand we signed up additional clients in the third quarter and we remain on track for the million to million of revenue in as we guided in january wove is helping us attract new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones for example pershing provides custody and clearing solutions for sanctuary a large and fastgrowing wealth manager servicing the highnetworth and ultra highnetworth segments sanctuary will also leverage wove portfolio solutions trading and rebalancing and reporting for teams that custody with pershing as well as those that use another custodian in clearance and collateral management investment services fees increased by primarily reflecting higher collateral management fees and higher clearance volumes against the backdrop of a growing market and active trading us securities clearance and settlement volumes have remained strong as you may remember we created our global clearing platform earlier this year through the realignment of pershing institutional solutions were pleased to see the pipeline of this platform continue to build for our full suite of institutional clearing settlement execution and financing solutions in over markets around the world the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 in treasury services investment services fees were up primarily reflecting net new business the business continues to execute well against the growth

ldi and active equity partially offset by net inflows into fixed income and we saw billion of net outflows from index strategies wealth management client assets of billion increased by yearoveryear reflecting higher market values and cumulative net inflows page shows the results of the other segment before i wrap up a couple of comments on the outlook for the year starting with net interest income remember we began the year setting up for positive operating leverage despite an expectation for fullyear net interest income to be down in while were currently forecasting for fourth quarter net interest income to be slightly below what we saw in our strong third quarter results the resilience of our net interest income over the first nine months of the year has positioned us to outperform our outlook for the fullyear net interest income growth rate from january by approximately five percentage points regarding expenses we continue to work hard to keep core expenses excluding notable items for the fullyear roughly flat we now expect our effective tax rate for the fullyear to be at the lower end of the to range we estimated in january and lastly as we said at the beginning of the year we expect to return or more of earnings to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks and we remain on track having returned of earnings year todate in conclusion our results this past quarter reflect broadbased growth across our three business segments and continued progress on our strategic priorities were pleased with the companys performance yeartodate and were proud of our people who continue to execute well toward our mediumterm financial targets while we all remain focused on the work and the tremendous opportunity ahead of us the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 with that operator can you please open the line for qa question and answer section operator operator instructions well take our first question from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank good morning thanks for taking my questions you flagged some of the etf wins that you had on the servicing side so curious about that number one how much of that was the blackrock business that youve won and has the revenue from that win that big win fully turned on or like is the fee rate lower because fees in asset servicing were up about but auc and i know sometimes the etf fee rates are a little lower so curious to flesh that out a bit thank you dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp thanks for the question i dont really want to get into the specifics on one client or transaction but just to take a step back on etfs generally it is a growing market you may have watched larry from blackrock on cnbc this morning it is a secular trend it is a very big and growing market and we are a key player in that as i said in my prepared remarks we have trillion on the platform thats up yearonyear and the number of funds serviced is up thats on the back of strong leadership and a real investment in technology so we can be bestinclass so without going into specifics were there to take advantage of the secular trend and well continue to innovate and solve for our clients needs brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank okay thanks for that maybe if i could word it a little differently the strong etf growth that you have seen this quarter is the revenue fully reflected this quarter or is some of those wins still have some revenue ramp to come dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp i would say its the latter its generally speaking strong pipeline were always adding new clients to the platform and because of the size of whats being onboarded they tend to do it in a phased approach so some revenue is on the platform some revenue to come brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank excellent thanks thanks for that dermot thank you also for the update on nii encouraging to see things working better could you speak to the deposit beta that you experienced with the first rate cut and given that were seeing rates coming down now is it reasonable to think that deposits could begin to grow from here dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 so the betas i think weve said on previous calls we view it as symmetrical so for us the first rate cut was passed on so we feel pretty good about that i think in terms of where we are in the fed easing cycle i think its probably a little bit too early to see how thats going to feed into the deposit balance story i think overall weve held in there we had a strong  for a variety of different reasons so i would say i expect where we are to moderate a little bit on balances in  and we will see what happens next with the next fed meeting but no significant change for us as we sit here right here today brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank great thank you for taking my questions operator operator instructions well move to our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi hey how are you doing robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp hey mike how are you mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc good thats a big number the trillion of auc a nice round number its factual that you beat expectations for the quarter and the year so far as you highlighted im just trying to figure out how much of this is lucky versus being smart and i imagine its a bit of both but the lucky part is record stock market volatility trading some other factors in the market that have gone your way and i dont feel like we have enough information on your client growth the underlying client growth the most repeatable part of the company so could you give some color on whether its growth in clients or maybe its revenues per client or maybe its products per client or all those adjacent businesses that you talk about how youre managing the company better versus simply a better environment to operate in robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure mike its robin i understand the question and its obviously a very legit question we broke through the trillion by the way we ended at trillion so the good news is we didnt stop at the round number id say that it isnt just fashionable its actually oldfashioned traditional just the way that we want to do it in terms of being able to have this deliberate growth and this focus and so weve tried to provide as much visibility as we reasonably can into the inputs of what it is thats ultimately driving this progress because we understand we have benefited from a terrific backdrop in terms of markets and of course its part of our business to be able to be wellpositioned to take advantage of those backdrops the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 weve got parts of our business which respond to asset values weve got parts of our business that respond to the number of accounts weve got parts of our business that respond to software sales transaction volumes and having that multifaceted set of business response functions if you want to call it that is actually a deliberate strategy so that we can participate in the growth of markets and so if you believe that overall debt issued in the world equity valuations in the world financial market activities are going to grow were trying to hitch our wagon to all of those growth trends we think thats good having said that to the heart of your question this is the work that weve really done in the early days since this management team took over which was to understand the components that we had and to really start to understand how they could work together so they could hum together in order to be able to unlock more potential and so we rallied to the firm around three strategic pillars this thing of being more for our clients and thats not just words its been about maturing this onebny philosophy that weve talked before about its about having a different type of dialogue its about the movement overtime to solutions as opposed to just products its like the examples that i gave and dermot gave in our prepared remarks where clients are coming to us because we can do more than one thing for them and its not just that were selling more things to them its that they actually want to take advantage of bundles of things which actually provide a better solution to their business and then our second pillar of running the company better thats been about sales rhythms and sales targets and bringing our people together and having them understand what it is that were trying to do and then wrapping the whole thing is this culture of wanting to have a winning culture wanting to push forward wanting to make bny of the future more than bny mellon was of the past and those things are all quite deliberate and we believe that were starting to see the results of that although its still early in our results but dermot can give you a couple of additional things on this which i think also would be helpful dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so mike from just thinking about it from a numbers perspective were up yearonyear in fee growth constructive markets and so weve been able to take advantage of constructive markets but a couple of important points that i would draw out is that in all three of our business segments weve seen solid underlying growth and in robins prepared remarks he talked about the fact that were evolving into a platform company and when we have platforms that were investing in at scale so when you have high volume and you have constructive markets we have the platforms in situ that can take advantage of that asset servicing were winning and onboarding new business we came into the year with a backlog we onboarded the business throughout the year and were beginning to go into the  with a bigger backlog than we came into the beginning of the year so asset servicing i feel very proud of corporate trust depositary receipts corporate trust specifically a good margin business but something that had been devoid of investment over a number of years and weve put money to work there in terms of leadership and scaling our technology and thats going to be an important business for us in the future and treasury services and clearance and collateral management have really shown when you have a scale platform with high volume strong markets lots of issuance lots of payments you take advantage of that the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 and then on just the clientspecific thing albeit its a small base weve highlighted a couple of transactions this year where were able to have a much more sophisticated conversation with clients and clients are now buying from us across more than one line of business in some cases four lines of business that was something that we just could not do a couple of years ago and robins point about bringing the onebny to bear on clients is really beginning to pay dividends mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right well that was very comprehensive just last followup are you implying and by the way on all the metrics again the client growth numbers are what and thanks for peeling back the layers of the onion there but always like even more layers never enough for us but in terms of growth in clients and more specifics going down the line but the expenses clearly dermot the flat expenses thats very clear on that part of it are you implying even lower expenses in the fourth quarter based on your new guide today dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so look the thing i would like to convey to you and to our shareholders is that we work really hard over the last couple of years to build credibility that we are good stewards of our expense base and we guided flat at the beginning of the year and broadly speaking theres been some pressure i would say on expenses that for the most part are revenue related and so if revenues are higher there are some aspects that you just have to pay more expenses so while ive guided roughly flat for the full year there may be a little bit of pressure over the course of that because of higher revenues and also as robin said in his remarks weve announced the acquisition of archer and there will be some integration costs associated with that but i feel very good the fact that now we have people who understand the importance of financial discipline and that goes to pillar number two of being a really wellrun company mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator well move to our next question from brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning folks thanks for taking my questions maybe just sticking with the revenue dynamic talking about the opportunity the commercial liftoff and the enterprise approach the early traction that youre getting i think you referenced some clients now doing multiple services can you talk a little bit more about how you think that might impact the revenue growth trajectory the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 and then also if you can reconfirm the general revenue delta to equity markets i think it was like equity market moves can have impact of about revenue so i wanted to sort of break apart those two dynamics really showing that youre actually generating this revenue growth aside from markets dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so if i take the last question first hopefully that was your two questions in one go so gradual change in equity markets is roughly million in fees annually and a gradual change in fixed income markets is roughly million in fees annually so thats a little bit on the sensitivity analysis and so on the commercial liftoff that robin talked about in his remarks it really is cathinka wahlstrom whos with us now for over a year spent the first year really on a listening tour and organizing roughly our to leading client coverage people around the world in terms of what we want our ambition to be what are the products that we have and how can we educate our total force to be able to be out there with clients delivering the whole of the firm i think and also if you talk about archer for a second i think a couple of years ago if we were to do that acquisition one part of the firm would have bought it for its business and i think robins point in his remarks are really really important where you buy it once you use it multiple times and its an acquisition thats done for the enterprise that will serve multiple lines of business and thats how you should think about how our client coverage model is going to work in a strategic way going forward were going to deliver holistic solutions for our clients clients have a better understanding of the diversified nature of our business franchise and theyre just buying more from us and its just going to show up in revenue and we feel very good about where we are today in terms of planning for the budget season for  and the opportunities that are going to come our way in brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thats helpful ill get back in the queue for another question actually operator well move to our next question from alex blostein with goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks good morning guys so maybe just wrapping some of the comments you made around fee and a bigger picture question when you guys think about a number of different growth areas you outlined some of the specifics and obviously the approach to crossselling has taken a whole different turn here so when you zoom out and you look at the business holistically how do you think about the organic fee growth that the enterprise can generate over time dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so we dont guide on fees i havent done dont intend to do it here but what i would say is and i gave this answer at an earlier question we are seeing underlying growth across all three of our business segments our underlying organic growth this year we feel quite happy about and we feel it reflects a really good nine months of the year and theres no reason to expect that that momentum wont continue the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 and i do feel the way weve set up for the back half of this year and into next year its a flywheel of innovation and we have a lot of growth initiatives and weve come together and we have a group of people who are working on what we call integrated solutions and so we have a number of interesting things in the pipeline robin talked about alts bridge in his remarks talked about archer in his remarks there are things that were doing within specific lines of business coming together we talked about pershing being realigned into clearance and collateral management and thats driving growth as well so the decisions that weve taken over the last couple of years in terms of realigning certain activities into different parts of the firm are showing up in our revenues this year and we will continue to do that into next year robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp and alex id just add dermot really alluded to this in what he just said but right from the beginning weve had two approaches one is to think about this endeavor of fully realizing bnys potential as a multiyear endeavor and we recognize that there are going to be different ways in which that will come together in different years and north star as you know for us is operating leverage and that came about in a slightly different way in than it did in and it could be different again in as we really get into that conversation ultimately when we talk to you in january but weve simultaneously invested in things that we knew would be important for the shorterterm and for the mediumterm and for the longerterm and so both dermot and i have talked about this platforms operating model thats a great example there have been some benefits that come early on in that process we brought like things together across the company there have been benefits on the revenue side there have been benefits on the expense side from doing it but then the value of having done it creates medium term momentum because now were able to be more dynamic for clients were able to solve problems more quickly for clients and so theres a payoff there and then over the longer term it actually makes it easier to be able to assemble these new solutions that dermot was just talking about and again theres a revenue story there but theres also an expense story and thats how were thinking about it notwithstanding we havent given you a specific growth target number make no mistake were invested in creating that growth alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah no fair enough i appreciate all that smaller kind of tactical question for you guys so the repo activity continued to be quite elevated and you mentioned that in your prepared remark as well is it possible to help size how much repo contributed across the enterprise it hits you in a couple of different ways obviously theres the nii benefit and theres some fee benefit so as you think about the more normalized level of repo activity versus what you saw in the quarter how big of a contributor was that in totality and as you look forward given changes in monetary policy expectations but also some of the client behavior that you mentioned earlier how sustainable do you ultimately think this more elevated pace of activity in this market dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 so on the repo question so a cleared repo for sure we saw elevated activity particularly going into the back end of the quarter and in the early part of this quarter and that in large part contributed to the outperformance for the  nii that has now moderated somewhat and so in my prepared remarks and in terms of the guidance thats why i kind of feel like roughly for nii were about a billion for the fourth quarter in terms of cleared repo overall as a kind of contributor to the nii over the course of the year its roughly about of the number as it relates to elevated activity in terms of volume and activity i think from what we see on our platforms we see that continuing to be the case in the medium term theres no reason for the slowdown its been a very strong year very very active client engagement product innovation and particularly on the international side we said at the beginning of the year in our strategic call in january that international was going to be a key area of focus on the platform and thats been the case and thats shown up in the results so i think overall and i said in my prepared remarks as well in terms of the liquidity ecosystem in total hit a high for us at trillion thats up from trillion a couple of years ago and thats in the backdrop of liquidity coming out of the system so weve grown quite substantially and that again is coming back to connecting the dots across the firm getting teams collaborating more being more digital providing innovative solutions to clients and that is really powering the growth robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp if i could just relate that back to a question that mike had asked earlier on because i think these things are relevant you got to remember that the strategy of us having roughly the right oars in roughly the right waters to be able to participate in things that are happening in the world thats very important so if i just supplement what dermot said with the additional observation that were the worlds largest securities lender that generates repo activity were the worlds largest collateral manager so we get to capture fees associated with people during repo we obviously play this role in the us treasury market which participates in the growth of us treasury repo we have all of these different touch points and so there are different ways in which we can collect across software in some cases services that we administer in others and participation in different both global markets and also product types which align in indirect ways to that so thats an important part of how we look at the overall system and understand how our products and services can help clients navigate those and we can participate in the benefit of that growth alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah thats a helpful framework to discuss it this way yeah thank you guys both operator well move to our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi dermot hi robin robin can you give us some thoughts with obviously you talked a little bit about the acquisition you accomplished in this quarter what your outlook is for youre obviously at very strong capital levels your stock has moved very nicely this year you got a better currency what the outlook is for just other types of acquisitions if there are some that could be complementary to what youre currently doing the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure gerard first of all just make a quick comment about archer were looking forward to closing that transaction in the fourth quarter and welcoming the team in and this relates a little bit to a couple of other things that weve already talked about on the call one is participation in markets and the other one earlier on on etfs if you just think about the way that we view the world construct once upon a time there were mutual funds more recently in the past decade or so its really been the explosion of etfs and theres a simultaneous thing going on which is the growth of separately managed accounts and so in the same way that dermot described how weve participated in outsized participation of the etf migration archer is a transaction that prepositions us to be able to participate hopefully in an outsized way associated with the transition to separately managed accounts so it relates to that strategic question of growth and participating in different markets that we talked about now stepping back to the other part of your question really the heart of it on ma now look our primary focus is what we have and how we can improve on it and dermot and i both talk a lot about the fact that weve looked very carefully at our businesses and we love our businesses we think we have a great set of businesses we think they are great ones to be in and we think that they have a lot of adjacency to each other and we think that the spread of those things can provide a lot more services to our clients and more joinedup way of solutions than maybe we have before so it isnt that we do ma from a position in any way of needing to do things its were able to be very opportunistic and we obviously like that a lot but notwithstanding that were pleased with what we have we dont want to be complacent so we keep our eyes open and we look at things and archer came about as a result of a strategic business review that we did internally looking at longterm trends looking at how we might adapt to those trends and then we went out and we looked very specifically for a capability that would do that with the key emphasis being on the word capability digestible bolton things that accelerate what were trying to do or derisk delivery of what were trying to do and if we can buy a piece of technology that can be more efficient or less distracting than building it ourselves with a great team great technology ideally like this one an installed book of business is also helpful then we feel very good about it as long as it aligns with those priorities is a good cultural fit has a good attractive return so thats our ma thought process and then if that fits into the overall waterfall which weve talked about before which is if we have excess capital were going to of course be prudent and so we like excess capital thats not a bad thing in an uncertain world and so thats a very important consideration then we look at whether or not we could invest it good news as you know were a pretty capitallight model were very capital generative so we dont need a ton of capital to reinvest in our business to keep growing it then we look at whether or not we need something for some type of additional need like the archer example and then we distribute the rest and this has been obviously a good year to see all of that on display weve been prudent weve run at elevated capital levels and as dermot has indicated we intend to return plus of net earnings to shareholders and weve been able to make an acquisition and so this is a pretty good model year for how we think about the world the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you for the answer and then just as a quick followup dermot you gave us that sensitivity analysis about a gradual change in the equity markets and fixed income and the impact it would have on revenue was that for up markets meaning the gradual increase was up does that also reflect a down market if markets were down thats the kind of impact we would expect to see dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp thats correct gerard thats correct gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay great thank you operator well move to our next question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i had a followup to some of your responses i think i guess depending how maybe starting with this capital allocation so heard your response to gerards question around ma and such but just talk to us when we think about the valuation of the stock on pricetoearnings pricetotangible book at the same time this year has been pretty good market backdropwise and as an investor shareholder you care about roe resiliency of these firms so one maybe robin dermot talk to us about your comfort around roe resiliency if the market backdrop is unfavorable whats the flex in the system and given where things stand today how do you think about the stock valuation versus the commitment to return 100plus in buybacks and dividends thank you robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp ill take the second bit first and then dermot will reflect on the first part of your question so the good news is that we can also pay attention to the way that you all think about the stock and your views of our stock and we appreciate the fact that many of you have expressed confidence in our forward direction we believe in ourselves as well and so while we do of course consider price as one of the many inputs into our capital return framework we dont view current prices as being problematic in terms of continuing our stock buybacks dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 ebrahim when i took on the role a couple of years ago i guess i got a lot of questions about is this just going to be more of the same or whats different and now were several quarters into the new team and robin has really bolstered that team and through the strategic pillars communication the principles the mediumterm financial targets has really started to evolve the culture of bny and so it is our commitment to deliver to our shareholders positive operating leverage through the cycle and so if you just take a step back and look at this quarters financials revenue growth flat expense growth pretax margin upper end of tier leverage return on tangible common equity and a eps growth and what i would say is a solid beat so i dont really think about the valuation of the firm on any given day we just care about delivering for our clients and our shareholders and if we do that in a firstclass way the valuation will take care of itself robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp and you asked about the returns and our sort of comfort with them look weve given mediumterm targets as dermot just said thats sort of greater than or equal to for rotce and so we obviously appreciate touching that but doing it consistently over time is how we really view achieving targets and in terms of the resiliency remember that the very nature of our business is actually got this diversification we talked about the equity market and the fixed income markets i talked about the fact that it is software its services platforms and market valuations and transaction volumes these are all that we participate in capital markets activity has been important to us in the fact that we participate through our corporate trust business through our debt capital markets business those are things that are participating in the growth of capital markets generally we participate in the scale of markets and things like the treasury market is a good example and so this diversification of our mix helps us to be resilient in terms of the vagaries of any one particular market or cycle now of course things will move around and thats why dermot mentioned the point about our commitment to positive operating leverage in almost all reasonable scenarios that we can imagine because we recognize that nii which is part of our mix but so too are the fees and then our ability to control our expenses we could make expenses less than they are now weve chosen to manage them at the level that they are because we believe that investing in that business for future growth is exactly what we should be doing right now given the environment but it wouldnt always have to be so ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc appreciate that and if i can sneak one quick more followup dermot i think you mentioned fourth quarter nii slightly lower than weve seen a few rate cuts in europe in the us now into september is it fair to assume that absent a dramatic change in rates this billion in quarterly nii is kind of where we are bouncing around at the bottom and then if deposit growth picks up qt stops that it should go off that base or am i missing something dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so if you look back at our last five quarters weve kind of toggled between billion and billion  was a stronger quarter for us for a number of reasons principally volatility in the market at the beginning of august and the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 clients held more cash and then towards the back end of the quarter once there was a clearer view on where the fed was going to go at rates clients started to put money into money market funds which ended up with us and so we kind of benefited from those two principal things and so our deposit balances have leveled off here we expect maybe nibs grind down a little bit from here and so as i said maybe minutes ago billion for  is the best guidance i can give you today and for i dont see nii being a headwind for us and weve taken extensive action over the last several weeks in terms of repositioning our cio book to insulate ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful thank you so much operator operator instructions we will move to our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good afternoon robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay two quick questions one is on the buyback question and i know you said youre very accretive earnings accretion you dont need a lot of capital for the business model of course as we know and youre above your target cet1 of and tier leverage target to youre at the highend of that range and so when we think about the plus how should we think about the plus part of the plus because it feels like totally makes sense but theres room to bring these to optimize the capital structure more im wondering what kind of timeframe are we talking about to optimize your capital structure do you feel dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so thanks for the question betsy last year we returned a little north of this year in january we guided or more given the uncertainty in the markets geopolitical the us presidential elections a wide range of uncertainty with fed in january we thought the year was going to be very different to where its ended up and i think on previous calls we said we wanted for now stick towards the upper end of our tier leverage ratio which is the range and so when you take that and the archer transaction we kind of think were still on track to do the or more through three quarters were at so i wouldnt expect that to materially change from here betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 okay got it and then the other question is you mentioned onethird of bny is now on the platform model and are you taking of the firm there and just wondering about implications for a runway for efficiency improvements as you execute on that thanks dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so a quarter of the firm roughly employees are on the platform now happened in two waves march and september with another wave going live in  of next year and so i wouldnt necessarily think about platforms operating model as a mechanism just for efficiency its going to drive topline growth and is going to run the company better and its going to help us have a different culture in terms of more joinedup thinking so it really is the mechanism by which we deliver the three strategic pillars and so the answer to the question about is yes and from here its probably another 18months before the firm is fully up there but by the end of  of next year we expect about half the firm will be live on the model and the feedback so far from our team around the world is extraordinarily positive so its really worked well for us as a firm robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp and betsy remember the tail of benefit extends way past the 18month point because sometimes its not until folks are in the model and operating in that new approach that theyre really able to examine some of the core questions that that platform is confronted with in terms of how to optimize so we expect the benefit that dermot was describing to be a multiyear endeavor past that 18month point betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it all right thanks so much appreciate it operator well move to our next question from glenn schorr with evercore isi glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hello just one wrapup for me dermot i love that you pointed out the revenue growth flattish expenses lead to earnings growth that is the power of the bk model if you look just i know its just one quarter but if you look at the sequential numbers the story changed a little bit with everything about flat and earnings down a little bit all im asking is does that inform us in any way of how were looking at as we roll into a lot of your business metrics and balance and client wins are up so my gut is its no but i just want to see from that perspective how you feel about that dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so i think your gut is correct it is no glenn and its all just about timing and when we onboard clients and put people on the platform and when the revenue starts to get recognized so just in terms of the backlog across all our businesses strong pipeline continues to grow and yeah so your intuition is correct the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc all right awesome thank you operator well move to our next question from rajiv bhatia with morningstar rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research yes just a quick one for me i guess on the depositary receipts business and i appreciate its a small business but the number of sponsored programs continues to decline is that something we should continue to expect to decline and is it competitive takeaways or something else thats driving that thanks dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so i wouldnt really read too much into that weve talked about that for several years about the sponsored program going away and not being around its still here depositary receipts is a small business in the totality of it but it is a very very important business for us because it gives us another opportunity to connect with clients and it has got a very good margin to it and we have very significant market share in that business so its something that we continue to invest in we think its very important for our franchise and we dont see a secular decline in that business from where we see it today robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp we also offboarded some of the smaller clients in that particular business so the headline of total number is a little bit misleading if you were able to dig under the hood and see some of the clients that made up that decline youd see that they disproportionately skewed to the small rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research got it thank you operator well move to our next question from jim mitchell with seaport global securities jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc my questions have all been asked and answered thanks operator operator instructions well move to our next question from brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks for taking my followup just one more on the margins youre mostly at your target in most areas so as you generate more saves from moving to the platform model and as we move into say next year or beyond i guess whats the view on spending some of that in investing in the business versus actually generating potentially generating margins well above the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so my answer to that one would be we want to demonstrate to you that we can prove that we can deliver margins through the cycle we gave guidance for the first time in january and then we just managed to get there pretty quickly but we want to stay there and show that we can deliver that over a period of time were heading into whats going to be quite an interesting budget season for us because weve done a lot of great things this year i know the various teams around the firm want to do great things next year and to offset that balance we want to be able to deliver positive operating leverage and so the next eight weeks and how we set up the firm for next year will inform how we communicate with you in january but we set out those targets because we believe we could hit them the positive is we got there earlier than we thought and now we want to show that we can improve and maintain those margins that weve guided to previously robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp and brian the best clue i could give you in terms of how we think about that in sort of a little bit more detail is if you actually look at us on a segmentbysegment basis you can see us prosecuting the operating leverage journey differently in our three segments and we told you a year or so ago that thats what we were going to do and so maybe to allay your concerns in terms of growth and investment if you look at market and wealth services we arent trying to grow the margin there were very happy with the margin we just wanted to grow the total size of the business which is exactly what weve been doing there are the other segments where we said we actually do want to grow the margin towards our mediumterm targets for those segments there we are really growing the margin and so you can see exactly your question at work in our segments brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yes thats great color thank you very much operator and for our final question well return to the line of mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi with all this talk of the transitioning of the employees i guess half the employees to the new platform over the next one to two years how much do you see ai playing a role and can you give any metrics i mean keeping expenses flat i dont know how much youre still investing in ai when emily presented at the boston bank conference last november it seemed like bny was all in for ai it was one of the most bullish cases made yet youve heard out in the broader world sometimes you have hits sometimes you have misses so where how does ai relate to the whole platform strategy and how committed are you to ai and do you have any numbers that you can give us some concrete metrics thanks robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 11oct2024 sure so just to reiterate weve got a quarter of our people in the platforms operating model and as dermot said its sort of an 18month trajectory from here thats really mike the way i think about platforms operating model is this concept of if you take it that we are in fact more and more a platforms company in terms of these large atscale capabilities often software and services that we deliver generally in marketleading positions number one in a variety of different markets weve talked about things the businesses before i wont repeat them then it follows to us from that that it makes sense for us to operate ourselves in a platforms operating model which is the way that many other platform companies in the world operate themselves and so that is a strategy around how we organize ourselves in being pursuant to our broader strategy now ai which is of course part of that we have an ai hub we have a couple of hundred people in that ai hub and we are absolutely investing in ai and do believe in the power of ai to be able to help our business in terms of both revenue opportunities over time for clients and also ways to make our people more effective and efficient and we havent made a lot of noise about it but dont misunderstand that for a lack of interest or investment because we havent slowed down in fact weve increased our ai investment and of course notwithstanding all of that you can see that from running the company well on an expense line were not allowing that enthusiasm to distract us from the important task of expense management and this is where i dont mean to be pithy but its very very important learning for us is that we as a company can walk and chew gum at the same time we can invest in things that matter and we can manage the company well we make choices and ai is a choice of something were leaning into and we think thats important for the future mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you robin antony vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you operator and with that that does conclude our questionandanswer session for today i would now like to turn the call back over to robin for any additional or closing remarks robin antony vince president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you operator and thanks everyone for your time today we appreciate your interest in bny please reach out to marius and the ir team if you have any followup questions be well operator thank you this does conclude todays conference and webcast a replay of this conference call and webcast will be available
