financial results and shell give you the outlook for the remainder of the year in more detail as well our financial performance this quarter reflects healthy and broadbased organic growth across our businesses as well as the supportive global markets backdrop now if you refer to slide of our financial highlights presentation we reported eps of and generated a return on tangible common equity of revenue was billion up yearoveryear and fee revenue was up yearoveryear and that would have been if you excluded the impact of money market fee waivers this fee growth included almost of organic growth across our franchise during the quarter we returned roughly billion of capital to our shareholders including almost million of common dividends and billion of buybacks our continued focus on innovation has led us to announce several groundbreaking new solutions this quarter that will meaningfully improve the client experience and represent exciting growth opportunities for us let me start with asset servicing in the third quarter we continued to see strong sales momentum yeartodate wins are up almost versus a year ago and we are winning larger more complex deals that span our product offering as clients increasingly see the value we can provide across the value chain we had a number of exciting business wins this quarter but one example id like to highlight is the work were doing for oak hill advisors a leading alternatives investment firm oak hill was receiving fund admin services from one of our competitors and performing middle office functions in house due to our deep expertise and our ability to offer them a seamless solution across multiple services we were able to win both mandates this mandate is a real testament to our differentiated capabilities and the strength of our alternatives servicing platform which is seeing very nice fee growth this year of plus and we remain excited about our ability to scale this business and the growth opportunity for us ahead of us we also continue to see good momentum in etf servicing where yeartodate we have already helped clients launch more funds than during all of and then in our data and analytics business our capabilities continue to resonate with our clients this quarter we signed two additional large asset manager clients to our next generation data management platform or what we call the data vault and another large global asset manager went live bringing the total number of clients signed up or mandated to the vault to six and were also thrilled about an extension of our partnership with the florida state board of administration as they look to leverage our esg data analytics app into their full investment cycle for 30plus funds spanning about billion in assets under management now moving on to markets and wealth infrastructure businesses pershing had another good quarter and it was on the back of continued organic growth in accounts and new client assets over the last months pershing the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 generated over billion of new assets despite the headwind of the few clients lost to consolidation that we previously mentioned to give you just one example of our differentiated capabilities and the power of our broader interconnected franchise a multibilliondollar wealth management client recently approached pershing for a strategic partner that can provide a broad set of integrated solutions in a collaboration between our investment management our wealth management and pershing businesses we designed a series of riskbased models and turnkey investment solutions that are more costeffective taxefficient and portable for the end investors this innovative solution combined with our leading custodial services and technology made pershing the provider of choice but were not resting there this past week we announced the launch of a new business unit within pershing which were calling pershing x this unit will deliver the industrys leading endtoend platform in the wealth advisory space offering a comprehensive set of advisory capabilities and helping financial services firms solve the challenge of managing multiple and disconnected technology tools and data sets for their advisors fueling our clients and therefore our growth today were already the leading provider of custody and clearing services and by adding frontend capabilities pershing will become uniquely well positioned with rias in the broader wealth tech segment to capture share in one of the fastestgrowing segments in financial services im also thrilled to welcome ainslie simmonds to bny mellon who will lead this effort for us ainslie has been a transformative leader in the advisory space for years she has extensive experience across wealth management and digital and she has helped launch several successful fintechs pershing x is one of our most ambitious multiyear projects todate the combination of our planned investments and the talent that weve recruited combined with the leading platform that we already have will meaningfully enhance pershings future growth profile in treasury services we continue to see healthy growth in payment volumes on the back of an improving global economy and net new business in september we announced that verizon has become the first corporate client to roll out bny mellons innovative realtime ebills and payments functionality to its customers now weve spoken about this a few times about the capability in the past and were just incredibly excited about its future we see enormous opportunity across our client roster as more retail banks enable their customers to receive and pay ebills via the realtime payments network as some of you have seen ceos from of the largest banks in the country including myself signed a letter committing to bring these capabilities to the market and we expect that of digitally enabled us consumer accounts will eventually have this functionality by year end with over billion bills paid annually within the us many of which are still paperbased this ecosystem is ripe for disruption which our innovative capability is built to address at scale and we are uniquely positioned in the market as we dont compete with other banks in consumer banking or card issuing as a result of our leadership in the space we were recently recognized by the banker as the best transaction bank in payments its a real honor and we think its just the beginning so a lot more to come in the space turning to clearing and collateral management the business continues to benefit from the higher collateral management balances in fact they reached a record trillion at one point this quarter outside the us we are the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 seeing growth as clients continue to migrate from bilateral to triparty and domestically recent growth has been driven by the elevated utilization of the feds reverse repo facility where we are the sole clearer globally we continue to implement new capabilities that allow clients to more efficiently mobilize collateral interoperability between our us and international platforms and vice versa as part of our future of collateral program additionally this quarter we were the first bank to add agency mbs as collateral on overnight cleared repo transactions and these are done via the fixed income clearing corporations new general collateral sponsored repo program this new capability expands the universe of clients that now can indirectly transact with central counterparties as well as the scope of eligible collateral and by sponsoring these transactions we help our clients reduce costs and free up capital that could not otherwise be available on a bilateral basis last but not least the recent deadlines for the phase of noncleared margin rules really differentiated us in the market and has validated the multiyear investments weve been making in automation and client experience while many across the industry really struggled and were ultimately unable to repaper all their counterparty relationships in time to go to meet these golive deadlines at the end of september bny mellon was lauded for having a more streamlined process for client onboarding experience and for having digitized and automated the collateral schedule negotiation and amendment process once again our automation has enabled our clients to do things better faster and cheaper in markets client volumes remain very strong on the back of continued organic growth offsetting the headwind of lower volatility this quarter we also rolled out several enhancements to our liquiditydirect platform that gives clients additional shortterm investment options clients can now seamlessly invest their cash in commercial paper and ultrashort duration fixed income etfs and also now have the ability to select money market funds based on their esg investing criteria and preferences leveraging our esg data analytics app while still early days client feedback so far has been extremely positive pivoting to our investment and wealth management business in investment management we saw our sixth consecutive quarter of net inflows into longterm products and our initial suite of eight index etfs including the industrys first true zero fee etfs in the largest equity and fixed income etf categories now exceeds billion of aum and is growing quickly and we recently launched our first active etf the bny mellon ultra short income etf subadvised by dreyfus on the 1st of september we successfully completed the transition of almost billion of mellons aum and over client mandates into insight and newton as well as the integration of mellons cash capabilities with dreyfus to drive further investment specialization at scale this realignment positions us to better meet clients needs it creates greater scale and it enhances the differentiation in the value proposition of our investment firms not only are we pleased with the timely completion of this project but the feedback from clients and consultants has been very encouraging and we have experienced virtually no client attrition during this transition and finally in wealth management the business continues to execute on its clear threepronged strategy to focus on client acquisition expand the investment and banking offering and invest in technology to drive efficiency yeartodate weve acquired about more clients than over the same time period last year and the average size of our new clients is up by over the business saw another strong quarter of net inflows and continued growth across lending and deposit products and our investment performance remains strong the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 and so in summary were intensely focused on driving innovation across the franchise in fact we were recently named among fast companys best workplaces for innovators a testament to our forwardthinking culture and our continued investments in our people technology efficiency and growth were pleased with the continued pickup in organic growth and were continuing to make the investments necessary to drive further growth and efficiency so with that ill hand it over to emily emily h portney chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thank you todd and good morning everyone as i walk you through the details of our results for the quarter all comparisons will be on a yearoveryear basis unless i specify otherwise starting on page total revenues grew by reflecting higher fee revenue partially offset by lower net interest revenue and higher money market fee waivers fee revenue grew by or excluding the impact of fee waivers this reflects the positive impact of higher market values strong organic growth and the favorable impact of a weaker us dollar money market fee waivers net of distribution and servicing expense were million in the quarter an improvement of million compared to the prior quarter driven by slightly higher average shortterm interest rates other revenue was million and included roughly million of valuation gains on strategic equity investments net interest revenue was down expenses increased or excluding the impact of higher litigation reserves a notable item this quarter the impact on which you can see at the bottom of the slide provision for credit losses was a benefit of million primarily driven by an improved macroeconomic forecast including an expectation for a continued recovery of commercial real estate prices eps was higher litigation reserves negatively impact eps by and provision benefit had a positive impact this quarter pretax margin was on page we see the trend across a few key metrics over time on to capital and liquidity on page our capital and liquidity ratios remained strong and well above regulatory minimums and above our internal targets our tier leverage ratio which is our binding constraint was down approximately basis points sequentially primarily driven by the return of billion of capital to our shareholders partially offset by earnings and a quarteroverquarter reduction in average assets we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of down basis points compared to the end of the second quarter finally our lcr was roughly flat compared to the prior quarter turning to page and further details on net interest revenue nir for the third quarter was million down less than sequentially the impact of lower interestearning assets and continued pressure on reinvestment yields was partially offset by lower premium amortization the benefit of a full quarter of higher ioer and lower deposit and funding the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 turning to page for some color on our balance sheet average deposit balances declined by or approximately billion sequentially this is as we continue to work with our clients to pursue off balance sheet alternatives for their excess cash this decrease in deposits drove an approximately equal sized reduction of our average cash held at central banks the size of our securities portfolio remained flat quarteroverquarter average loans increased by about sequentially and yearoveryear with growth primarily driven by margin loans secured loans to global financial institutions collateralized loans in wealth management and growth in capital call financing turning to page as i mentioned earlier expenses of billion were up yearonyear excluding the impact of the notable items that i also mentioned earlier expenses were up almost twothirds of this increase was attributable to revenuerelated expenses and the remainder was evenly split between incremental investments and the unfavorable impact of the weaker us dollar on to page for a closer look at our businesses investment services reported total revenue of billion up yearonyear on higher fees partially offset by lower net interest revenue and higher fee waivers excluding the impact of fee waivers fee and other revenue was up assets under custody andor administration increased by to trillion roughly half driven by growth from new and existing clients and half driven by higher market value as i discuss the individual investment services and businesses ill focus my comments on the fee revenue for each business in asset servicing we saw strong growth despite the impact of fee waivers thats on the back of higher market values and client activity as well as higher fx revenue fee waivers impacted growth by roughly basis points in pershing fees were also up nicely reflecting higher market values and continued underlying organic growth offsetting the impact of lost business and waivers the waivers impacted fee growth by approximately basis points in pershing clearing accounts were up and mutual fund assets were up net new assets in the quarter were up billion excluding the impact of the deconversion of clients lost to consolidation that we have discussed previously net new assets in the quarter would have been roughly in line with the second quarter in issuer services fees were down and included a roughly 600basispoint impact on fee growth from waivers the resumption of issuance activity and seasonally higher dividend payments in dr were offset by a decline in corporate trust fees in treasury services healthy fee growth on the back of improved economic activity and net new business resulting in higher payment volumes was offset by approximately basis points from fee waivers lastly clearance and collateral management fees were up primarily driven by growth in nonus collateral management balances and higher clearance volumes partially offset by lower intraday credit fees fx revenue across all investment services increased by driven by higher client volumes as were winning new business and growing with existing clients this was partially offset by lower volatility and spreads the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 page summarizes the key drivers underneath the yearoveryear revenue story for each of our investment services businesses now turning to investment and wealth management on page investment and wealth management reported total revenue of billion up yearoveryear primarily driven by higher market values valuation gains on strategic equity investments the benefit of the weaker us dollar and increased performance fees all partially offset by higher fee waivers excluding the impact of fee waivers fees and other revenue was up assets under management grew to trillion up yearoveryear reflecting higher market values client inflows and the favorable impact of the weaker us dollar principally versus the british pound in the third quarter net inflows totaled billion driven by ldi and cash strategies as todd highlighted the business has now seen its sixth consecutive quarter of net inflows into longterm products investment management revenue grew primarily driven by higher market values equity income and gains on strategic equity investments the benefit of the weaker us dollar and higher performance fees fee waivers negatively impacted revenue growth by basis points wealth management grew by primarily driven by higher market value client assets reached billion up yearonyear page shows the results of the other segment ill conclude with a few remarks about the outlook for the remainder of the year our guidance on nir based on the current forward curve remains down compared to also using the forward curve we expect fee waivers in the fourth quarter to be roughly in line with the third quarter with regard to fees excluding waivers given growth in the third quarter exceeded our expectations and given the continued momentum across the franchise we now expect fees exwaivers for the fullyear to be up closer to on expenses we continue to expect the fullyear to be up about excluding notable items and we also expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately and then lastly with regards to buyback given we ended the quarter basis points above our management target for tier leverage the fact that we continue to have excess deposits that we expect to recede over time and based on our expectation for continued strong capital generation we intend to once again return capital well in excess of of earnings to our shareholders in the fourth quarter with that operator can you please open the line for questions the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 question and answer section operator yes operator instructions our first question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning todd good morning emily thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning steven emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc wanted to start things off with just a question on the nir guidance emily that you just gave i was hoping just to unpack the guide for specifically what youre assuming in terms of deposit and balance sheet growth liquidity redeployment and i guess last and certainly not least premium amortization emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so why dont we first just start with the third quarter in the third quarter nir was down very very modestly that was off the back of lower reinvestment yields also lower interestearning assets as we worked with our clients to actually manage especially excess deposits we were able to offset that with some tweaks in the securities portfolio and also we did see a benefit from premium amortization coming down that was both a mixture of us reducing the size of our mbs portfolio as well as the fact that prepayment speeds did slow down quartertoquarter our fullyear guide as you just rightfully pointed out remains at down for the full year in terms of kind of whats baked into the fourth quarter look i think we have more or less hit the trough whats baked in there certainly well still have the impact of lower reinvestment yields as a headwind we are expecting a further reduction in interestearning assets because we will continue to work with our clients in terms of managing excess deposits so perhaps we expect them to go down by about billion to billion with respect to premium amortization its likely our expectation or forecast based on rates is that it will be pretty much flat fourth quarter to third quarter and look there is probably some upside i mean certainly based on what were seeing in terms of volatility in rates and even some movements like for example the bank of england et cetera so there could be some upside the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no thats great color emily and just for a followup on expenses i was hoping you could speak to the expense growth outlook weve seen a number of upward revisions to the expense guidance over the course of the year and just want to gauge whether the current level of expense its about billion ex the litigation cost is the right jumping off point for and maybe just longer term what level of expense inflation we should be underwriting on a more normal basis just given the continued investments you cited in the business emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so within the quarter so yes expenses overall up were still guiding for the fullyear expenses to be up versus last year obviously ex notables when you unpack the third quarter about twothirds of that is attributable to what we call revenuerelated expenses inclusive of an uptick in higher incentives we obviously want to pay our people competitively and for the strong organic growth that we are seeing about a third of that is split evenly between the impact of the weaker us dollar as well as the incremental investments that we have pulled forward so those are the investments in both in growth in infrastructure as well as efficiency its worth mentioning that in the third quarter we are starting to see an impact of a tighter labor market both in terms of competition and in terms of costs and also in the third quarter there was an impact of a merit increase which took effect in june as we kind of look out its certainly too early to really comment on were in the middle of the planning process what i would say is that yes the uptick youre seeing in the second half of the year is really the jumping off point for next year and ultimately there are other headwinds as well inflation as i just mentioned look were seeing its a good thing but return to more normalized travel rates so te is likely to go up and as we reopen the offices and return to the office therell be some additional expenses associated with that of course we will continue to also achieve and identify efficiencies were working through the investment spend as we speak going to the proverbial food fight because as always theres lots that we want to do but what i would say is were intensely focused on expense management we will continue to be focused on expense management but were also going to invest through the cycle and if i were to just give some color i would just say that expenses in if im standing here today will be modestly up from steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful color emily thanks so much for taking my questions operator our next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi well this is a good timing because i wanted to follow up on the food fight investment spend discussion so software costs were up yearoveryear and todd you started off talking about some fintechlike initiatives and so im just wondering if maybe next year you want to spend more money i mean there is this tough trade off that you have in delivering results and investing for what you think could be a good effort i didnt fully understand when you were talking about pershing and the transaction banking payments so maybe if you could the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 just describe the total addressable market for that how much you have and where you think youre getting or some color around that and then what type of spending thats going to involve thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay so pershing x is i think an exciting opportunity for us and so if you think about the registered investment advisor business so if you think about pershing were really the largest correspondent clearer so were a thirdparty clearer for broker dealers in the retail space and now registered investment advisor and that business is actually growing but its not growing nearly as fast as the advisory space is growing and so we are the custodian we are the clearer we are providing a lot of the backend services for that business but we think theres the opportunity for us to be an integrator in that business so and its been growing i havent looked at the number recently but its been growing at a ballpark of so we think that and weve got a relatively small market share for it mike so we think theres an opportunity for us to pick up market share in a fastgrowing segment so thats why its so exciting to us in terms of the challenge that pershing x will solve if you think about it advisors have these multiple technology tools a bunch of different data sets that theyre trying to integrate or trying to look at oftentimes theyre logging into multiple systems and theyre really reducing the advisory productivity and that would be across things like financial planning investment modeling even some banking activities and we have the ability to integrate our own private bank so theres really no solution out there today that can tie that all together and so thats what we mean it will be an open architected but an endtoend solution so well be integrating bestinclass services amongst some of our own and itll provide a digital capability and real good retail experience both to the advisor as well as to the investor itself so thats our target for pershing i think your other question was around the epayments so in epayments this is we this is using the clearing houses real time payments system and we were the first to actually connect and now this is a request for payment from a client excuse me our clients so verizon to their customer and they send come across your theyll come across your phone that your bill is ready here is your bill press this and make the payment in realtime or you can even you can set a time when you want to make that payment to make sure that youve got funds in your account that will connect as more and more banks connect to the realtime payments system that broadens the capability of covering a very large percentage of the market currently there are about billion payments made in the us so its an enormous market and weve got some weve got about prospects showing significant interest in the capability we designed mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so epayments big initiative big opportunity pershing x if i heard you correctly big market big opportunity so in terms of funding these initiatives as far as investing in these areas specifically or more generally i know youve done a lot of overhaul in the back office a lot of overhaul with your tech talent what sort of spending will this take and should you be going faster or slower or how do you decide that the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i mean we so as you know weve been increasing our tech spend over the past few years a lot of that as you pointed out was in infrastructure and resiliency and building a sounder infrastructure to support the growth that were looking to drive today and so its kind of the peace dividend from that we are reinvesting in a number of the in software and the app dev that weve talked about so i kind of categorize it into three areas one is weve talked about our initiatives i mean we just talked on two pershing and treasury but weve got some very neat things going on in our data and analytics capability were digitizing things across the bank the wealth platform we continue to invest in for our own wealth management activity corporate trust were using smart contracts and developing a digital network for our clients to operate on and investment management were so just about across our businesses we continue to invest invest in technology theres also ongoing infrastructure and risk management i mean our cyber defenses are not cheap and we need to continue to invest in them were doing a significant number of cloud conversions as i think through across the company regulatory reporting requirements continue to go up theres a liquidity requirement as well as complying with the libor requirements and we will always be focused on data and resiliency and then on the efficiency side theres weve actually inventoried the number of things that we do manually and were looking to knock them out for automating when it can create some significant efficiencies and risk reduction and were also looking to modernize some of our core apps so even in our treasury services were putting a very modern payments app engine underneath all of this so there are a lot of the good news is there are a lot of opportunities but it will come with some costs and our intent is to increase our technology spend next year mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning todd good morning emily thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning gerard emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 todd can you or emily when i go back to the yearend prepandemic size of your balance sheet you guys had assets about billion and deposits of billion lets call it and then you had deposits at the fed of billion obviously today its considerably higher when the fed finishes quantitative easing assuming its finished by next summer can you kind of frame out for us what you think your balance sheet might look like as we go forward are customers going to be pulling deposits out do you think it will shrink down not that youll ever get to that yearend level but should we start to think about a continued falling on the size of the balance sheet emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp im happy to take that and todd certainly can chime in so the way we think about deposit levels now we probably still have around to of our deposits are excess and they will eventually recede in a more normalized rate environment but actually core deposits overall are also up just given the growth in auca et cetera so i mean the core deposits are also up but the excess is about to and the way weve been looking at it is certainly weve been kind of managing the growth in those deposits and very successfully so so kind of very in a targeted way looking at what we deem to be excess and working with our clients to pursue off balance sheet alternatives for those particular balances and as the fed begins to taper and we all think they will begin to taper soon i think that does help in terms of kind of putting a lid to a degree on the growth of deposits from here in terms of kind of what we expect kind of in i guess kind of and beyond yes i think that youre at a stage where the fed actually hikes on multiple occasions its kind of only at that point that we would probably see a decline in deposits but the core itself is higher than it was in the fourth quarter of thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp and gerard i think if my memory serves me right gerard that date was you were picking an end date it was actually the averages were a little bit lower than that so there is a significant amount of excess it will start to and thats why were sitting on so much cash at central banks and well probably see a little less pressure certainly for deposit growth when the fed starts to taper but to emilys point the excess coming off is probably sometime thereafter gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc correct they were periodend numbers good memory the followup question you guys had a very robust share repurchase amount this quarter as emily pointed out of billion and just guided for the fourth quarter the question is if i recall correctly you have a billion program that i think expires at the end of next year if you reach the billion prior to the termination date would you consider reupping assuming of course your capital ratios permitted would you consider reupping the buyback if you use it all up before that termination date thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp the answer gerard and if you think about the stress capital buffer regime has actually made things a little more flexible for us and so certainly the board recognizes that if we continue to produce the capital that were likely to and we buy back the excess capital that weve accumulated well be in a position to come back to them and ask for more so the answer is yes the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of jim mitchell with seaport research jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe just one on issuer service fees they were flat sequentially and typically youd have some seasonality i think you mentioned some weakness in on the corporate trust side is that just pushed out should we expect some rebound in just how do we think about the trajectory in that business and any more detail on the quarter would be great emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so in the issuer services you really do have two businesses depositary receipts and corporate trust as you point out within dr we definitely saw a resumption in both issuance and dividend activity and that was really even on top of the normal uptick that we see in the third quarter in corporate trust the underlying business actually is performing really well volumes in structured products are up actually meaningfully slightly offsetting a small decline in activity in munis but the third quarter for corporate trust there were really things that also impacted revenue so one was a decline in reimbursable expenses weve got reimbursable expenses that are just a passthrough and ultimately so that impacts revenue does not have any impact whatsoever on pti and also there was a discontinuation of a public sector mandate that started in this quarter and youll well see the full effect of that in the next in the fourth quarter will probably be another million or so decline jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay and but no nothing got pushed into it just was those issues emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay and just maybe on the payments business i think its kind of an interesting push youve already had some growth in treasury services so maybe you could just talk a little bit of whats been driving the accelerating growth of late i think its a little too early to be expecting anything from these new initiatives and then i guess as we think about the new initiatives like this verizon deal and others potentially is that a firstmover advantage type thing i guess how do you defend being the intermediary between the merchants and the banks is it just simply being the firstmover advantage so and what you think the possibility from a revenue standpoint could be from that business thanks the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i mean this is so a couple of things there so effectively what were doing is were digitizing their collection experience so weve been in the lock box business and now were converting that to electronic to these requests for payments and it is faster and cheaper for the provider so the cost actually is for the utility in this case so the cost to them on a perunit basis is down dramatically and you also reduce float and other items so we think its usually to their advantage so we happen to have the collection relationship and we can continue the paper is not going away thats going to be a component of it so we can provide the complete solution so we just thought we happen to be in a very nice position to do this and were not in the card or retail payments business to speak of in between it so we happen to be very well positioned and we got a little bit of a firstmover advantage by being into the clearing houses real time payments system right away in terms of how big can this grow it could possibly move the needle a little bit and add a little something to our organic growth i think its a little too early to tell were excited about the relationship that weve got with verizon were excited that this certainly stirred up a lot of interest and weve got a pretty reasonable pipeline but i just prefer at this point not to speculate on what that could be perhaps jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay yeah thanks operator our next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions would like to explore the really robust core fee revenue growth that you guys have seen here todd you made reference to a nearly organic growth rate in the quarter which is really quite good so is it possible to break down the yeartodate or your expectations for in the different components how much of it came you think from organic how much activity and volume related i seem to recall that in the past youve said that half of your servicing business is marketsensitive so is that still the right way to calibrate when we think about the market impact or pricing dynamics is it possible to give some color around the composition thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure sure brennan so i think first of all we should probably help you understand what were describing as organic so we do try to take the market impact out for interest rates and the equity markets we also try to adjust for example for some of the unusual activity that came for example right now money market funds are very large because of all this excess cash deposits are very large because of this excess cash so we try to knock that growth out of the calculation and when we knock all of that out because if you look at us growing our revenue growth minus fee waivers is significantly higher than what were talking about in terms of our organic growth because thats getting the benefit of some of the market considerations the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 so once you knock all of that out the numbers get to something like or so for this year which is much stronger than what weve seen in years past and frankly three years ago it was probably zero maybe even slightly negative emily you want to kind of march through some of the areas where were actually seeing it emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp in organic growth sure i mean the and just to really break it down very clearly so the in fee growth ex waivers we saw this quarter yearonyear was organic growth as todd alluded to about of that was just market was market impact and the remainder was just impact of a weaker us dollar in terms of the organic growth in that it was really broadbased so when you look at pershing i think we talked a bit about continued growth in clearing accounts mutual fund balances and net new assets in terms of treasury services we saw good growth in terms of payment activity and on the back of both stronger economic a stronger macroeconomic backdrop but also net new business and also within treasury services weve really shifted the product mix to be higher margin in that business in asset servicing wins are up yeartodate versus what they were last year so that too is just speaking to the organic growth in that business in fx volumes were up significantly and some of thats market but a lot of that too is just based on investments in the fx platform that weve made so its really broadbased and strong brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc excellent thank you for all that color and emily id like to explore some of your i know its very early to talk about but the expectation around expenses next year a few questions on that would that modest growth be on a constant currency basis and when we calibrate i think you also had said that the back half of is a decent base in which to build off of is that excluding the litigation that you guys had and if so could you size that for us and when we think about modest is there any way to calibrate that like would you consider the expense growth to be modest or is it a bit more significant than that thanks emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so in terms of its a bit early to really comment on were obviously going through the entire planning process as we speak as i did mention earlier the uplift in expenses that youre seeing in the second half of this year on the back of the investments that we are making is structural so those are permanent and that really will be baked into next year as i also mentioned there are some headwinds were starting to see a bit of inflationary pressure like i said were going to return to more kind of normalized we think travel and so te will likely go up a bit of extra expense associated with return to the office so there are headwinds that of course were going to be looking to offset with efficiencies so i wouldnt want to put an actual number on it but at this moment i would say expenses for the fullyear next year will be modestly up and thats just on a top line basis they will be modestly up versus this year thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 and brennan we would adjust for the litigation reserves so we would consider that part of the base emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah on a nonoperating sic an operating basis i should have said that sorry brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc got it and i know fx should fx be a tailwind for you guys next year just to followup on that because i know it was a headwind this year thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp it depends on emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp it depends thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp where we go out right now the dollar is showing a little bit of strength which would create an expense tailwind but it would be neutral to our pretax brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc right fair enough thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hi good morning i wanted to start by just asking you to talk a little bit more about asset servicing it had really good underlying growth if we just keep sec lending aside and fee waivers aside and the deck mentions transaction activity and higher market levels im just wondering if you can help us understand like how did the collateral business act versus how did the core asset servicing act and what type of a net new wins quarter did you see on both sides thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so emily why dont i take the clearing and collateral management business and you can take the rest of the asset servicing space so we saw good growth in the clearing and collateral management business as we have for a while now in fact one of the points i made in my remarks for the first time we saw the collateral management numbers our triparty numbers exceed trillion in the quarter so we continue to see good growth the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 there and the profitability on the global collateral management continues to be strong weve got innovation that is paying off there so that attributed a bit to the growth the other thing that were doing and we do this out of our markets business but its really a collateral management business is the requirement to meet margining for overthecounterderivatives transactions to meet margin requirements and were in phase of of that and our teams did an excellent job of seamlessly onboarding a significant number of players and thats starting to add a little bit of revenue to the line there so overall that business continues to look pretty healthy and continues to show underlying organic growth you want to comment on the rest of asset servicing emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure as you think about asset servicing and just thinking about just the growth in our fees or sorry our auc our assets under custody they are up about yearonyear on a spot basis about half of that was driven by market and the other half truly driven by growth both from growth from existing clients as well as new clients probably split about and when just thinking through kind of where were seeing a lot of that growth about of it is from investment managers another or so is from brokerdealers and banks and then the remainder is really split between both the alternative space and the asset owner space so thats were seeing a nice uptick in the pipeline its stronger than it was in this period last year ken usdin q analyst jefferies company great thank you and my followup is just coming back on the clearing business last quarter you had said that you had expected about a million impact from the deconsolidation that you discussed can you just help us understand how much of that was already out in the third quarter and how much more do you still expect if any emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure in pershing we had originally expected about a million impact of the lost business due to just being on the wrong side of ma that is due to timing that was a lot less so i would think about it as the uptick will be about million between the third quarter and the fourth quarter well see the full impact ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay got it understood all right thank you operator our next question comes from the line of brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks very much good morning folks most of my questions have been asked but maybe just to follow on on a couple so just going back on to the organic growth obviously this is really tracking well going from zeroish to now close to so maybe just a thought i know is too early but given these initiatives that you have and how you think about the revenue following through do you are you optimistic that you can continue to improve upon that number the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 and then just one on pershing x just in that aggregator system does that require you to disintermediate that current custodian or are you becoming the custodian in that process or rather would you sit on top of the current custodian and make it have a seamless aggregation of their technology services thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay so why dont i take the pershing question and then emily i think you can probably handle the other one but the pershing project x will be multicustodial so it will be actually be custodianagnostic of course wed love to have a custodial business but well be able to provide these capabilities regardless of who the custodian is and were working on that capability right now and i must i have to say this is going to the pershing in particular is probably the longest in term of our investments so this were really investing for the future and i think before we really start to see the revenues that we expect in that business thats probably two or three years out most of the other ones that weve been talking about are a little more nearterm do you want to emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure again were in the middle of the planning process so its probably too soon to really comment on the expectations specifically for organic growth next year but certainly were really pleased with the momentum that weve seen this year and we would hope to certainly achieve roughly the same amount of organic growth next year brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay okay great and then just quickly on net interest revenue on that down guide im not sure if i had the right base here but does that imply a slight downtick in nir in versus i know emily you said you talked about the trough and i wasnt sure if youre referring to or as the likely trough in nir emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i mean if you do the math it would imply a very a slight downtick about to in the fourth quarter but of course rates are moving all the time like i said were seeing potential upside from some central banks even moving earlier than originally thought so thats what based on the last forecast its slightly down but we think theres potentially some upside and hopefully it will be flat brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay okay great thank you operator our next question comes from robert wildhack with autonomous research the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research good morning guys one more on organic growth if i can how much of that is coming from competitive wins versus say more greenfieldtype opportunities thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp you want to take that emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp i missed it thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah the competitive wins versus greenfield emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so i mean certainly when we look at the entirety of our wins were both new wins of what we call new business it can be new business from completely new clients as well as new business from existing clients so as clients obviously launch new funds et cetera thats still a new business but its new business with existing clients and of course were always very very focused on retention so having the business already and still competitive its competitive out there so making sure that were retaining those deals that we already that we where we are the incumbent when you look at it about its about in terms of the breakdown from like new versus just retention of existing business thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp and were and i think to your point were definitely winning against the competition and a couple of the ones that i even called out today one in the alternatives space that was a different service provider we had a broader set of capabilities in addition to the ability to do the administration so weve won that business we won a couple large businesses over the last takeaways over the last couple quarters so occasionally we lose them but right now our winloss ratio versus the competition is leaning toward our side and we think thats because of the capabilities that weve got as well as the quality of the service that weve been delivering robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research okay thanks and just to stay on retention how is the retention rate been trending and then what kind of opportunities or things can you do to continue to improve the retention rate emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp our retention rates have been trending upwards and we dont really disclose but certainly theyre trending upward and theyre very high so well in excess of so in terms of how i mean the first thing i would say is first and foremost is just client service and basically performing well dayin and dayout and thats what the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 kind of gives you even the right actually to bid and to ultimately retain so were intensely intensely focused on that and then of course its about talking to our clients understanding their strategy more and more were really working in a consultative manner with our clients looking at their issues their challenges and how we can bring the solutions of our the entirety of the firm to bear to help them with their operating model and to get more efficient and to create alpha so its both just being good at the daytoday and also ensuring that our capabilities and both our capabilities and our products are not only competitive but leading edge and then working with the client working with our clients on a very in a consultative and in a strategic manner robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research okay thank you thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks robert operator operator instructions our next question comes from michael brown with kbw michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you operator im not sure if you guys gave this but emily just given most of your comments are on a yearoveryear basis i was just curious given the move in the dollar and the strengthening that we recently saw what was the sequential impact to revenues and expenses in the third quarter versus the second quarter from the move in the dollar emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp oh gosh off the top of my head i cant really i dont have it off the top of my head but i mean the good news is is that actually were pretty equally matched so any benefit you have in revenues or any sorry any headwinds you have in expenses is pretty much equally offset in revenues from us so from a pti perspective were incredibly wellhedged michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc right okay thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp its going to be in the ballpark of to of the expense base sic yearoveryear emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah of the expense base yeah the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then just on the loan book its up yearoveryear the average loans but just sequentially and thats the lowest growth rate weve seen in the last three quarters any particular reason there was a bit of a slowdown this quarter and whats the expectation there going forward emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so i mean just to point out our loan book has grown by yearonyear so theres been very healthy growth in the loan portfolio over time of course growth in any one quarter can be lumpy we did see some healthy growth loans on a spot basis theyre actually up more than theyre up to billion some of the growth were seeing is a growth in margin loans growth in collateralized lending in wealth were seeing growth in our term loans in terms of securities financing and also more demand in terms of capital call facilities so and look we do think we have certainly were proactively looking to grow the loan portfolio and were very we feel that its certainly an area thats in focus and weve got capacity certainly to do so michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks for that clarification thanks for taking my questions thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks michael operator and with that that does conclude our questionandanswer session for today i would now like to hand the call back over to todd with any additional or closing remarks thomas p gibbons chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp no thank you everyone for your interest and obviously you can reach out to marius and the ir team for any followups thank you operator thank you this does conclude todays
