honor to usher in a new chapter with this great institution after spending a significant portion of the past few months engaging with clients regulators employees and other business leaders im excited about our exceptional client franchise our central role in global financial markets and the opportunity that lies ahead now as a new ceo and considering the current environment and it being the time of year when budgets and strategic plans are helpfully debated and brought together naturally im using this opportunity to take a particularly close look at our priorities while im still reviewing everything its apparent to me that while weve made good progress in a number of areas over the last couple of years there are also clearly opportunities to further enhance bny mellons performance for our clients and shareholders alike the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 first i see exciting growth opportunities and numerous examples of innovation like pershing x the reimagining of our collateral and custody platforms digital assets and realtime payments that we need to continue to invest in and execute on with great discipline and urgency second were not just reviewing the top line we are also closely examining our cost base and margins im questioning how we do things and im of the view that our margins should be better in some areas for example we talked to you about improving our pretax margin in securities services to over the medium term more broadly we are also going to be looking for efficiency opportunities as we drive our operating model transformation and will be very determined to see them through and third while we have been providing more holistic solutions to clients that we believe our unique collection of businesses is better placed to deliver we have the potential to do a lot more i touched on this on the last earnings call but i continue to believe that the opportunity to deliver the whole firm through a more unified 1bny mellon is meaningful as we continue to work through and bottom out all of these opportunities in the coming months we will be regularly providing you with progress updates along the way moving on to the quarter ill start with some broader perspectives before i run through a few financial highlights and then ill turn it over to emily to review our financial results in more detail as youre aware during the quarter we continue to see high levels of volatility across both global equity and fixed income markets persistently high inflation driving increased expectations for significant rapid rate increases by central banks in developed countries a strengthening us dollar and a complex geopolitical landscape we also began to see some government intervention for example japan stepping into the fx market to manage their currency and this was particularly on display in the uk wherein the last few weeks there has been extraordinary volatility in the gilt market as a result of the uk governments spending and taxation plans this led to a series of actions by the bank of england including delaying their qt plans announcing a gilt purchase program and a liquidity facility aimed to stabilize the market our business model as a core provider touching so much of the financial system gives us a terrific vantage point on whats going on in markets for example our data shows that building up throughout the quarter and heading into quarter end the market was extremely short euros to levels not seen in quite a few years and weve seen international holders selling us treasuries and more broadly its clear that market liquidity continues to be challenged in some markets more so than in others as we sit here today most markets have continued to function in a relatively orderly fashion trades are settling and faileds and overdrafts are at fairly normal levels but clearly risks are elevated and the system feels more fragile than it was a few months ago while the environment is quite uncertain our platform of trust and innovation is very much in demand by our clients as their cost pressures rise we are seeing a lot of interest in engaging with us to review operating models the scale of our platforms should allow us to lower operating costs for our clients enabling them to focus on their core strengths turning to our performance in the quarter and referring to page of our financial highlights presentation we reported eps of on billion of revenue and a return on tangible common equity of these results were impacted by a goodwill impairment charge that emily will discuss in more detail shortly excluding the impact of notable items eps was up yearoveryear and our return on tangible common equity was revenue grew yearoveryear a testament to the diversity and resiliency of our the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 business model this performance reflected the benefit of higher interest rates as well as continued strength in client volumes and balances across our securities services and market and wealth services segments while investment and wealth management was naturally more affected by the continued decline in global market values particularly in investment management the business delivered positive net inflows in the quarter and continued to deliver solid investment performance for our clients touching on a few business highlights asset servicing continued to deliver solid top line results and our sales momentum remains strong with wins and mandates up from a strong and yet to be installed auca meaningfully higher than last quarter in etfs we continue to see strong net inflows and the total number of fund service is up almost from the beginning of the year were also seeing strong momentum and traction in the alts space and have an active pipeline across credit private equity and real estate and we were pleased to announce that aviva investors a large europeanbased global asset manager recently appointed us to provide a fully integrated operating model for certain front office support services as well as middle and back office activities allowing them to focus on delivering an exceptional client experience powered in no small part by the scale and capabilities of our platform and finally following the formation of our digital assets unit in we are now live with our digital asset custody platform in the us to this point we continue to see significant institutional demand for resilient scalable financial infrastructure built to accommodate both traditional and digital assets and we see digital asset custody as an important foundational capability for the future of financial markets as blockchain technology allows for tokenization of all kinds of assets and currencies but just to be clear we did not invest in this space just for the purpose of custody in crypto we see this as the beginning of a much broader journey pershing had a solid and resilient quarter benefiting from its diverse revenue mix that includes not only market based fees but also transaction fees balancebased fees subscription fees and net interest revenue with many of these income streams playing well in the current environment we also gathered a strong billion of net new assets in the quarter and the pipeline remains healthy boding well for flows in the months ahead pershing x reached another milestone through an equity investment and partnership with conquest planning a fintech which uses ai and powerful analytics tools to help advisors improve their efficiency and create highly customizable financial plans for their clients xs minimum viable product remains on track to launch in the fourth quarter our client engagement together with the product design input which that brings is helping us to accelerate and enhance the delivery of an exciting endtoend digital experience for advisors clearance and collateral management delivered strong growth on the back of higher us clearance volumes as market volatility continues to drive secondary trading activity in us treasuries the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 in fact in september settlement volumes were the highest theyve been since march of we also saw growth in margin related services reflecting the industry leading work that the team is doing to help our clients comply with uncleared margin rules in derivatives trading treasury services achieved a number of wins this quarter as we continue to bring innovative new solutions to the market we were awarded a contract for white labeled trade processing for a major us bank we sponsored our first supply chain financing program for a major investmentgrade corporate client and we were awarded and will be managing payroll and digital asset transfers for a major digital asset client recognizing our momentum in this business the banker named us global transaction bank of the year were also proud to have been recognized by them with additional awards for our work to transform the realtime and digital payment space and optimize trade finance payments by leveraging emerging technologies let me conclude with a note of humility about the uncertainty that were all witnessing in markets these days none of us can predict the exact path of markets and the economic conditions from here and the level of uncertainty is greater than many have become used to as a firm we are positioning ourselves conservatively in this environment and recognize that the strength and stability of our platform is important for the uninterrupted functioning of a significant part of global capital markets were proud of this role and the service that we deliver to our clients around the world with that ill hand it over to emily for the more detailed review of our financial performance in the quarter emily h portney chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thank you robin and good morning everyone as i walk you through the details of our results for the quarter all comparisons will be on a yearoveryear basis unless i specify otherwise starting on page total revenues increased by to billion in the third quarter fee revenue was down as the benefit of lower money market fee waivers and organic growth across our securities services and market and wealth services segment was offset by the impact of lower market values across equity and fixed income markets and the unfavorable impact of the stronger us dollar firmwide assets under custody andor administration of trillion decreased by the impact of lower market values and currency headwinds was tempered by continued growth from new and existing clients and assets under management of trillion decreased by also reflecting lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger us dollar partially offset by cumulative net inflows investment and other revenue was million in the quarter this included a million gain on the sale of our hedgemark subsidiary through our minority equity stake in the combined company we will continue participating in their growth and our clients will certainly benefit from a robust suite of managed account solutions net interest revenue increased by primarily reflecting higher interest rates reported expenses were up this included a million impairment of goodwill associated with our investment management reporting units which was driven by lower market values and a higher discount rate while having impacted our earnings for the quarter this impairment represented a noncash charge and did not the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 affect the firms liquidity position tangible common equity or regulatory capital ratios excluding notable items expenses were up provision for credit losses was a benefit of million primarily reflecting reserve releases related to cash balances and exposure to russia as well as a modest benefit from our commercial real estate portfolio our effective tax rate was or excluding notable items reported eps was pretax margin was and return on tangible common equity was excluding the impact of notable items eps was pretax margin was and return on tangible common equity was now on to capital and liquidity on page our consolidated tier leverage ratio was up basis points sequentially reflecting the benefit of lower average assets which was partially offset by a decrease in tier capital the sharp increase in interest rates especially in the last two weeks of the quarter resulted in an increase of the unrealized loss on our availableforsale securities portfolio of approximately million after tax during the quarter and we distributed approximately million of earnings to our shareholders through common stock dividends as i mentioned earlier the goodwill impairment did not affect our regulatory capital ratios our cet1 ratio was flat sequentially at and finally our lcr was up percentage points sequentially turning to our net interest revenue and balance sheet trends on page which ill also talk about in sequential terms net interest revenue of million was up sequentially this increase primarily reflects higher interest rates on interestearning assets partially offset by higher funding expense average deposit balances decreased the strengthening of the us dollar contributed approximately one percentage point to this decline overall this is largely consistent with our previously expressed expectation for the trajectory of deposit balances through the remainder of the year amid continuously rising interest rates as well as typical seasonal declines in deposit balances in the third quarter while noninterest bearing deposit balances continue to hold up better than we had previously expected average interest earning assets decreased by underneath that cash and reverse repo declined by loan balances decreased by and our securities portfolio balances were down moving on to expenses on page expenses for the quarter were billion on a reported basis excluding notable items expenses of billion were down quarteroverquarter and up yearoveryear this year overyear increase reflects investments net of efficiency saves higher revenue related expenses including higher distribution expenses related to the abatement of fee waivers as well as the impact of inflation partially offset by the benefit of the stronger us dollar a few additional details regarding noteworthy yearoveryear expense variances distribution and servicing expense was up driven by higher distribution costs associated with money market funds business development expenses increased as travel and entertainment expense continued to normalize off a low base last year and lastly the change in other expenses reflects litigation expenses in the prior year turning to page for a closer look at our business segments securities services reported total revenue of billion an increase of compared to the prior year fee revenue was up and net interest revenue increased by driven by higher interest rates partially offset by lower deposit balances the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 as i discuss the performance of our securities services and market and wealth services segment i will focus my comments on investment services fees for each line of business which you can find in our financial supplement in asset servicing investment services fees were down as growth from abating money market fee waivers higher client activity and net new business was more than offset by the impact of lower market values and the strengthening of the us dollar we continue seeing healthy organic growth from both new and existing clients and our sales momentum continues with wins yeartodate up meaningfully compared to an already strong in issuer services investment service fees were up primarily reflecting the reduction of money market fee waivers partially offset by previously disclosed lost business in corporate trust in the prior year and lower fees from depository receipts programs for russian issuers next market and wealth services on page market and wealth services reported total revenue of billion up compared to the prior year fee revenue increased and net interest revenue was up reflecting higher interest rates and higher loan balances partially offset by lower deposit balances in pershing investment services fees were up the positive impact of lower money market fee waivers and higher client activity was partially offset by the impact of previously disclosed lost business in the second half of last year and lower market levels net new assets were billion in the quarter on an annualized basis this translates into a growth rate highlighting a strong quarter of inflows for both new and existing clients especially in this current environment and average active clearing accounts increased by yearonyear in treasury services investment services fees were up driven by lower money market fee waivers new business and slightly higher payment volumes partially offset by higher earnings credits for our clients on the back of higher interest rates and in clearance and collateral management investment services fees were up primarily reflecting higher us government clearance volumes driven by continued demand for us treasury securities due to elevated volatility amid a rapidly evolving monetary policy backdrop now turning to investment and wealth management on page investment and wealth management reported total revenue of million down fee revenue was also down and net interest revenue was up reflecting higher interest rates and higher loan balances as i mentioned earlier assets under management of trillion decreased yearonyear the decrease primarily reflects lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger us dollar as about of our aum are denominated in foreign currencies partially offset by cumulative net inflows as it relates to flows in the quarter we saw billion of net inflows into longterm products and billion of net outflows from cash in investment management revenue was down primarily reflecting lower market values the unfavorable impact of the stronger us dollar as well as changes in the aum mix partially offset by lower fee waivers the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 robin mentioned the extraordinary volatility in the uk government bond market earlier this has caused some significant challenges for uk pension schemes over the past few weeks as a manager of liabilitydriven investment strategies insight has been working closely with our clients to maintain the appropriate hedging levels in their portfolios and id like to note that as an agent between our ldi clients and their market counterparties we have no balance sheet exposure in wealth management revenue was down as the decline in fee revenue resulting from lower market values was partially offset by higher net interest revenue reflecting higher interest rates client assets of billion were down yearoveryear primarily driven by lower market values page shows the results of the other segments as always id like to close with a few comments on our outlook for the remainder of the year as we see it today acknowledging the heightened uncertainty about the macroeconomic environment and continued market volatility based on current market implied interest rates we now expect net interest revenue for the full year to be up approximately compared to as we expect another quarter of sequential nir growth given the continued decline in equity and fixed income markets as well as the continued strengthening of the us dollar we now expect fee revenue for the full year to be down slightly compared to assuming equity and fixed income values as well as currencies stay at the levels where they ended the third quarter we continue to expect expenses excluding notable items for the full year to be within the range of up to that we had guided you throughout the year that being said we are intensely focused on disciplined expense management and are working hard to drive this towards the bottom half of that range and we still expect an effective tax rate between and in the fourth quarter and finally ill note that we continue to manage to a tier leverage ratio target of as well as a cet1 ratio target of as we think about the right timing for a resumption of buybacks in the coming months we will continue to be prudent and consider capital levels the expected trajectory of deposit balances and aoci as well as the economic outlook at that time with that operator can you please open the line for questions the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions as a reminder we ask you that you please limit yourself to one question and one related followup question our first question comes from the line of glenn schorr from evercore please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thank you so i appreciate your comments about acting as agent in the ldi cases in the uk i wonder if we could get a little more of the ins and outs the impact to both bk and clients because insight has been a great acquisition thats produced a lot of flows for you in the past so im curious on impacts in the quarter ph when you get more collateral ph but clients have lower balances and what you think clients are going to do with this business going forward thank you robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp sure well good morning glenn and thanks for the question obviously this topics been in the news a lot over the course of the past few weeks lets maybe just start by stepping back and remember what ldi actually stands for and what it is so its liabilitydriven investing and the principle at work as i think you know but let me just recap it is really the investment approach that ensures that the assets ultimately are moving more in line with the value of the liabilities and so we think that principle which has been very important to the pension space over time is an important one and its going to be something that we would expect to continue i mean these strategies have been employed by many years theyve been extensively embraced by the pension regulators in the uk and then the consultants who advise our pension clients in the space the second thing id say is that more broadly higher interest rates have actually served to improve the funding positions of most pension funds because the value of the liabilities has decreased by more than the decreases in their gilt holdings and so that has been a net positive in terms of contributing to the pension funds funding status but look clearly as you pointed out the speed and the magnitude of the rise in the uk government bond yields has been pretty unprecedented and certainly has created challenges in the market with the sort of speed and magnitude of everything thats been going on and thats created issues including liquidity issues for many of these pension funds whove had to sell gilts and mobilize other forms of liquidity in order to be able to meet the margin calls on derivatives and as you know they are the ph principle on the derivatives this has clearly put a strain on the markets i mean the sheer size of the pension market versus the uk gilt market just sort of shows the degree of impact that they can have and its also highlighted some operational challenges if you just think about the two day settlement of margin versus the time to liquidate assets across the wider asset pools and thats been exacerbated actually by some operational providers we actually dont provide direct operational support to insight thats done by a thirdparty and whats happened as a result of all of that well clearly people are raising additional liquidity which makes a lot of sense now weve been pleased to the other part of your question weve been pleased with insights performance theyve been focused actually on building collateral buffers throughout the year and this prudence i think has the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 been quite helpful in protecting client portfolios and insights also been over time working on a strategy that they called integrated solutions which is really encouraging pension funds to be able to look across all of the types of assets that they have so that they see the whole and not just the individual pieces so the investment of maybe less liquid components is done with a mind and a view to whats being done and where leverage might exist elsewhere in the portfolio and i think that that integrated approach which theyve been a big proponent of has actually been a good solution in this particular crisis and so we actually think that netnet our solutions being strengthened in the market insights reputation has done quite well in fact they are turning away new business as theyve seen and benefited frankly from the incomings and a bit of the flight to quality so clearly a situation thats still evolving todays market looks a little bit better following some of the news at the end of last week and over the weekend but were watching it very closely glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi so i appreciate all that color i follow everything and it feels like nothing on balance sheet risk didnt have major client outflows the last part i wasnt sure about is why would they be turning away new business or are clients not going to use this as much forward or just use less leverage im curious on your outlook again i think it was a good source of flows in the past and just audio gap what you think going forward robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah so the reason why weve been turning away some new business is because really we want to protect the interest of our existing clients and so taking on more problematic situations and there are some in the market which have less funding and liquidity available and then essentially taking them into our franchise and having to deal with that problem this didnt seem like the smartest moments to do that and also frankly wasnt in the interest of our existing clients whove been along with insight along the journey so thats actually the reason there but more broadly we do expect to continue to get incoming phone calls given some of the differentiated nature of how insights performed through this and we view that to be positive for the franchise so actually i view that as something of a tailwind because these types of reputational events in the market frankly can sift out some of the different players glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay i appreciate all that robin thank you operator the next question comes from mike brown from kbw please go ahead michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 good morning michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so robin i noticed that the auca declined just about quarteroverquarter this would be less than wed expect given the market backdrop here you talked about the strong sales momentum and recent wins so how much did organic growth contribute this quarter if you could kind of quantify that and when did that come in in the quarter emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp hi good morning its emily ill take that the auca it really speaks to the trends in auca speak to the diversity of the franchise overall so firmwide auca was down about that was based on lower securities services auca of about but very much tempered by growth in market and wealth services led by ccm if you want to kind of drill down a bit more in terms of securities services and what youre seeing there about the decline about of that was due to lower market values as well as the strengthening us dollar and that was partially offset by about of net new business michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you emily and then and if i heard your comments correctly on the share buybacks it sounds like its really dependent on the capital levels but did i understand that correctly that its still possible that you will that you could be in the market for buybacks this quarter if the capital levels perform as expected emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp as i said in my prepared remarks and its very important that everyone really understands were going to continue to be prudent with respect to buybacks so i think thats natural given the continued volatility that were seeing across the markets and frankly the uncertain macroeconomic environment we also we do want to be above our internal targets for our capital ratios before we consider resuming buybacks so it is true that when we think about capital distribution frankly our approach hasnt changed whether its this quarter or next quarter its always going to be informed by the rate trajectory and the corresponding impact on aoci the size of our balance sheet market conditions of course and frankly our forward outlook but what i would remind everybody is that beyond the near term we have a business model that really allows a meaningful amount of return to of our capital to shareholders and pending the sale of alcentra as well as over time as rates do move in a different direction that aoci will be pulling back to par and that will both of those things will free up meaningful capital levels michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you for taking my questions the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you mike operator we will now take our next question from steven chubak from wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc wanted to startoff with a question on the operating margin while the operating backdrop robin as you noted remains highly uncertain in the last fed tightening cycle the company was generating mid operating margins fairly consistently so well above current levels i just wanted to get your perspective or take on whether you see a credible path to getting to those type back to those types of operating margins and what are some of the drivers that could potentially help you close the gap here robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp sure steven well ill just start by reminding you and i mentioned this in my prepared remarks but when we announced our resegmentation in december last year emily and i both commented on the fact that we were driving towards a plus margin in our securities services segment which as you know is not where we have been and we said at the time that was going to be made up of a variety of different components it was going to be top line organic growth it was also going to be of course the rate cycle which is a meaningful contributor and we do view that as an important contributor to our firm and then third it was going to be through focus on the bottom line and so if you take that as a microcosm for a second thats exactly how i think about the strategy for the whole firm were laserfocused on executing on our growth investments things like pershing x realtime payments and some of the other things that ive detailed before but we also have to be a very good steward of expenses and although weve made significant investments in resiliency over the course of the past four to five years i feel that there is more room for us to be able to invest in efficiencyrelated technology so investing in technology on the top line and the bottom line but with a more sense of tangible payoffs that are available than maybe weve seen in the resiliency space which is really a cost of doing business emily can comment maybe just for a moment on our budget process because were in that season and weve adjusted our budget process to really try to get at this margin question that you raised emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 sure so we are as robin said intensely focused on our forward expense trajectory and in the budget cycle that weve just kicked off were actually doubling down on a rubric that weve actually used historically but mostly just for tech and now were looking at it and applying that rubric across the entire company and in effect what were doing is stratifying all of our expenses across three buckets so first is really structural or run the bank second is change the bank and were really drilling into that category to be very clear about if were making investments are they for growth are they to transform or for that matter are they to continue to meet ongoing regulatory obligations and third of course the third bucket is just revenue related which obviously rise with top line growth so i can share that as we go through this more than of our expenses are structural in nature they are certainly higher than we think they should be as robin has alluded to and were very heavily focused on driving these down in some areas we have multiyear programs like transfer agency fund accounting et cetera which our businesses that are highly manual in nature and we do have programs to make them more efficient and well come back to you when we finish the planning process steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for all that color its really helpful perspective and maybe just for my followup on the deposit outlook emily you noted that the noninterest bearing outflows have been tracking better so far this cycle and as a percentage of total deposits its still fairly elevated at i believe last cycle at trough somewhere around whats your expectation in terms of the pace of noninterest bearing outflow whats driving the better outcome this cycle and where do you expect nibs to ultimately trough this cycle relative to last emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so i think ive mentioned and we still believe that nibs will ultimately revert to what we saw prepandemic which would be about to of our total deposit base we actually think that that might happen here in the fourth quarter in terms of why theyve held so so steady i think some of that is probably riskoff behavior some of that is just our businesses are a bit bigger and ultimately what i would say is that we have seen when we look at our deposit trend overall and this is very important irrespective nibs or ibs the runoff weve seen thus far has been largely nonoperational in nature and thats actually good were seeing the right runoff and i think very much due to our very whats become much more sophisticated pricing across clients and segments in businesses steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc helpful color thanks so much for taking my questions operator we will now take our next question from betsy graseck from morgan stanley please go ahead ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi this is ryan kenny on behalf of betsy good morning the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp morning robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp wondering if you could emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp good morning ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc give us more color on the goodwill charge what specifically was the driver of the charge this quarter and does it give you more flexibility on your strategy and investment management robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp sure happy to so first of all lets be clear about what it is and what it isnt so its not the outcome of any changes in our strategy its also not related to the pending sale of alcentra and its also not a statement about the fundamental health of the business as we see it today and going forward it is the outcome of our regular impairment testing process and its a reflection of both the lower market values that weve seen across equity and fixed income markets and also a higher discount rate so inevitably wrapped up in your question is the strategy and so maybe ill just recap for a second where we are on that investment management journey as you know over the course of the past years or so weve streamlined the investment portfolio we used to have independent investment management firms thats down to seven once alcentra is closed that helps us to sharpen our focus as does the fact that weve improved substantially the alignment between strategy and the individual firms and so weve realigned mellons investment capabilities into parts of newton and insight and dreyfus we think that helps make it less confusing for our clients externally and sharpens the focus internally were also investing in the types of solutions that of course people want in this day and age and some of those outcome orientated solutions active etfs responsible investing we talked about bold i think on our last earnings call in the money market fund space its another example of that and then very importantly in the investment management space the investment performance has improved and remains healthy so kind of thats where we are ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 youre welcome operator we will now take our next question from alex blostein from goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everybody thanks for the question so theres been a number of liquidity challenges in the market and robin you alluded to those in your prepared remarks as well so as bk serves obviously a fairly critical function in sort of the capital markets plumbing globally what are some of the risks i guess youre most mindful of that that we should be looking after and as you think about any opportunities that this kind of environment creates for the bank as well would love to hear your thoughts on that robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp sure so alex weve got a bunch of different crosscurrents at the moment in the system on the cash side were coming off the back of qe central bank is obviously driving very aggressively at inflation clearly necessary given the continued prints but then on the flip side and these two things dont necessarily always happen at the same time which is what makes it complicated is weve got supply chain issues ongoing geopolitics energy prices risks of recession already very much front and center and so weve got sort of a risk on and risk off angles happening at the same time weve also seen some pretty unprecedented starting places for some of these markets and i think thats a little bit for us where we see some of the concern which is the usual toolkits around market stability arent available in maybe quite the same way you saw that in the uk where just to take that as a microcosm for a second their bond market goes through a little bit of tumult as a result of some news in the government actions and at the time the bank of england was still in the qt process which they had to suspend to then go do some buying you just cant really be doing buying and selling at the same time thats a good example of the fact that the toolkits arent fully available we look at the scale of moves in the market and we look at the amounts of liquidity and so much has been done in the banking sector particularly over the course of the past decade post financial regulatory reform the regulators have been very much at it so banks massive amounts of liquidity large amounts of capital very well set up for this but if you have huge selling from other market constituents there is a little bit of a question there of where the buyer is going to be and we see echoes of that in the uk market there are legitimate concerns about that in the us market if there were a significant episode as weve seen in the past what does that pivot looks like and to some extent those are the consequences of having and benefiting from the most liquid markets in the world on a normal basis and also being the place where people store their cash and when they want cash they need it back and theyre selling so the question becomes who are the buyers weve seen the central bank of japan having to be sellers of treasuries as they defend their currency so theres a lot going on in the world and its a bit complex but i think we have a healthy amount of caution as we saw this play out over the course of the coming weeks and months alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 got you all right thanks and then my followup just around the ldi dynamic again and i appreciate your comments around insight on the asset management side but i guess as a servicer curious how youre thinking about your exposure to uk pension plans on the asset servicing side of the business either as custodian or middle of back office administrator any sort of implications for fees or deposits we should be thinking about as you give pensions post more collateral robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah its been pretty business as usual for us on the servicing side as i mentioned before that isnt the case everywhere clearly there have been issues in that market and there were a couple of providers whove had some more stresses associated with the massive upsurge in volumes but that has not been our experience clearly there is more cash in the market generally and let me just make a broader point about cash because i think its very interesting position for us as a company the various different roles that we play in cash because yes we have deposits on our balance sheet that tends to be a lot of the focus that we talk about in terms of cash but we actually manage over trillion of daily liquidity for our clients in markets all around the world and this goes way beyond deposits on our balance sheet it goes to our money market fund business it goes to a marketleading liquidity direct portal which helps treasurers and other cash managers be able to direct cash through the system and so we actually feel pretty well positioned as a company on the topic of cash because sort of irrespective of exactly where the flow is heading we set ourselves in a little bit of an orchestration role in the middle of that which we think is really quite good for our franchise over time alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great that makes sense thanks for that robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks operator we will now take our next question from mike mayo from wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi can you hear me emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yes robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp yes mike the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great im going to answer my question i think which youre guiding a little bit lower for fees but youre not guiding lower for expenses and i guess the answer is because youre looking to invest through the cycle if you can validate that and then just more on the digital asset custody platform you said that custody of digital assets and crypto are simply the start of a journey and theres a lot written pro and con as it relates to digital currencies clearly you think this has legs maybe thats one reason why youre going to invest maybe more even with softer fees but if you could elaborate on that robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp sure mike let me ill take the whole thing so first of all in terms of were not reguiding on expenses emily said that the original guidance of to is intact but she also said that were aiming towards the lower end of that range so thats meant to be sort of a vote of confidence in our own active management of expenses which were really driving at and we are very very focused as emily said earlier on on this journey and so you should expect us to continue to give you updates on how we do on that over time let me talk a little bit about digital assets because it is a very important question and i tried to stress this in my prepared remarks around the fact that it really isnt just about crypto so one of the things that we did recently was we did a survey of large institutional asset managers asset owners hedge funds about of them already hold crypto in their portfolios about of them are actively investing or exploring investing in digital assets but heres the important stat which is over of them are interested in investing in some type of tokenized asset within the next few years and so what we heard from our clients is they want institutional grade solutions in the space and the way that we think about the world is yeah sure there are cryptos and those are things that clearly have had a lot of spotlight recently but we view the tokenization of other types of assets whether theyre traditional financial assets or maybe assets that havent been as easy to manage in the financial system like hard commodities real estate forests there are all sorts of things you could think about certificates and with the world of esg some of those things could be much better managed using tokens and then also tokenized currencies where real currencies fiat currencies or proxies for fiat currencies we also think could be quite interesting now all of this is over the course of the next few years the actual dematerialization of assets from paper into technology back in the and took a long time to actually happen it was not coincidentally happening with the rise of computing in business now weve got a new technology the rise of that in business we think is going to be important but im not going to put an exact time scale on it but its years maybe its even decades for full adoption but we thought that with a longerterm view this was an important space now were not spending a ton of money on it but were deliberately investing in smart places in that ecosystem so that we are prepared to be there for our clients over the long term on this important journey mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and what was the tipping point just as a followup the tipping point for you to really highlight this i mean this is front and center here this was the third area that youve mentioned investing you said pershing x collateral digital assets realtime payments this was number three on your list so certainly its moved up in priority and the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 crypto has been around a little while now what was the tipping point here was it a new survey of your clients did you see something in the market whats changed robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp so i mentioned the survey the survey wasnt the tipping point but it was an affirmation but the answer to your question is client demand our clients want institutional grade custody and solutions in this space and i enjoyed the quip that i read in the media maybe a year or so ago which is you know what its not a real asset until bny mellon say theyll look after it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thank you operator we will now take our next question from brennan hawken from ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions a couple of followups on deposits so emily youve previously indicated that you had expected by fourth quarter that deposits on an average basis would be down to they were actually down theyre already down based on the average should we still think about that range of to or might that end up being different and maybe if you could update on how beta is tracking in your expectation there too emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure good morning brennan so youre correct i did guide i think it was around second quarter that wed expect a decline of about to by well average to average  to  in the third quarter as you also rightfully pointed out deposits down now thats in part due to the strengthening of the us dollar which was a headwind of about and also just seasonality just that you normally see lower deposit levels in the third quarter for the fourth quarter we are anticipating a decline of about to and as i mentioned before we expect it to be mostly in nibs as the percentage of nibs as a total of our deposit base kind of reverts back to prepandemic levels and like anything theres a lot of uncertainty out there so this is what we are anticipating based on the forward curve and ultimately the forward curve and what we have been seeing so far this year in terms of betas betas do continue to be a little better than we had anticipated just as a note they do vary widely by line of business so treasury services and markets are certainly have much higher betas than say asset servicing or corporate trust so its just important to keep that in mind looking ahead we do expect marginal betas to continue to ramp higher as rates continue to rise but at the end of the day we do think that they will largely retrace what we saw in the last cycle and so ultimately end up higher than where they are today and again i would just say thats just another factor whether its deposit balances or betas those are all factors that are somewhat uncertain based upon the macroeconomic backdrop the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yeah okay thanks for that and then another sort of related question helpful to get full year nii expectation for sure but when we step back a bit and think about i know its too early to comment on next year but just sort of generally speaking at this point weve gotten back to tripledigit nim rates continue to be pretty robust you think your beta is going to largely retrace last cycle as you just said is there any reason why the nim cant retrace the prior cycle nim and when we think about the security reinvestment tailwinds for any reason why once policy rates stop moving higher youre going to largely see some stabilization because thats what kicks off most of your deposit repricing and then youve got a tailwind from reinvestment that continues to flow through into is there anything wrong with thinking about things that way and how long do you think it might take for the nim to is it possible to retrace the last cycle and how long do you think that might take emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp well theres a lot there so let me try to unpack it a bit as you have seen from our financials weve seen several consecutive quarters of sharp increases in nim we do expect another step up in the fourth quarter and even beyond the fourth quarter based on a lot of the factors that you mentioned we do expect that nim will continue to expand but probably at a slower rate in terms of portfolio positioning we do actually think that rates will continue to surprise to the upside and so were therefore really positioned for greater asset sensitivity but of course we can continue to be nimble there and as we think about the portfolio overall obviously were managing it with the objective of optimizing capital liquidity as well as nir brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thanks for that color operator we will now take our next question from brian bedell from deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning folks robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning brian brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning that was kind of my question on net interest income as well maybe just one point on that just technical on the fed funds purchased spread thats seen on the asset and liability side i see that spread went up to about million in versus million in the second quarter i guess how should we think about that book the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 as more of a matched book with a spread sort of contained in that area or actually is that poised to dramatically rise in the next couple of quarters emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i think on that particular question i think its just best to follow up specifically with ir brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp if youre asking more specifically about the kind of the outlook for nir which is kind of the broaderbased question based on the forward curve that we see today we would probably expect some growth from our  exit rate and just to kind of talk a bit about the drivers there of course as i mentioned earlier we expect central banks to continue to increase rates and theyll probably remain elevated for most of the year we do think that a large majority of the deposit outflows will be behind us by yearend and again thats largely because our client base is institutional more rate sensitive than sensitive to the size of the balance sheet we could have a little bit more runoff but we do expect also some organic growth nibs as ive already talked about and marginal betas will increase so all of those factors just are kind of coming into the fact that we would expect some growth from our fourth quarter exit rates of course lots of uncertainties brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah no thats great color and maybe if i can pivot to the organic growth initiatives that you talked about in your prepared remarks robin maybe if you could just focus on realtime payments youve talked a lot about pershing x recently and of course the digital platform but maybe just if you can talk a little bit about sort of the what youre thinking in that area and to what extent you think these initiatives can enhance that organic growth rate i dont know if its too early to put out a target there for or or do you think were going to stay in the sort of plus range for a little while robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp so its a little too early for a specific target as i mentioned in my prepared remarks were working through all of the various different businesses understanding the priorities for each one and as we come out of all of that well have a better sense from that part of the question but let me talk about realtime payments because i think this is quite interesting for a few different reasons it is a new payment rail and whenever theres a disruption or a change in the ecosystem you have some degree of change in sort of the established order or at least the opportunity for that disruption and so for us we think that those opportunities dont come along every day and so were quite focused on taking advantage of that the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 but its also part of a broader solution set because providing faster payments is nice and safer payments is good but when its combined with the ability to do digital invoicing in the request for payment and when thats combined with payment validation fraud protection and other data services they can become very interesting solutions for clients and we view ourselves as not just a payment provider but a platform provider for entry into the banking system and we think this is where it overlaps very nicely youll remember that we cover of the worlds top banks that makes us with that installed customer base and then the leadership on the product side it makes us a very appealing partner for fintechs and regional banks as they are thinking about wanting to take advantage of all those capabilities but either because they dont actually want to be a bank in the case of some fintechs or in the case of the fact that its very expensive to make all of this investment and weve done that in the case of other regional banks were now providing access to rtp zelle account validation soon to be fednow white label solutions and with the realtime invoicing and we think that whoever gets that collective set of rails up and running really frankly has an advantage and as you know we were the first bank to make realtime payments we were the first to launch a realtime ebilling and were a leading in the whole process with fednow as part of that rollout as well working very closely with the fed and other banks as well so its for all of those reasons that i think this is an interesting space we havent put a number on it but were certainly getting franchise traction brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats great color thank you operator and our final question comes from gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning everyone emily robin vince a chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you just share with us your way you guys are managing your securities portfolio in view i think you said you think rates will be going higher as we go forward in terms of the strategies of moving some into heldto maturity versus available for sale to protect you on the aoci and as you go forward how are you looking at the aoci issue emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so as i did say before we do expect the environment to remain volatile and actually rates to continue to surprise to the upside and frankly we really would need some change in tone from central banks or some the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 evidence that inflation is declining probably to change our view on that so we are continuing to position the portfolio for greater asset sensitivity yeartodate we have reduced dv01 by about duration is also the lowest its been in a really long time you do mention that certainly we did also take measures earlier in the year to protect against aoci volatility and so we did move a portion of the portfolio about of it now is in held to maturity that certainly has helped with diminishing aoci unrealized losses they would have been more of course than they have been if we had not taken that action but ultimately the portfolio is positioned for greater asset sensitivity having said that we are going to be very very nimble and should the environment change we do benefit actually from the fact that of the portfolio is designated as available for sale and has a short duration so we can be pretty flexible and act very swiftly gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc does it make sense since you have so much in available for sale youre an advanced approach bank so its already going through your cet1 ratio to actually take some realized losses and then redeploy those funds at higher yields emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp we feel very comfortable where we are in terms of held to maturity we really want to retain flexibility and also certainly want the flexibility around not only managing interest rate risk but of course liquidity as well gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just as a followup question i know youve touched a lot about your deposits today in your answers to questions just one last question on deposits qt now is in full speed operation here in the united states have you noticed any change in the deposit outflows since weve gone to the billion billion a month and how do you i know you pointed out deposits are going to come down in the fourth quarter but when you look out to next year is that going to change your thinking at all or is it behaving as you expected emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i think as i indicated deposit outflows are behaving pretty much as we anticipated we do think the lions share of the runoff will be behind us by the end of this year why we think that our client base is predominantly institutional in the past and even now theyve proven to be much more sensitive to rates than actually just the size of the feds balance sheet also just as a reminder our businesses are much bigger theyve grown significantly since what weve seen in the last cycle so treasury services is much bigger auca and asset servicing is much bigger where that comes just naturally more deposits the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript  earnings call 17oct2022 and even what weve seen in the runoff as i suggested or said before its been mostly nonoperational so i think we feel pretty good about our expectations here and that the large majority is behind us having said that could there be more runoff yes i mean theres so much uncertainty whether its interest rate volatility the levels of the rrp macroeconomic uncertainty in general so thats our best estimate based on the forward curve of what weve seen thus far gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator and with that that does conclude our questionandanswer session for today i will now hand the call over back to robin with any additional or closing remarks robin vince chief executive officer president director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you operator and thank you everyone for your interest in bny mellon if you have any
