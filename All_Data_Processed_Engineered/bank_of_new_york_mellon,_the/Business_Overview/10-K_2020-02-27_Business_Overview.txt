providers such as financial services data processing firms our investment management business competes with domestic and international asset management firms hedge funds investment banking companies and other financial services companies including trust banks brokerage firms and insurance companies as well as a wide range of technology service providers competition is based on a number of factors including among others customer service transaction execution capital or access to capital quality and range of products and services offered technological innovation and expertise price reputation rates lending limits and customer convenience competition in the financial services industry continues to be intense and we may be at a competitive disadvantage to institutions that are not similarly
