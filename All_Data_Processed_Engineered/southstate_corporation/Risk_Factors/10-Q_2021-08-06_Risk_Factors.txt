additional risk factor to supplement the risk factors contained in item of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december we may face risks with respect to future expansion including our proposed acquisition of atlantic capital our business growth profitability and market share have been enhanced by us engaging in strategic mergers and acquisitions and de novo branching either within or contiguous to our existing footprint we have entered into an agreement and plan of merger with atlantic capital and we may acquire other financial institutions or parts of those institutions in the future and engage in additional de novo branching we may also consider and enter into or acquire new lines of business or offer new products or services as part of our acquisition strategy we seek companies that are culturally similar to us have experienced management and are in markets in which we operate or close to those markets so we can achieve economies of scale we also may receive future inquiries and have discussions with potential acquirers of us or potential companies in which we may engage in a socalled merger of equals acquisitions and mergers including our proposed acquisition of atlantic capital involve a number of risks including the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners inaccurate estimates and judgments regarding credit operations management and market risks of the target institution the time and costs of evaluating new markets hiring experienced local management and opening new offices and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion our ability to receive regulatory approvals on terms that are acceptable to us our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders the diversion of our managements attention to the negotiation of a transaction and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses entry into new markets where we lack experience the strain of growth on our infrastructure staff internal controls and management which may require additional personnel time and expenditures exposure to potential asset quality issues with acquired institutions the introduction of new products and services into our business the possibility of unknown or contingent liabilities the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse shortterm effects on our results of operations and the risk of loss of key employees and customers we also face litigation risks with respect to potential mergers and acquisitions and such litigation is common we expect to continue to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities that are presented to us in our current and expected markets and conduct due diligence related to those opportunities as well as negotiate to acquire or merge with other institutions if we announce a transaction we may issue equity securities including common stock and securities convertible into shares of our common stock in connection with future acquisitions we also may issue debt to finance one or more transactions including subordinated debt issuances generally acquisitions of financial institution involve the payment of a premium over book and market values resulting in dilution of our book value and fully diluted earnings per share as well as dilution to our existing shareholders we may incur substantial costs to expand and we can give no assurance such expansion will result in the levels of profits we seek there is no assurance that following any future mergers or acquisitions including our proposed acquisition of atlantic capital that our integration efforts will be successful or our company after giving effect to the acquisition will achieve increased revenues comparable to or better than our historical experience and failure to realize such expected revenue increases cost savings increases in market presence or other benefits could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions and results of operations we may not be able to successfully integrate our latest mergers or to realize the anticipated benefits of them on june the company and csfl combined in a merger of equals and we successfully completed the systems and operational conversion in may in addition we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with atlantic capital on july if the proposed acquisition of atlantic capital is completed we will also integrate the systems and operations of atlantic capital a successful integration of these banks operations with our operations so that the company operates as one entity depends substantially on our ability to successfully consolidate operations management teams corporate cultures systems and procedures and to eliminate redundancies and costs while we have substantial experience in successfully integrating institutions we have acquired we may encounter difficulties during integration such as the loss of key employees and customers the disruption of operations and businesses inability to maintain and increase competitive presence loan deposit and revenue attrition inconsistencies in standards control procedures and policies unexpected issues with planned branch and other facilities closures unexpected issues with costs operations personnel and technology and problems with the assimilation of new operations sites or personnel integration activities could divert resources from regular operations in addition general market and economic conditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry generally may inhibit the companys successful integration of these entities in addition we merged with csfl and have proposed to acquire atlantic capital with the expectation that these mergers will result in various benefits including among other things benefits relating to enhanced revenues a strengthened and expanded market position for the combined company technology efficiencies cost savings and operating efficiencies achieving the anticipated benefits of these mergers is subject to a number of uncertainties including whether we integrate these institutions in an efficient and effective manner and general competitive factors in the marketplace failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in a reduction in the price of our shares as well as in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of managements time and energy and could materially and adversely affect the companys financial condition results of operations business and prospects changes to or the application of incorrect assumptions estimates or judgements in our financial statements could cause significant unexpected losses or impacts in the future for example the cecl standard as of january requires that we provide reserves for a current estimate of lifetime expected credit losses for our loan portfolios and other financial assets if applicable at the time those assets are acquired or originated this estimate is adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit losses our allowance for credit losses estimate depends upon the cecl models and assumptions and forecasted macroeconomic conditions including among other things the south atlantic unemployment rate and the credit indicators composition and other characteristics of our loan and other applicable portfolios these model assumptions and forecasted macroeconomic conditions will change over time whether due to the covid19 pandemic or other factors resulting in greater variability in our acl compared to its provision for loan losses under the previous gaap methodology and thus will impact operations as well as regulatory capital including as the cecl phasein begins as of january
