enter mature markets in accordance with our expansion strategy we experience strong competition from both bank and nonbank competitors we compete with national banks superregional banks smaller community banks nontraditional internet based banks credit unions insurance companies and government sponsored entities we also compete with other financial intermediaries and investment alternatives such as mortgage companies credit card issuers leasing companies finance companies money market mutual funds brokerage firms governmental and corporation bonds and other securities firms many of these nonbank competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulatory oversight affording them a competitive advantage in some instances in many cases our competitors have substantially greater resources and offer certain services that we are unable to provide to our customers we encounter strong competition in making loans and attracting deposits we compete with other financial institutions

for the protection of depositors and the federal deposit insurance corporations the fdics deposit insurance fund and not for the protection of our shareholders and creditors the following is a general summary of the material aspects of certain statutes and regulations applicable to us these summary descriptions are not complete and you should refer to the full text of the statutes regulations and corresponding guidance for more information these statutes and regulations are subject to change and additional statutes regulations and corresponding guidance may be adopted we are unable to predict these future changes or the effects if any that these changes could have on our business revenues and results of operations general the current regulatory environment for financial institutions includes substantial enforcement activity by the federal banking agencies the us department of justice the sec the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb and other state and federal law enforcement agencies this regulatory environment has associated risks of significant potential increases in compliance requirements and associated costs we are a bank holding company registered with the board of governors of the federal reserve system and are subject to the supervision of and to regular inspection by the federal reserve board in addition as a south carolina bank holding company organized under the south carolina banking and branching efficiency act we are subject to limitations on sale or merger and to regulation by the south carolina board of financial institutions the scbfi our bank is organized as a south carolinachartered commercial bank it is subject to regulation supervision and examination by the scbfi and the fdic the following discussion summarizes certain aspects of banking and other laws and regulations that affect south state and our bank under the bank holding company act the bhc act our activities and those of our bank are limited to banking managing or controlling banks furnishing services to or performing services for our bank or any other activity which the federal reserve board determines to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto the bhc act requires prior federal reserve board approval for among other things the acquisition by a bank holding company of direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares or substantially all the assets of any bank or for a merger or consolidation of a bank holding company with another bank holding company the bhc act also prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect control of more than of the outstanding voting stock of any company engaged in a nonbanking business unless such business is determined by the federal reserve board to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto further under south carolina law it is unlawful without the prior approval of the scbfi for any south carolina bank holding company i to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any bank or any other bank holding company ii to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of a bank or any other bank holding company or iii to merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company the grammleachbliley act also known as the financial modernization act of amended a number of federal banking laws affecting the company and our bank in particular the grammleachbliley act permits a bank holding company to elect to become a financial holding company provided certain conditions are met a financial holding company and the companies it controls are permitted to engage in activities considered financial in nature as defined by the grammleach bliley act and federal reserve board interpretations including without limitation insurance and securities activities and therefore may engage in a broader range of activities than permitted by bank holding companies and their subsidiaries we have not sought financial holding company status but we may elect that status in the future if we were to elect in writing for financial holding company status we would be required to be well capitalized and well managed and each insured depository institution we control would also have to be well capitalized well managed and have at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act discussed below interstate banking federal legislation permits outofstate acquisitions by bank holding companies interstate branching by banks and interstate merging by banks the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the doddfrank act which was signed into law in july and is discussed more fully below removed previous state law restrictions on de novo interstate branching in various states in which we operate this change effectively permits outofstate banks to open de novo branches in states where the laws of such state would permit a bank chartered by that state to open a de novo branch obligations of a holding company to its subsidiary banks a number of obligations and restrictions are imposed by law regulations and regulatory policies applicable to bank holding companies with regard to their depository institution subsidiaries that are designed to minimize potential loss to depositors and to the fdics deposit insurance fund in the event that the depository institution becomes in danger of defaulting under its obligations to repay deposits under a policy of the federal reserve board which was confirmed in the doddfrank act a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia to avoid receivership of its insured depository institution subsidiary a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any insured depository institution subsidiary that may become undercapitalized within the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal banking agency up to the lesser of i an amount equal to of the institutions total assets at the time the institution became undercapitalized or ii the amount which is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all applicable capital standards as of the time the institution fails to comply with such capital restoration plan the federal reserve board also has the authority under the bhc act to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank upon the federal reserve boards determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or stability of any subsidiary depository institution of the bank holding company further federal law grants federal bank regulatory authorities additional discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or nonbank subsidiary if the agency determines that divestiture may aid the depository institutions financial condition in addition the cross guarantee provisions of the federal deposit insurance act fdia require insured depository institutions under common control to reimburse the fdic for any loss suffered or reasonably anticipated by the fdic as a result of the default of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or for any assistance provided by the fdic to a commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default the fdics claim for damages is superior to claims of shareholders of the insured depository institution or its holding company but is subordinate to claims of depositors secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt other than affiliates of the commonly controlled insured depository institutions the fdia also provides that amounts received from the liquidation or other resolution of any insured depository institution by any receiver must be distributed after payment of secured claims to pay the deposit liabilities of the institution prior to payment of any other general or unsecured senior liability subordinated liability general creditor or shareholder this provision would give depositors a preference over general and subordinated creditors and shareholders in the event a receiver is appointed to distribute the assets of our bank any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank in the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act was signed into law in july and impacts

conduct studies upon which future regulation may be based while many have been issued some remain to be issued governmental intervention and new regulations could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations basel capital standards regulatory capital rules adopted in july and fullyphased in as of january which we refer to as the basel iii rules or basel iii impose minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks the basel iii rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with more than billion in total consolidated assets more stringent requirements are imposed on advanced approaches banking organizations which are organizations with billion or more in total consolidated assets billion or more in total foreign exposures or that have opted into the basel iii capital regime specifically we are required to maintain the following minimum capital levels table start a common equity tier cet1 riskbased capital ratio of table endtable start a tier riskbased capital ratio of table endtable start a total riskbased capital ratio of and table endtable start a leverage ratio of table end under basel iii tier capital includes two components cet1 capital and additional tier capital the highest form of capital cet1 capital consists solely of common stock plus related surplus retained earnings accumulated other comprehensive income otherwise referred to as aoci and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock additional tier capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock tier minority interests and grandfathered trust preferred securities as discussed below tier capital generally includes the allowance for loan losses up to of riskweighted assets qualifying preferred stock subordinated debt and qualifying tier minority interests less any deductions in tier instruments of an unconsolidated financial institution cumulative perpetual preferred stock is included only in tier capital except that the basel iii rules permit bank holding companies with less than billion in total consolidated assets to continue to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before may in tier capital but not in cet1 capital subject to certain restrictions aoci is presumptively included in cet1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital when implemented basel iii provided a onetime opportunity at the end of the first quarter of for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of aoci we made this optout election and as a result retained our preexisting treatment for aoci in addition in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives under basel iii a banking organization must maintain a capital conservation buffer on top of its minimum riskbased capital requirements this buffer must consist solely of tier common equity but the buffer applies to all three riskbased measurements cet1 tier capital and total capital the capital conservation buffer was phased in incrementally over time and became fully effective for us on january resulting in the following effective minimum capital plus capital conservation buffer ratios i a cet1 capital ratio of ii a tier riskbased capital ratio of and iii a total riskbased capital ratio of on december the federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule to revise their regulatory capital rules to i address the upcoming implementation of a new credit impairment model the current expected credit loss or cecl model an accounting standard under gaap ii provide an optional threeyear phasein period for the dayone adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting cecl and iii require the use of cecl in stress tests beginning with the capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations that are subject to stress testing estimating our allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of management judgement and our process for determining an appropriate allowance may result in a range of estimates for expected credit losses we are currently finalizing the support for our best estimate within the range of expected credit losses in order to record a onetime cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings resulting from recording our allowance for credit losses as of the beginning of the first quarter of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective for the current estimate of our allowance for credit losses and the magnitude of our onetime cumulative adjustment to retained earnings and overall impact of the new standard on our business financial condition or results of operations please refer to note 1summary of significant accounting policies recent accounting and regulatory pronouncements under item financial statements and supplementary data prompt corrective action as an insured depository institution the bank is required to comply with the capital requirements promulgated under the fdia and the prompt corrective action regulations thereunder which set forth five capital categories each with specific regulatory consequences under these regulations the categories are table start well capitalized the institution exceeds the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure a wellcapitalized institution i has total riskbased capital ratio of or greater ii has a tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater iii has a common equity tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater iv has a leverage capital ratio of or greater and v is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure table endtable start adequately capitalized the institution meets the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure no capital distribution may be made that would result in the institution becoming undercapitalized an adequately capitalized institution i has a total riskbased capital ratio of or greater ii has a tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater iii has a common equity tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater and iv has a leverage capital ratio of or greater table endtable start undercapitalized the institution fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure an undercapitalized institution i has a total riskbased capital ratio of less than ii has a tier riskbased capital ratio of less than iii has a common equity tier riskbased capital ratio of less than or iv has a leverage capital ratio of less than table endtable start significantly undercapitalized the institution is significantly below the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure a significantly undercapitalized institution i has a total riskbased capital ratio of less than ii has a tier riskbased capital ratio of less than iii has a common equity tier riskbased capital ratio of less than or iv has a leverage capital ratio of less than table endtable start critically undercapitalized the institution fails to meet a critical capital level set by the appropriate federal banking agency a critically undercapitalized institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than table end if the applicable federal regulator determines after notice and an opportunity for hearing that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition the regulator is authorized to reclassify the institution to the next lower capital category other than critically undercapitalized and require the submission of a plan to correct the unsafe or unsound condition if the institution is not well capitalized it cannot accept brokered deposits without prior fdic approval even if approved rate restrictions will govern the rate the institution may pay on the brokered deposits in addition a bank that is less than wellcapitalized generally cannot offer an effective yield in excess of basis points over the national rate as defined below paid on deposits including brokered deposits if approval is granted for the bank to accept them of comparable size and maturity the national rate is defined as a simple average of rates paid by insured depository institutions and branches for which data are available and is published weekly by the fdic institutions subject to the restrictions that believe they are operating in an area where the rates paid on deposits are higher than the national rate can use the local market to determine the prevailing rate if they seek and receive a determination from the fdic that it is operating in a highrate area regardless of the determination institutions must use the national rate to determine conformance for all deposits outside their market area moreover if the institution becomes less than adequately capitalized it must adopt a capital restoration plan acceptable to the fdic the institution also would become subject to increased regulatory oversight and is increasingly restricted in the scope of its permissible activities each company having control over an undercapitalized institution also must provide a limited guarantee that the institution will comply with its capital restoration plan except under limited circumstances consistent with an accepted capital restoration plan an undercapitalized institution may not grow an undercapitalized institution may not acquire another institution establish additional branch offices or engage in any new line of business unless it is determined by the appropriate federal banking agency to be consistent with an accepted capital restoration plan or unless the fdic determines that the proposed action will further the purpose of prompt corrective action the appropriate federal banking agency may take any action authorized for a significantly undercapitalized institution if an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails in any material respect to implement a plan accepted by the agency a critically undercapitalized institution is subject to having a receiver or conservator appointed to manage its affairs and for loss of its charter to conduct banking activities an insured depository institution may not pay a management fee to a bank holding company controlling that institution or any other person having control of the institution if after making the payment the institution would be undercapitalized in addition an institution cannot make a capital distribution such as a dividend or other distribution that is in substance a distribution of capital to the owners of the institution if following such a distribution the institution would be undercapitalized as of december the bank was deemed to be well capitalized payment of dividends south state is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies which expresses the federal reserve boards view that a bank holding company generally should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the holding companys net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding companys capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition the federal reserve board has also indicated that a bank holding company should not maintain a level of cash dividends that places undue pressure on the capital of its bank subsidiaries or that can be funded only through additional borrowings or other arrangements that undermine the bank holding companys ability to act as a source of strength funds for cash distributions to our shareholders are derived primarily from dividends received from our bank our bank is subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends any restriction on the ability of our bank to pay dividends will indirectly restrict the ability of south state to pay dividends to our shareholders the approval of the scbfi is required for the bank to pay dividends that exceeds of net income in any calendar year in addition federal bank regulators have stated that paying dividends that deplete a banking organizations capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally only pay dividends out of current earnings w e and the bank must also maintain the cet1 capital conservation buffer of to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions including dividends as described above the ability of south state and the bank to pay dividends may also be affected by the various minimum capital requirements and the capital and noncapital standards established under the fdicia as described above the right of south state its shareholders and its creditors to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of its subsidiary is further subject to the prior claims of creditors of our bank volcker rule section of the doddfrank act known as the volcker rule generally prohibits any bank bank holding company or affiliate referred to collectively as banking entities from engaging in two types of activities proprietary trading and the ownership or sponsorship of certain private equity or hedge funds that are referred to as covered funds proprietary trading is in general trading in securities on a shortterm basis for a banking entitys own account funds subject to the ownership and sponsorship prohibition generally include those not required to register with the sec because they have only qualified purchasers or no more than investors in december our primary federal regulators the federal reserve board and the fdic together with other federal banking agencies the sec and the commodity futures trading commission finalized a regulation to implement the volcker rule at december we evaluated our securities portfolio and determined that we do not hold any covered funds certain transactions by the company and its affiliates various legal limitations restrict the bank from lending or otherwise supplying funds to south state or its nonbank subsidiaries south state and the bank are subject to sections and of the federal reserve act and federal reserve regulation w section of the federal reserve act places limits on the amount of loans or extensions of credit by a bank to any affiliate including the holding company and on a banks investments in or certain other transactions with affiliates and on the amount of advances to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations any of affiliates of the bank section also applies to derivative transactions repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions that cause a bank to have credit exposure to an affiliate the aggregate of all covered transactions is limited in amount as to any one affiliate to of the banks capital and surplus and as to all affiliates combined to of the banks capital and surplus furthermore within the foregoing limitations as to amount each covered transaction must meet specified collateral requirements the bank is forbidden to purchase low quality assets from an affiliate section of the federal reserve act among other things prohibits a bank from engaging in certain transactions with certain affiliates unless the transactions are on terms and under circumstances including credit standards that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to such bank or its subsidiaries as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated companies if there are no comparable transactions a banks or one of its subsidiaries affiliate transaction must be on terms and under circumstances including credit standards that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies these requirements apply to all transactions subject to section as well as to certain other transactions the affiliates of a bank include any holding company of the bank any other company under common control with the bank including any company controlled by the same shareholders who control the bank any subsidiary of the bank that is itself a bank any company in which the majority of the directors or trustees also constitute a majority of the directors or trustees of the bank or holding company of the bank any company sponsored and advised on a contractual basis by the bank or an affiliate and any mutual fund advised by a bank or any of the banks affiliates regulation w generally excludes all nonbank and nonsavings association subsidiaries of banks from treatment as affiliates except to the extent that the federal reserve board decides to treat these subsidiaries as affiliates the bank is also subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers directors certain principal shareholders and their related interests extensions of credit include derivative transactions repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending transactions to the extent that such transactions cause a bank to have credit exposure to an insider any extension of credit to an insider must be made on substantially the same terms including interest rates and collateral as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features on december the federal banking agencies issued an interagency statement explaining that such agencies will provide temporary relief from enforcement action against banks or asset managers which become principal shareholders of banks with respect to certain extensions of credit by banks that otherwise would violate regulation o provided the asset managers and banks satisfy certain conditions designed to ensure that there is a lack of control by the asset manager over the bank this temporary relief will apply while the federal reserve board in consultation with the other federal banking agencies considers whether to amend regulation o insurance of deposits the deposits of the bank are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund of the fdic the doddfrank act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks savings associations and credit unions to per account as insurer the fdic imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of and to require reporting by fdic insured institutions it also may prohibit any fdic insured institution from engaging in any activity the fdic determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the insurance fund as an fdicinsured bank our bank must pay deposit insurance assessments to the fdic based on its average total assets minus its average tangible equity our banks assessment rates are currently based on its risk classification ie the level of risk it poses to the fdics deposit insurance fund and institutions classified as higher risk pay assessments at higher rates than institutions that pose a lower risk we exceeded billion in assets on january through the merger with sbfc since our bank has exceeded billion in assets for four consecutive quarters the fdic uses a scorecard system to calculate our assessments that combines regulatory ratings and certain forward looking financial measures intended to assess the risk an institution poses to the fdics deposit insurance fund this has resulted in an increase in the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for fdic insurance the fdic also has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations in addition to the ordinary assessments described above the fdic has the ability to impose special assessments in certain instances for example under the doddfrank act the minimum designated reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund was increased to of the estimated total amount of insured deposits and the fdic adopted rules to impose a surcharge on the quarterly deposit insurance assessments of insured depository institutions deemed to be large institutions generally defined to include banks with total consolidated assets of billion or more for four consecutive quarters to reach the designated reserve ratio on september the deposit insurance fund reached exceeding the statutorily required minimum reserve ratio of on reaching the minimum reserve ratio of fdic regulations provided for two changes to deposit insurance assessments i surcharges on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of billion or more large institutions ceased and ii small banks will receive assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from between and to be applied when the reserve ratio is at or above south state received notice from the fdic that it would receive an assessment credit of approximately million based upon the bank being considered a small bank from july through december along with the assessment credits earned by sbfc and psc before they merged with and into south state in of this credit million was applied to the assessment for the second quarter of received in september and was applied to the assessment for the third quarter of received in december assessment rates are expected to decrease if the reserve ratio increases such that it exceeds in addition fdic insured institutions were required to pay a financing corporation fico assessment to fund the interest on bonds issued to resolve thrift failures in the which expired between and the final fico assessment was collected in march the fdic may terminate the deposit
