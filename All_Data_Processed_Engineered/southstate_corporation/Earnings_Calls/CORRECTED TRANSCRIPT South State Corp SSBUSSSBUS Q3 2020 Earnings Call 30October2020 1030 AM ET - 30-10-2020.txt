longterm but you can clearly see the progress being made in the shortterm progress with technology products efficiency all which have us uniquely positioned for the longterm but most importantly its about having a great team which we are fortunate to have and are continuing to build our board and our management team are united around the opportunities that are ahead of us and our culture is growing in a healthy way that will only make us stronger in years to come john corbetts leadership along this journey has been excellent and i will now turn the call over to john for more insight into the quarter john c corbett chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven thanks robert good morning everyone i hope you and your families are doing well in light of the challenging environment i couldnt be happier with the progress our team is making and the financial results that were producing it was a solid quarter adjusting for merger costs the company produced diluted earnings per share of for a return on tangible equity our preprovision net revenue grew to million for a preprovision return on assets of and tangible book value per share grew at an annualized rate over the highlight for the quarter was clearly the profitability of our mortgage and correspondent banking units we heavily invested in these feebased businesses when treasury rates fell after the brexit vote and now four years later these noninterest income lines of businesses are producing a healthy return on investment two weeks ago we announced another investment into our correspondent banking division with the acquisition of a brokerdealer based in memphis tennessee duncanwilliams is a 51year old family firm led by the son of the founder and its the perfect complement to the fixed income line of business that weve been building for over a decade south state currently serves nearly community banks nationwide and duncanwilliams adds an additional financial institutions to our coverage universe this was a negotiated transaction that steve young and brad jones have been pursuing for a year and a half and we are very excited to welcome duncan and his team to south state while fee income has been remarkably strong we continue to be faced with industrywide loan growth and margin headwinds as we navigate through the pandemic the good news is that our loan pipeline bottomed out in august and is steadily rising every week the pipeline is now higher than the low in august and it continues to grow as our clients become more confident in the future south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2020 asset quality metrics improved considerably during the quarter with loan deferrals declining to just of loans of the of loans currently on deferral half of those are in fact making their interest payments so really only of loans are in full principal and interest deferral and this is the second quarter in a row that we recorded only basis point in chargeoffs as for the merger integration its proceeding on time and on budget and the encouraging thing to me is that the merger integration isnt slowing our forward momentum in the rest of the bank i can definitely feel the south state team leaning forward and eager to go on offense to prove what this new franchise is capable of one area where we continue to improve is the south state digital experience this month under the leadership of renee brooks we rolled out our new website and next month we roll out a new mobile banking app that has been in the works for over a year our team is excited to offer a mobile app that rivals the largest banks in the country for customer functionality and convenience to pay for these digital investments we will be downsizing our branch network by braches this quarter which reduces our branch footprint from branches currently to by yearend which also increases our average deposits per branch to over million and thats up from million a decade ago were also excited about the huge opportunities that are presenting themselves to recruit the very best relationship managers from the largest banks in the southeast south state now has the scale technology and capital markets platform to be the logical alternative for middlemarket bankers looking to make a change away from the turmoil at the largest banks so when i step back and i think about our positioning and the environment that were operating in there are things that we can control and there are things that we cannot control we cant control the path or duration of the covid virus and we cant control the shape of the yield curve what we can control is the million of cost savings to be achieved through a merger and branch consolidation initiatives we can also control our investments into the future investments investments in technology investments in our mortgage and correspondent banking teams that are not dependent on the interest spread and finally we can make investments in top notch relationship managers in the best growth markets in the country so as i think about where this franchise is headed im confident were making the right strategic moves to create value for our owners our team and our communities over the next decade and finally along those lines im happy to share the news that south state has created a new executive level position of director of corporate stewardship ladawn jones a year veteran of our company has accepted the invitation to lead our companys diversity initiatives our college recruiting and management training as well as our esg community development and employee assistance programs everyone at south state is excited for ladawn and his new role and eager to support his leadership as we create a company culture that will be a source of pride for all of us in the years ahead with that ill turn the call over to will to provide more color on the numbers william e matthews chief financial officer south state corporation south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2020 thanks john our net interest margin was on a taxable equivalent basis down basis points from  given the june merger closing date and associated purchase accounting marks and preclosing security sales on the legacy centerstate side the second quarter nim is not entirely an apples to apples comparison nor is the combined business basis margin of from  as it includes the unmarked centerstate balance sheet and income statement for the days of the second quarter prior to closing our margin continues to be negatively impacted by the significant liquidity were carrying billion average for the third quarter if we were to reduce our balance sheet cash and fed funds sold to billion reducing deposit funding accordingly our nim would be approximately basis points higher loan yields of were up basis points from  reflecting a full quarter of the centerstate loan portfolio and the company accretion was million for the quarter and core nim excluding loan accretion was as noted on page of the release we had some measurement period adjustments as we finalized purchase accounting marks including a reduction in the loan discount of million while this improved capital ill remind you that it will reduce future accretion accordingly our loan repricing mix is fixed floating and adjustable our total cost of deposits continues to improve down to basis points for the quarter our cds are relatively short with coming due in  another in the first half of and in the second half of on noninterest income we had a record million in quarterly noninterest income led by our mortgage and correspondent banking capital markets our mortgage team has done a really outstanding job in the midst of a merger of two mortgage teams as well as the pandemic with record volume of billion of which was purchased and strong margins resulting in million in revenue our correspondent banking division continues to show strong results with a million a quarter and on that note id like to echo johns welcome to the duncanwilliams team were not disclosing transaction terms due to the size of this acquisition but were excited about duncan and his group joining brad jones and his team and helping us grow this business as well as the help it should provide in a very low interest rate environment steve has responsibility for these noninterest income businesses and is available to answer questions on them during the qa session on expenses our nie for the quarter was million including million in mergerrelated expenses for an operating nie of million our efficiency ratio was excluding the mergerrelated expenses our expenses for the quarter came in a little better than we expected in part because we have begun to realize some of the merger cost saves thus far a little faster than expected through a normal employee turnover and some departure of employees who will not be retained as well as certain vendor savings we expect that this cost save realization number will continue to increase each quarter with the bulk of the savings coming in particularly  after system conversion additionally our expenses for a number of items were down in  due to covid business development loan related and ore expenses travel expenses and to some extent health insurance costs were all down due to covid but we would expect many of these to normalize once were beyond the health crisis south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2020 so the  run rate for several areas is lower than we would expect in a normal noncovid environment on mergerrelated expenses we have recognized approximately half of the estimated million todate some of which occurred on the centerstate side preclosing turning to credit our net chargeoffs remained very low at for the quarter or basis point annualized ending npas were basis points of assets down basis points from  due to a combination of payoffs and upgrades our provision for credit losses was million for the quarter million of which was for the reserve for unfunded commitments liability after running two separate legacy bank cecl models and combining the results in  we consolidated onto one model in the third quarter and this consolidation of the legacy south state loans onto a different model resulted in the increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments for economic assumptions we use the moodys baseline forecast that forecast has the unemployment rate for the south atlantic region holding at for  and  of this year before starting to decrease in with a forecast of at yearend and at yearend with a provision expense of almost million and net chargeoffs of less than million our reserve coverage excluding ppp loans grew to basis points including the reserve for unfunded commitments or basis points just including the reserve for funded loans this brings the allowance to npls to just under times slide outlines our loss absorption capacity ratio which ended the quarter at basis points as john said our deferrals reduced significantly since our last update dropping below at october additionally our full pi deferrals were only of that date as almost half of the deferrals are paying interest for the effective tax rate our return to profitability in  after the impact of the double count provision and other merger expenses in  caused our effective tax rate to decline in the third quarter to from the second quarters turning to capital with good profitability and a flat though still somewhat inflated balance sheet our capital ratios grew during the quarter our tce ratio grew basis points ending at our cet1 and total riskbased ratios grew by approximately basis points and basis points respectively ending at and our ending tangible book value per share was just shy of at up from  and up from the year ago quarter ill turn it back to you john john c corbett chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven all right as a reminder we are conducting this call from different locations so its going to be helpful if you direct your questions to the person that youd like to respond this concludes our prepared remarks and id like to ask the operator to open the call for questions south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2020 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions operator instructions our first question comes from michael rose with raymond james please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everyone and thanks for taking my questions i wanted to just circle back to expense as well you guys had obviously some really good revenue generation this quarter and the expenses were down i understand some of it is covidrelated but can you just help us from a run rate perspective as the economy continues to reopen hopefully what are some of the specific addbacks we should think about and if you can just remind us how much of the cost saves im sorry if i missed it how much of the cost saves so far youve actually realized thanks william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation sure michael we would on the latter part of the question we would estimate that thus far we have recognized on an annualized basis run rate about to of the million of cost saves so call that million for a quarter i think in the quarter like i said we had we dont have people out there doing business development efforts so theres a lot less travel going on theres not much real estate foreclosure activity in those related expenses and professional expenses associated with that those areas are all down and i think for a lot of us are not going to the doctor like we as often as we had so were seeing a little bit of decline in health insurance and id say all of those items combined relative to a more normalized quarter might be million or so in a quarter roughly and then so thats why i just wanted to be clear that while were pleased that nie was down to million this is an unusual environment and didnt want to people over interpret that as they look forward michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc thats very helpful and then maybe just switching to the core margin i know theres some moving parts in there first full quarter postintegration as we think about going forward i mean are there other areas that you guys are working on to kind of optimize the balance sheet and then how does that relate to the ability to prevent or limit nim compression from here thanks stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation sure michael its steve let me just kind of talk about a little bit in the broader context around revenue we talked about on page we have a slide in the deck that talks about our revenue composition over the past four quarters and what you see in there is the revenue composition has changed a year ago we were about nim fees now were fees nim so just wanted to draw your attention to that our reported margin as will mentioned was our core margin at just a couple of things on that we are core deposit funded bank in great markets our checking accounts make up of deposits and our total cost of deposits this quarter was actually basis points so we continue to grow low cost deposits on our retail south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2020 our small business and our treasury platform but from a margin perspective we dont have a lot of room to reduce costs but we will go as low as we can without cutting at the core let me kind of speak through the components of margin first on the yield on the loan portfolio ex ppp and accretion this quarter was 416were putting new loan production yields this quarter in that million so that continues to be a headwind as it relates to wills comment on the excess liquidity so we have about billion of average fed funds sold its probably about billion over a target it weighed on our margin about basis points this quarter if you look at our premerger our total investment portfolio was right about billion or around of assets right prior to close we sold billion of the centerstate portfolio because it was going to be marktomarket around so as we think about the future of that excess liquidity we invested about billion this quarter to get it to around billion were likely on a path to get it closer to billion by the end of the year and then mediumterm our target for the investment portfolio is around of assets thatll depend upon liquidity itll depend on yield curve but we also want to make sure that were not investing a bunch of capital in the lowest rate environment weve seen so we are cautious on that particularly as the noninterest income businesses have been performing one last comment on the securities portfolio it was at this quarter and were adding purchases somewhere so that would be the core margin comments the only other comment was on accretion i think we had million this quarter of course that was elevated wed expect that to decrease from here we have a disclosure in the earnings release that shows theres about million of discount left on the acquired loans so with that why i dont i turn it over to will if he have any other comments there william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation yeah i think i just would reiterate a couple of things to make sure that we emphasize and one is just the reminder steve gave about the marking of the centerstate portfolio in  and the impacts we had so you basically had a couple of billion dollar bond portfolio half of which is sold and turned into cash at basis points and half of which you had to mark down to a yield of about half of what it was earning before so thats the impact but the second is probably more important and that is just our longterm focus and trying to make sure the decisions we make are ones that were going to like for the longterm it would certainly be easy to ph boost earnings a bit if we took that excess cash of billion and invested it to pick up basis points basis points over where we are earning today at the fed but we want to be thoughtful and do that over time and not get aggressive and then regret that nine months or a year down the road if rates have moved back up so well be thoughtful about pulling that lever although it does exist michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay all that color is helpful so i think the way to read that is maybe core margin ex ppp and ex accretion income probably going to see some pressure here but you guys are making some investments the loan portfolio and the pipelines that you mentioned will continue to grow so maybe we get to a point where nii actually troughs on a core basis ex ppp and accretion sometime next year and then starts to build from there is that kind of the messaging and the way to think about it south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2020 stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation and michael this is steve i think thats a fair way i think the tailwind will be any of our investment purchases the headwind is the loan book until it gets closer to par and with elections and covid and all those the yields are going to move around a lot but thats how were thinking about it michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc clearly understood thanks for taking my questions operator our next question comes from steven scouten with piper sandler please go ahead stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning everyone john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven hi steven stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co morning so maybe just want to get some clarification on the expenses i want to make sure i heard it correctly on the branch reductions it sounds as though thats incremental to the cost saves related to the deal but that more or less its going to get we wont see net savings due to investments in digital and other technology investments is that correct i kind of interpret that right william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation yes steven i think john can elaborate further but its hard to separate out between the merger cost saves we have as well as the additional investments were making in digital and the branch reduction and so we our million goal includes all three of those both the reduction in expenses from the branch reductions as well as the additional investments were making in improving our technology and really its more of a reallocation of the branch rationalization into the digital spend would be the way i would probably describe it john you may have some better comments john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven i think you nailed it will i dont have anything to add stephen kendall q scouten analyst piper sandler co south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2020 perfect and then how would we think about maybe i dont know a variable comp percentage on mortgage with mortgage being so elevated how do we think about maybe how thats represented in salaries kind of in this quarter and the quarters to come assuming that does kind of trickle down maybe with mba forecasts next year how we can think about the impact on salaries and maybe efficiency ratio that you think about in that business on a variable basis william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation yeah why dont i start and steve maybe you can comment on the efficiency ratio side so two components to compensation expense and mortgage obviously one is the staff to get all of the loans through the system and that obviously the need for support staff in an environment like this is greater than it is in a lower volume environment but with respect to the variable comp associated with the mortgages accounting guidance dictates that you offset against the revenue so its fas so the cost of originating that loan ie the commission is a revenue offset and again indiscernible margin now i will admit to you that not weve looked at all our peers not everyone does it the exact same way but we do it that way and thats the way we understand the accounting guidance from the time we spent discussing with a number of accounting firms so thats a component that probably lacks some comparability when you look at other companies some other companies i should say stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation yeah and steven id just to your point mortgage for the industry had a great quarter we are really super proud of our group the integration of those teams ph tom brent and stephens leadership theyre just doing a great job of integrating this team so the production was very large but the gain on sale is very large so if you think about efficiency ratios i would expect that over time that margin which are a record at every company right now would move back toward even though the production as we think about these historical levels may move back over time yeah hopefully that kind of helps guide you through the efficiency obviously is really good right now because the margins are so large the margins will come in and our volume will come down a little bit stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it okay and then just maybe last one for me as it pertains to growth and maybe this is kind of a john question but maybe also someone else it looks like there was maybe a big migration from the acquired book into the nonacquired book im just or maybe not and maybe if you can comment on that the big reduction in acquired noncredit impaired and then just kind of with the pipelines building how you think about net growth in this environment which obviously is a little tenuous still at best i guess i should say so just kind of commentary there would be helpful john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven yeah ill comment on the first question and will chime in to clean up my accounting knowledge but i think steven you talked about a decline in the acquired book and a rise in the nonacquired book i mean remember how this works the acquired book only runs off you never had to it so all of the centerstate loans that came in under the fair market value accounting they only decline and all of the loans that are being generated by both south state and legacy centerstate all of that goes into nonacquired so i think youll continue to see that mix where one portfolio is going down the other one is going to have to see outsized growth because now its got double the production south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2020 but from a growth standpoint weve had a pretty volatile two quarters here so hard to be precise in forecasting but let me see if i can unpack the components for you a little bit here and i think its important to separate the commercial portfolio from the residential portfolio and ill start with the residential if you look at our residential and home equity book at the end of the second quarter we saw million decline so it annualized out to like well on the same token we had a record residential production of billion so we had million runoff but yet we produced billion well the economics as steve mention of this gain on sale being at is just unprecedented so it really doesnt make sense for us from an alco perspective to put on 30year fixed rate loans on our books at the right thing to do for alco standpoint the right thing to do for our clients is to move those loans to the secondary market so that has been a headwind residential to our loan portfolio but its not been a headwind to the income statement in totality on the commercial side the way id have you think about that is recognize that a commercial loan pipeline is a 90day pipeline so loans you close in the third quarter are typically loans where they enter the pipeline in the second quarter so what was the pipeline in the second quarter was dead so its not it doesnt surprise us that total commercial portfolio would be down in the third quarter but having said that within the commercial portfolio we were encouraged that we were up the ci portfolio was up during the quarter and owner occupied commercial real estate was up in the quarter so its important to think about those components but as you think forward about the pipeline the pipeline is climbing now between million and million a week and let me step back and put it in perspective for you precovid at the end of the first quarter the pipeline was billion we hit a low in august at billion since that low in august the pipelines back up to billion so a increase in the pipeline and were feeling good that thats going to translate into the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year into increased production dont think its going to be any kind of rapid growth in the loan portfolio but i think we will turn the corner and start seeing some modest growth stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co great thanks for all the color and congrats on a very good quarter and a lot of progress already congrats john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven thank you william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation thank you operator our next question comes from kevin fitzsimmons with da davidson please go ahead kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co hey good morning everyone south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2020 john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven hey kevin william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation good morning kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co just wondering on correspondent banking given the strength the full quarter impact of that coming in and the business doing well but also the acquisition that you guys announced just curious what how sustainable you view that pace of revenues going forward just any kind of seasonal or cyclical forces we should be aware of but also with the deal are there other bolton deals like this you guys are looking at in that area thanks stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation sure thank you kevin this is steve one of the things id just remind us i mean that we really like the diversification of these fee income businesses if you think about mortgage correspondent capital markets and wealth none of those businesses make up over more than of our total revenue so we like the diversification within each line as it relates to the correspondent group if you look at the trailing months under brads leadership the division has done about million or so of revenue if you look at the components of that about million of it is in fixed income about million in our capital markets product and million in payments so as you think about the future i would think that the record year of million in our capital markets business likely with loan volume and the industry being where probably will be next year wed expect that to come off a little bit call it just like mortgage probably will but just to go into duncanwilliams as we talked about already duncan williams has about financial institution clients you put that with our thats about financial institutions last year in duncan reported about million in revenue and just from a modeling perspective as we model the deal we typically try to run these noncapital intensive businesses around the efficiency ratio business so hopefully thats helpful in your modeling so if you think about the pluses and minuses going into next year i think youre going to see some of the capital markets activity likely decline a little bit but with the opportunity to increase relative to our fixed income opportunity with our own group as well as duncanwilliams and the replacement of revenue there and then i think longterm i think were just excited to see the synergies between the two teams as we have products and services from both groups that eventually we can cross sell into it clearly thats not going to happen in the next six months but thats the longterm approach so hopefully thats helpful for you kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co thats great steve thanks appreciate that color just one other broader question about reserve build i appreciate all the detail at the level youve taken the reserve ratio to and then more broadly when you look at loss absorption as you guys are describing it so that being said if net chargeoffs are staying low as they are south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2020 and we dont get any real big change in some of the economic indicators for your cecl model should we assume reserve build is mostly in the rear view for you guys or is it if we still think there are losses coming its just theyre not coming yet they maybe will be later next year it still may make sense for you all to incrementally build in the next few quarters thanks william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation yeah kevin ill start and if dan or anybody else wants to jump in and theyd certainly do so but the thing about cecl of course and its interesting that we all implemented this new life of loan model life of and shortly before hitting this pandemic but the theory behind it is that we reserve fully for the economic forecast the losses that would be driven by these economic forecast and lost drivers in your model over that forecast period in which case that theory would tell you that today youve got every dollar in your reserve that you need and that should be true of everyone whos adopted cecl absent a change in that forecast so forecasting from there if the economic forecasts dont worsen then our reserves should be adequate now theres a lot of cloudiness to the crystal ball right now with what appears to be increases in covid cases and who knows what thats going to do to some of the forecasts of unemployment and other loss drivers going forward but sitting today the way the cecl model is supposed to work we should be fine i mentioned in my comments the model change so given the timing of our closing we had to do really a sum of the parts methodology for june you couldnt really convert over to a new model and go through the model validation process before then and so when we did consolidate this quarter thats what drove the majority of the provision expense the million of it was based on the different methodology for the reserve unfunded commitments so absent that the quarters provision expense would have been million or million in terms a loss validation dan you might want to comment sort of on kevins question about where we think losses in the industry are heading in the future daniel e bockhorst a executive vice president chief credit officer centerstate bank na winter haven yeah just from a future loss perspective the last two quarters have been very good from a chargeoff perspective and i dont anticipate any material change in that here in the fourth quarter its more first second third quarter depending upon how kind of the pandemic plays out and what impact that may have in the future on credit but right now npas chargeoffs et cetera credit looks strong kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co okay thank you guys operator our next question comes from catherine mealor with kbw please go ahead catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven good morning south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2020 william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation good morning catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc want to followup on the asset quality you mentioned in your slide deck that classifieds increase this quarter can you just give us a little bit of color around the categories that drove that increase this quarter john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven dan do you want to take that daniel e bockhorst a executive vice president chief credit officer centerstate bank na winter haven yeah dan bockhorst ill take that question the pandemic credit economic headwinds that put a lot of loans on deferral in  and  and as good risk managers we did a comprehensive review with the credit administrators and market presidents in august of all of our loans over million that were either in highrisk categories were on deferral as a result of this review we made changes to the risk rating grades so that we could ensure that we have the appropriate allowance and also acknowledge the impact that the economic headwinds have had on some of the borrowers clearly there is more stress in the hotel book across the entire industry and so thats whats driving these numbers primarily and make up the majority of the classified and criticize recognizing the headwinds there the severity of any loss is mitigated by the approximate pcd mark on the legacy centerstate bank loans plus the overall ltv in the hotel portfolio from where we are today if the economy continues this rate a recovery or we dont anticipate any material change in the level of criticizer are classified assets in the immediate future quarters catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great and on the hotel book any kind of update on what youre seeing in some of your properties in terms of occupancy rates and maybe kind of the difference between what you saw this past quarter in your coastal properties versus some of your metro markets daniel e bockhorst a executive vice president chief credit officer centerstate bank na winter haven yeah the hotel bookings is performing better than we anticipated about twothirds of the portfolio is in leisure segment vacation areas coastal waterways that are destinations within driving distance of a large segment of the southeast population and the summer was fairly good occupancy levels in those categories exceeded and in some cases were greater than so when you combine that with deferrals and the ppp funds so with this improved performance allowed a lot of these borrowers to stabilize and build some liquidity as well as theyve adjusted expenses to better operate in this environment the business segment which makes up about onethird has seen occupancy levels typically in the low to mid range some might be a little bit lower those are the ones that are struggling a little bit more and have a little bit more headwinds south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2020 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay very helpful and then maybe one other question on just big picture capital thoughts a lot of banks are starting to talk about buybacks i dont think many banks of your size will start buybacks this year but how are you thinking about what youre looking for to be able to start to think about reengaging in the buyback activity as we move into next year thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven hey catherine its john maybe i can comment and will feel free to chime in a lot of uncertainty this summer plus in our situation were putting two large balance sheets together i wanted to see where this capital ratio shook out we did raise some subdebt in the second quarter of the year to bolster the capital position if you look at us we look pretty good relative to our peers on cet1 and total riskbased capital the one ratio thats a little bit lower is tangible common equity i think it ended the quarter around if we keep profitability somewhere where its at today that should exceed headed into so if credit is as benign in as were feeling like it might be now that having that extra capital getting tce back above i feel like it gives us some optionality to look at a buyback right now the dividend i think its yielding about were paying back about a third of the earnings i feel pretty good where the dividend is but i think that the growing capital base capital formation is going to give us some options going into catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you congrats on a great quarter john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven thank you william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation thank you operator our next question comes from brody preston with stephens please go ahead brody preston q analyst stephens inc hey good morning everyone john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven good morning south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2020 william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation morning brody preston q analyst stephens inc i just wanted to circle back on the expenses real quick so appreciate the million or so in business development that sort of not in the quarterly run rate right now but and correct me if im wrong theoretically that should have also been somewhat missing from the sort of pro forma run rate of million just given the world was still lockdown at that point or just coming out of a lockdown and so i guess its still really good cost savings you mentioned the million or so from the ssb csfl sort of cost savings and so i guess was there anything else that you all sort of did that drove the larger sort of reduction in expenses this quarter william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation so brody its will let me clean up a little bit just to make sure so that million i mentioned that was more than just business development it was included ore loanrelated foreclosure related all those kind of expenses and included professional fee reductions not all related sort of activity levels being lighter and i will say on the business develop and thats but this is  versus  and i think part of this  you probably have some  expenses ie employee credit card or stuff like that that are those bills are received and paid in  so thats probably a little bit of noise there in terms so the full million was not business development just to be clear on that i would say  had probably a little higher expenses associated with our covid reaction just getting things geared up in terms of responding with our facilities and things like that so that was a little bit of a i think that would be a decline from  to  but i just my comments were just to try to give you a little more clarity on it feels to me like million is not a permanent run rate given the unusual environment in which were operating in and if we move back to a more normalized environment were going to be out calling on customers greg lapointe and his team are going to be hitting the road and spending some money on the business development side foreclosure activity is going to come back ph in an industry some expense well spend a little more money on that so i just i kind of want to just make sure that idea was out there brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven and id just add to that i mean we shared in the deck the combined business basis the expenses there and if you think about sometimes our fee revenue businesses move these expenses up and down on the variable side our revenue was up on the fee income by about i think million million a lot of that related to an msr adjustment south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2020 so if you think about the variability of the fee income that really ph was it from a commission perspective much difference in quarter two and quarter three so the quarter two expenses would be on a combined basis outside of our cost saves would be pretty reflective of the run rate where were at so sometimes the fee income does move that around a little bit but really in the third quarter it did not so hopefully that helpful commentary too brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay all right understood thank you for that and then on ppp i think youve mentioned that you have billion still on the balance sheet i wanted to get a sense for the timing of that but then also could you i dont know if youve looked at this at all but do you have any sense for how much of those deposits are still sitting on the balance sheet william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation ill start by saying brody that with respect to ppp our crystal ball is probably more cloudy than some of the other commentary ive heard folks give but what ill say what we know we have about of our loans in the forgiveness process indiscernible forgiveness process during the quarter we recognized about million of the net fees ppp fee leaving us about million i think remaining at the end of the quarter it is really hard to tell when that forgiveness process will really kick into gear how quickly the sba will respond will there be another bill passed postelection that may include some sort of forgiveness but i would say our rough expectation with all those qualifiers is youre probably looking at a  and  concentration and i dont know at this point whether its more heavily in  or  but that would be our best guess today i dont have a figure for you on how much of those deposits are still on the balance thats a good question but john or steve may have a feel for that stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation yeah brody this is steve id just point we dont know the exact answer but i mean its pretty obvious when you look at the big picture on page of the deck which shows the deposits from the first quarter to the second quarter and what you see is billion deposit growth there and thats when all the ppp money was going out and were flat from there so the way i would characterize it as yeah the deposit from those companies although we dont have a specific answer really havent spread out yet and our deposits are flat after that big ramp in  brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay understood i guess im just trying to think about the potential deployment of excess liquidity and so youve got billion and sort of excess liquidity like you said on the balance sheet but i guess just thinking about the deployment of that either into loans or securities throughout i guess as those ppp deposits flow out i guess that would sort of flow out with it or do you i guess do you estimate that you sort of have excess liquidity still on the balance sheet that can be deployed into earning assets beyond the ppp deposits stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation yeah brody i think the answer is we dont know i think what our target if you look at our companies as separate companies we ran our investment portfolios of assets thats how weve traditionally done it when south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2020 we had a lot of excess liquidity in the financial crisis we probably ran it closer to but i think right now were in the wait and see mode we need to build the securities book back up to that medium term number and then see where the landscape is and see how those ppp funds because i do think its uncertain and we just want to be thoughtful as we do it william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation okay and i would add i would say steve i would also just add to that that while certainly a portion of the excess liquidity is ppp its also just the liquidity that the fed has pumped into the economy and some of those ppp loan fundings have been used to pay payroll and things like that but i think theres just an excessive amount of liquidity thats with us right now based on the actions the fed has taken over and above the ppp brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay understood and on duncanwilliams thanks for giving the million in revenue last year just want to get a sense for their business has i guess been negatively impacted this year as a result of covid or how theyve been faring yeartodate stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation yeah we wont give those public numbers but just ill talk about our fixed income business our fixed income business is up this year and its really primarily because theres just more excess liquidity sitting in the financial space so as you think about all the excess liquidity were talking about it needs to be invested at some point so do our clients and so i think even though financial institutions like ours have been pretty hesitant to go too fast on this at some point next year or the year after youll start seeing that deployed so i think this is another good business to be in the hedging with because i think the fixed income revenue probably be a little stronger than that but its probably too early to tell brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay and then the million or so in loan discount is that the total discount or is there something else beyond to that william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation thats the total brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay and so just wanted to ask so it was million in paa loan accretion income this quarter i guess just thinking about the quarterly run rate moving forward understood that its supposed to step down but what should the quarterly run rate on paa look like perhaps for and when do you sort of expect those loan discounts to be fully accreted into income john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2020 will you want to take that william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation well i was hoping you would steve im chuckling really i hope you understand why if youd asked me three months ago i would not have come i would not have guessed million its just a hard number to predict based upon when payoffs occur pay downs occur and things like that but its clearly going to it should decline from here and you model it over the weighted average life of that portfolio but then the weighted average life ends up being in my experience over years of acquisitions always ends up being shorter than what you had modeled but if i were to throw out a number for you i would worry that i would be doing that number with more precision than would be appropriate given the difficulty but if you know the best way to do is just model whatever you think the weighted average life would be for that acquired portfolio and that would sort of guide you to a number but i wish i could give you a better number but i really dont feel comfortable doing so brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay do you know the weighted average life off the top of your head william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation i do not actually i dont but the type of lending we do and again this would be from origination date the type of lending we do you generally think about it being that three or five year range but stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation yeah will id say for the centerstate book prior to merger it was around years was the average life so i think that is probably a decent point brody preston q analyst stephens inc all right great thank you for taking my questions everyone i appreciate it william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation thank you operator our next question comes from christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott please go ahead christopher w marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks good morning thank you for the color on the problem assets on the prior calls i just want to drill down to the kind of classified and criticized trends just to understand do you see a path where those loans get upgraded in the next couple of quarters or do you think its going to be more sort of stagnant for a while get more visibility on the recession covid et cetera and then those will migrate back later south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2020 john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven dan daniel e bockhorst a executive vice president chief credit officer centerstate bank na winter haven yeah this is daniel bockhorst i think a little bit of combination of both i do think theres an opportunity for some of those classified loans to get upgraded sooner than later and then the ones that are in that criticized category probably a little bit maybe longer path a six months to nine months to see those start to get upgraded as we get a little bit more visibility but i dont anticipate those to also i dont anticipate those to migrate and get downgraded christopher w marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got it thats helpful so again the reserve build really kind of counts all that into effect now as of these downgrades daniel e bockhorst a executive vice president chief credit officer centerstate bank na winter haven correct christopher w marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got it okay thanks for that dan and then just a followup for whomever on the ppp what are you seeing on fraud is that an issue to worry about do you need to set aside reserves for that even if its not material at this point william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation the fact that it hasnt really been a conversation in any of our various risk meetings or whatnot would lead me to answer chris that its really not a factor for us and ill knock on some wood as i say that but i think weve built some pretty good processes and had involvement of the local teams which is a strength of our company throughout that process so hopefully we would be less subject to that than others i dont think weve seen much of that john or steve do you have a and dan do you all have a better answer john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven this is john i think ive asked that question and so far im receiving confidence back that theyre not seeing trends of fraud so its still early but thats what we hear now christopher w marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great i appreciate that thanks again for all the time this morning south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2020 john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven you bet william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation thank you chris operator operator instructions our next question comes from jennifer demba with truist please go ahead jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven good morning jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc i think all the topics have really been covered but ill ask one more you announced another branches youre cutting can you just talk about your willingness to reduce more branches or corporate real estate thats not currently planned right now in order to offset revenue challenges should there be any john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven yeah jennifer its john with our merger there really wasnt branch overlap so i think both companies in the past have acquired a lot of banks with branch overlap and weve put branches together but setting that aside there is this secular trend and i think youre seeing this history with both companies that each year looking to rationalize branch network in fact if you go back over the last decade theres a slide page of that deck if you take the two companies put them together there were about branches a decade ago weve acquired branches but weve consolidated so weve consolidated about half of everything that weve purchased so this has been an ongoing trend and we think that that will continue to be an ongoing trend youve heard other folks talk jennifer about the covid driving more and more digital adoption interesting we opened all of our branches in the company this month theyve been closed for i think since march so call it six months that the office has been closed we opened this month ive talked to some of the presidents and said well now that were open whats happened with the traffic inside they said remarkably slow that customers have become accustomed to doing business in the drive thru doing business digitally and they are the traffic has not picked up considerably in the lobbies now that were open on the digital side just some stats for you yearoveryear digital deposits are up a year ago this is people taking a picture of their check on their telephone we were doing about of our deposits ph and right now its as far as actually opening new checking accounts online thats up yearoveryear it was of our accounts a year ago now its of our accounts and consumer loans opening up online is up yearoveryear a year ago it was about of our consumer loan now its south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2020 so i think as we think about the future well continue to evaluate the rotation of brick and mortar expense into digital expense on the other corporate real estate front when we did the merger and we analyzed our operations center space weve got two major operations centers one in charleston with a few hundred people and one in winter haven florida with a few hundred people but in actuality we have total operation centers so theres smaller ones well thats those support teams have been working from home for six months and its been working fine so i think its very likely that as we go through this efficiency project with the merger that we may see a significant reduction in a number of those smaller operation centers these are secular trends youre hearing from others and definitely theres a lever for us to continue to pull on a yearbyyear basis jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc one more question john do you think your revenue producers are as productive working from home as they are working from the office john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven yeah good question i mean our two quarters here our loan production is down so you got to say well is that because the revenue producers arent as productive or is that because the economy got shutdown so id like to believe that that there is productive i mean let me answer it a different way go back to the ppp process okay the economy was shut down there they were working from home we did loans in a period of about i want to say it was like three weeks so i think thats the case study ppp that the ability to be productive is there at least in that kind of crisis moment but i think our relationship managers love to get in front of their clients so i think thats slowly starting to open up in the long term youd probably going to see a mix of inperson and also more digital contacts good news is on the rm front were having a lot of success now recruiting and theres a lot of turmoil in the biggest banks so its a new world were all trying to figure out how much time to spend in front of a zoom call and how much time to spend inperson stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation jennifer id just add anecdotally on some of these fee lines of business whether it be mortgage fixed income capital markets theyre all working remotely and having record production so i think the ability to get in front of clients is a little harder but at the same time i think were all figure it out that you can do some of this more remotely so i think theres pluses and minuses out of both of them jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thats great color thank you operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to john corbett for any closing remarks john c corbett chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven all right thanks thanks a lot these are great questions and i hope weve been able to provide some clarity this morning were going to be participating in the piper sandler conference in a couple of weeks but in the south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2020 meantime if you have any questions as you update your models please feel free to reach out
