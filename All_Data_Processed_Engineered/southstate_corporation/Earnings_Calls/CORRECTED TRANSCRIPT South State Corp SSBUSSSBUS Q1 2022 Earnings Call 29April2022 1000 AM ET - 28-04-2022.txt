transcript  earnings call 29apr2022 robert r hill jr executive chairman south state corp good morning and thank you for joining the south state earnings call our results for the first quarter showed progress in many areas as you will hear from john and will the area where i see the most excitement as we start this year is in the energy created by our teams gathering again in person we have held events across our company this quarter that brought our people together these events have been a welcome opportunity to spend time face to face with each other you can see the power of personal relationships that are being rekindled and in some cases just beginning our team has been amazing working through unprecedented circumstances and to see them so excited to be together again is exhilarating these relationships are the magic they create a high performing bank and to see this reunion is a welcome sign of the potential of south state ill now turn the call over to john corbett john c corbett chief executive officer director south state corp thank you robert good morning everybody and i hope you and your families are doing well the economy in the southeast continues to thrive its incredibly strong we continue to see population migration from all over the country and construction activity is very brisk and keep in mind this follows a decade of slower construction after the housing crisis our shipping ports airports theme parks hotels and restaurants are all near record capacity as consumers return to their prepandemic lifestyles and covid really hasnt been an economic constraint over the last year with the favorable political environment in the southeast but our clients are struggling with labor shortages and wage pressure to meet the spike in consumer demand we released our earnings last night and reported earnings per share of when you exclude merger related expenses our adjusted earnings per share landed at yielding a return on tangible common equity of approximately the operating results were solid across the board with healthy loan and deposit growth excluding accretion we had million of core margin growth this quarter and good expense control asset quality metrics continue to be excellent i know the market gets spooked about a recession when the yield curve inverts but as we get on the street level and we meet face to face with our clients when we review their cash balances and their unfunded lines of credit were pretty bullish on the strength and resilience of our clients over this next year we closed on the atlantic capital acquisition in atlanta on march and were on track for systems conversion in the third quarter the atlantic capital team has delivered excellent balance sheet growth since the announcement last summer and really they havent missed a beat we remain excited about the strategic fit in atlanta and also expanding our new fintech and payments verticals our balance sheet remains liquid and were in perfect position for rising rates during my year banking career i was always taught that the most valuable part of the balance sheet is the right side of the balance sheet and while that principle has certainly been challenged in a zero rate environment that is the mindset that built this company south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2022 over the last two years we felt like our deposit franchise was a coiled spring of earnings power if we could just get the five year treasury back over we currently have million deposit accounts that are diversified and granular and that should lead to a lower deposit beta during the last rate increase cycle our deposit beta was only on the first basis point increase we started this year with of the balance sheet in cash and then continued growing deposits in the first quarter by annualized and thats excluding atlantic capital also our cost of deposits fell another basis point to an alltime low of just basis points we held our nerves and were deliberately patient to hang on to our excess cash during the record low rates of this quarter however we began deploying the cash into the investment portfolio as the yield curve dramatically improved the investment portfolio grew billion during the quarter from billion to billion with about half of that growth attributable to atlantic capital we still ended the quarter with of the balance sheet in cash and only a loan to deposit ratio so we will experience significant revenue improvement as we continue to deploy our surplus cash into this more favorable rate environment our loan production hit billion in the quarter similar to the third quarter and excluding the atlantic capital acquired loan balances our linked quarter annualized loan growth was we continue to believe that rising rates will slow the prepayment speeds and be a tailwind to net loan growth at our current production levels along with our earnings release we announced that we will be modifying our consumer overdraft program we plan to eliminate nsf fees to eliminate transfer fees to cover overdrafts and to introduce a new deposit product with no overdraft fees we estimate that the net impact of these product changes will be about to per share on an annual basis beginning in the third quarter and to wrap up i want to thank our team for their great work over the last quarter and over the last two years when we model the merger of equals between center state and south state and we put it on paper there was no global pandemic in the model there was no recession and interest rates werent at zero but our bankers are tough and theyre leaders and theyve plowed ahead with both grit and grace they worked through the conversion and the integration and now the bank is growing credit quality is pristine and our deposit franchise is incredibly valuable again ill turn it over to will and he can give you additional details on the numbers william e matthews senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp thanks john ill cover some highlights on margin noninterest income and noninterest expense as well as credit and the provision for credit losses in a general sense ill reiterate that were pleased with the quarter and that were enthusiastic about the remainder of the year given what we believe will be a better revenue environment slide shows our net interest margin trends  of was our highest quarter for net interest income excluding accretion up million from  we did have atlantic capital revenue for the month of march but we also had two fewer days in  versus  yields on nonppp loans of were down basis points from  and total accretion in ppp fees of million were down million from the fourth quarter the acbi purchase accounting marks are outlined on slide south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2022 looking ahead the next few quarters we would expect to see accretion run in the million range including acbi for a full quarter cost of total deposits reached basis points for the quarter a new low for us taxable equivalent margin of fell basis point from  with the lower accretion and ppp fee income causing a differential of approximately basis points with the yield curve move in the quarter we deployed some cash in the bond portfolio but we continue to have a lot of dry powder with billion in fed funds roughly of our balance sheet noninterest income of million was down approximately million from  slide shows our mortgage highlights and we had solid production in the quarter at billion as gain on sale margins compress and mortgage rates move up the relative attractiveness of portfolio versus secondary increases for the first quarter of our production went to the secondary market with in the portfolio and construction to perm loans are included in that portfolio number we benefit in this environment from being a purchasefocused mortgage company representing approximately of our production and our servicing business should be better in the higher rate environment but margins in the business are under competitive pressure and are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future our correspondent division had good performance with million in revenue for the quarter as noted on slide our interest rate swaps business experienced good demand but our fixed income business was a bit weaker in spite of the market providing an opportunity to invest cash at higher rates presumably influenced by aoci sticker shock at some of our clients turning to expenses operating nie of million including one month of atlantic capital came in a bit better than budget with good performance pretty much across the board in various expense categories is the first full year after the moe system conversion and our integration continues to progress nicely we also implemented this year an incentive system with division and region level measures meant to drive a culture of ownership department or division level performance versus budget whether in net income for a revenue generating division or an nie for a support area is a meaningful component of incentive pay for we believe this incentive structure will help us continue to maintain a focus on revenue growth and cost control looking ahead well have atlantic capital expenses in our expense base for a full quarter for the remaining three quarters of the year its nie run rate was million per quarter weve achieved some of the cost saves ahead of schedule as some employees have departed before we had modeled so acbis nie run rate in march was slightly lower than we had expected the conversion is scheduled for late july given the addition of acbi for two more months than we had in  we currently foresee nie running in the low for the remaining three quarters of the year possibly on the high for the fourth quarter with atlantic capital cost save realization offset somewhat by annual wage increases and general inflation pressures moving to credit we continue to report strong asset quality metrics slide shows continuing low trends of net chargeoffs nonperforming assets and criticized and classified assets million of the million in net chargeoffs were dda overdraft chargeoffs so loan net charge offs were less than million continued improvement in economic forecasts led us to record a negative provision of million for the quarter or a negative million excluding the day one provision for acquired nonpcd loans at atlantic capital in arriving at our provision release we rated the moodys baseline and were recessionary as three scenarios equally this quarter a slightly more conservative weighting than the prior quarter south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2022 slide outlines the total loss absorption capacity at the end of the quarter including the acbi preliminary loan marks our ending allowance to loans was or including the reserve for unfunded commitments with another basis points in the unrecognized discount on acquired loans on the capital front we repurchased approximately million shares in the first quarter and an additional  in april bringing the yeartodate purchases to just over million shares and leaving us approximately  remaining in our repurchase authorization as noted on slide this quarter significant movein rates has caused an aoci swing which led to an decline in our tbv per share to and brought our tce ratio to ill also refer you to the high calling nature of our investment portfolio as noted on slide our ending regulatory capital levels remain strong with cet1 of and total risk based capital of ill now turn it back to you john john c corbett chief executive officer director south state corp all right thank you will this is the kind of environment when south state will thrive between the population shift to the southeast a liquid balance sheet steady loan growth and rising rates weve done a very nice ramp ahead of us operator please go ahead and open the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question today comes from stephen scouten of piper sandler your line is open stephen stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah good morning everyone thanks for the time im curious john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp good morning stephen stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co first maybe if we could talk a little bit about the further about the asset sensitivity obviously thats a bigger story even though stocks arent getting credit for it yet today but you guys look extremely well positioned there and you noted the basis point deposit made the last time around but im wondering what the underlying assumptions are within the i guess its up in your ramp scenario if you could remind us on that because i would think given all the liquidity or whatnot youd actually be much more asset sensitive than peers than maybe that modeling would show me so just maybe some of the conservatism that ive seen in your assumptions south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2022 stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp sure stephen this is steve well let me kind of give you the bottom line upfront and then tell you why we think this so our net interest margin was in the first quarter based on moodys consensus forecast to be to fed funds rate at the end of the fourth quarter and with about billion interest earning asset base which we expect to be reasonably flat we would expect them to be at the end of the fourth quarter somewhere between and and that improvement if its if the moodys consensus is right would be somewhere between basis points and basis points per quarter starting in the second quarter so as you mentioned we are asset sensitive its roughly basis points for every basis point hike the reasons for that we have a couple of slides on the deck just to kind of unpack it page speaks to our loan portfolio and we have about of our loan portfolio is floating daily variable and then fixed if you combine that loan floating rate loan portfolio with our excess cash of we have about onethird of our interest earning assets about billion interest earning assets that float daily so that makes us thats all part of that assumption we have a slide in there and i think we referenced a few different earnings calls but its page and it really speaks to the deposit beta and what this did is it went back to our previous interest rate hiking cycle in and graph the combined company to see what the betas were and thats where you can see that we ended up at the fed funds rate at and deposit beta was on the first basis points and over the entire cycle so the last part is just the deposit portfolio john mentioned it earlier its a granular deposit base and thats why we think that betas hopefully will outperform in this cycle page speaks to the deposit mix of our deposits are in checking accounts versus our peers of and then you can see weve added a new graph in there that describes of our checking account balances are commercial small business and retail so and you can look at the average sizes of those balances its a very granular base of basis points so anyway i would just to summarize all of that is really two things we have about onethird of our balance sheet thats floating and we think the deposit base and the betas will be lower or will be similar to what they were in the last cycle william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp and ill just add in stephen as well the rate sensitivity on that slide is a static balance sheet and the numbers that steve gave for the nim improvement throughout the year also assume we continue at sort of our expected loan growth rate he mentioned a static earning asset base and that earning asset base should be remixed were assuming no deposit growth and that some of the cash is remixed into loans in then high single digit range throughout the period stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay great thats all extremely helpful so that and just the last tieup theres a deposit beta last cycle is that similar to what youre modeling in then in the current rate sensitivity assumptions william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp weve modeled that our betas are turned on immediately even though were not certain that it is going to be the case and yes were using historical deposit betas in our modeling south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2022 stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp stephen just to add one other thing were at this time whats different about this time is probably for the entire industry but were starting out at a loantodeposit ratio and so our ability were not saying were going to grow deposits from here well probably shrink some deposits i would imagine that were excess but clearly we always are growing deposits from just regular commercial clients so what were saying is that the same thing we said last time as were loantodeposit ratio right now heading toward a loantodeposit ratio by the end of and if you do that math and you look at our cash to assets today it basically moved down to to by the end of which sort of right sizes all of that the balance sheet management william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp and i guess just to stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp further comment on its based on moves like moodys consensus has it now which would be to hit in youre going to see further improvement from that to range as steve mentioned in  youll see improvement in margin from that point as well if that rate environment in fact occurs stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah thats phenomenal detail guys thank you and then just my only other question is around loan growth so how you guys are feeling about kind of this just north of run rate this quarter into the rest of the year and then the commentary around resi mortgage and portfolio and more of that production obviously with the addition of acbi i guess thats now down to a smaller percentage of the balance sheet so could we see that resi real estate move back towards given the strength of that dynamic between portfolio and secondary john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah ill start stephen this is john and then steve can talk about residential but i mean ultimately were a growth company and great growth markets kind of our mantra is to grow everything good in the bank at an annualized rate of about through a cycle our guidance on loan growth the last couple of quarters has been high singledigits up to as prepayment speeds slow down with the rise in rates we think that our current production levels will produce that level of growth were looking at april right now and were exceeding that level of growth were in the doubledigit range for april so well see how it plays out but we still feel the guidance we gave previously is good guidance high singledigits by and steve how about the residential portfolio south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2022 stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp and we have a slide in there on page and it speaks to sort of the production in quartertoquarter and yearto year and yeah only comment i would make on that stephen is you know if you look this quarter we were portfolio which and then secondary if you look at that a year ago we were secondary the main difference is the gain on sale margins the gain on sale margins a year ago on that graph are so yeah we sold more in the secondary today theyre down to which is more in line so the way i kind of think about that gain on sale margins a year ago were high rates were low and so we didnt want a portfolio now rates are higher but gain on sales portfolio margins are lower so i would think that over the course of the next several quarters id say probably towards the end of the year well get to maybe more of a mix just because we like some of this portfolio arms and other things in a higher rate environment stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co perfect very helpful congrats on a great quarter guys i look forward to when the market rewards rewards everyone for it appreciate it john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp likewise thanks stephen operator thank you our next question today comes from michael rose of raymond james please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah hi michael michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc just wanted to dig hey just wanted to dig into the correspondent business a little bit and kind of what youre seeing there i appreciate the color that you provide on the slides im trying to pull up which one it is exactly but yeah if you can just kind of walk us through kind of what happened this quarter and then with rates moving what the expectation would be for the business as we move forward thanks stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp sure michael page in our deck speaks to the correspondent division and youll see that over the past four quarters or so the revenue has sort of ranged between million and million i think our guidance that weve given you all is somewhere between million and million and that continues to be our guidance it doesnt change south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2022 what were seeing you can see on this graph that certain times our interest rates our arc revenues are higher than fixed income and sometimes fixed income is higher than arc revenues and it has to do with the shape of the curve but at the end of the day the way i kind of look at it from a big picture perspective is the banking system today has a lot of excess liquidity and our correspondent banks of them almost of them are going to either loan that money or invest that money and so we continue to see that guidance to be very similar to what weve had i would anticipate this next quarter because of the change in rates and because the 5year and the 10year are a little bit closer to flat i would expect arc revenues to be a little higher than fixed income but at the end of the day i dont know that theres anything major has changed in our guidance michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc thats very helpful color steve and then maybe just going back to the margin which i think the commentary was very bullish i think you said kind of exiting the year in the to range just to put a finer point on it are you assuming the forward curve meaning seven or eight more rate hikes from here in that outlook stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yes were assuming that back to the moodys consensus forecast which we use to do our modeling is that we will have a to fed funds rate at the end of the fourth quarter and then as will mentioned that that moves into whereby we would get to a thats what the moodys forecast says today and if thats true we would get another to basis points improvement from the fourth quarter in the full year michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc got it okay very very clear okay thanks for taking my questions stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah thanks mike operator the next question in the queue comes from kevin fitzsimmons of da davidson your line is open kevin kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson companies hey good morning everyone john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp good morning kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson companies just wanted to talk about credit obviously it was there were a lot of moving parts this quarter with the day provision but then the big release as well which i cant argue with given the outlook but then on top of that like south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2022 john you mentioned at the beginning of the call that theres this kind of lingering concern out there in the market not necessarily on the street about recession but theres a lot of there is some uncertainty so how do you with that acl ratio down to about now and the size of the releases taken this past quarter how do you feel about provisioning and where that acl migrates to going forward does it still have room to run down or should we be just applying a reserve for loan growth going forward william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah kevin i share your frustration with the inability to predict that and its obviously a function of the cecl model and the impact of changes and the economic forecasts on that so maybe sort of unpack that just a little bit so as i said in my comments for this quarter we used a weighting of two scenarios the baseline scenario which is moodys sort of middle of the road forecast where they assume theres a chance of things being better or worse than that and then we also weighted their s3 scenario which is their recessionary scenario and that on the probability curve is in their lingo is a chance that things are better than that than the s3 and a chance things are worse and so at a weighting of those two essentially youre at on that if you pictured a straight line horizontal line between being the happy days are here again and being a terrible economic event were at by going to of and of the and we have used weightings between and twothirds based on onethird over the last number of quarters so weve been in that effectively weighted average range of to just to keep that mental image of the horizontal line as the example if we had gone baseline so just to stick with ph whatever least things can happen and not wait in another scenario with more pessimism it would have told us to have a reserve of about basis points below where we are where we were at the end of the quarter and if we go with s3 it would had us about basis points higher now the thing that ill caution you is that that changes quarterbyquarter as those forecasts in the underlying economic metrics and that are lost drivers in the cecl model change so it could be that in a worse time s3 is a lot worse and baseline is a lot worse so those are not static amount so anyway thats sort of the underlying thing we it could go lower if their forecasts continue to improve and they could also get worse and as we all know with cecl if the projections are moved to predict worsening economic outlook quickly then youll see a quick reaction through the provisions for credit loss to build that back up just based on the variability that cecl imposes william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah and kevin look thats all the modeling and accounting stuff and thats a lot of detail there the reality is as were going out in the marketplace meeting with our customers and were doing portfolio reviews of different asset classes we just we dont see nearterm issues at all were looking at our line utilization rates theyre still very low theyre to below what they were in telling us that our clients arent having to lean heavily on their lines they have got a lot of cash we looked at our loantovalues of our commercial real estate portfolio it is very conservative i go back and i look at our five year chargeoff rate it averages about basis points so i do not share the markets concern about a nearterm recession the way the market reacted when the yield curve inverted theres a lot of macro monetary forces going on right now with that yield curve that are maybe not south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2022 normal market forces so were pretty bullish in the near term for the next year or so our clients are bullish and we like the underwriting standards that weve got right now and so we dont see nearterm issues kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson companies thats very helpful thank you one question you earlier talked about expenses and with the obvious focus of trying to help us blend together acbi and legacy south state but can you talk a little bit about the environment for hiring i know just recently you guys put a release out about some hires made in some different markets in your footprint theres also some large end market mergers going on so its not you guys doing an moe anymore with someone else but just im curious with that potential for producers to be onboarded how youre what kind of opportunity that might represent for you and is that included within that guidance for expenses thanks robert r hill jr a executive chairman south state corp yeah the opportunity is huge greg lapointe is our chief banking officer but really hes our chief recruiting officer hes out on the street all the time meeting with bankers at other banks were not responding to bankers that are looking to leave were reaching out and telling our story talking about the south state culture and our ability to recruit from the biggest banks is better than its really ever been and theyre in these key markets and theyre bankers that have been at the same place sometimes their whole career with huge books of business and that weve just got a great fifth year when i come on board out of at first at wells fargo where weve got the balance sheet scale the treasury management products the capital markets products that they can easily bring their clients over and theyre having tremendous success so were real bullish on the opportunities to recruit and im just real proud of our team and what theyre delivering so from an expense standpoint well if were not going to let the budget restrict us from hiring if theres opportunities william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah and we have assumed we will be we will continue to have the success that weve had in that arena as we think about our costs going forward kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson companies okay great one last one from me just given the bullishness and the fact that this all this asset sensitivity the markets doesnt seem to be you dont necessarily seem to be getting rewarded you did buy back shares in the quarter should we expect that kind of pace or is there a certain price range where youre going to be more aggressive in terms of stepping in william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp kevin weve always said that our first priority and first desire in investing capital is to invest in growth and anytime we can deploy capital into growth we prefer to do that we believe weve got a pretty good opportunity ahead of us to continue to grow loans nicely and accelerate that growth a bit south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2022 so its likely that youll see us pivot to investing capital in growth if that growth materializes weve been very active in capital returns over the last year weve used up about million of that million share authorization from january of and as i said about  remain so it depends upon on the opportunity set but our preference is to invest it in growth kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson companies got it all right thank you guys william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp all right operator operator instructions our next question in the queue comes from jennifer demba of truist securities your line is open brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey this is brandon king on for jenny good morning robert r hill jr a executive chairman south state corp hey brandon william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp good morning brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey so deposit growth on an organic basis was strong in the quarter and i was just wondering what youre seeing later this year as far as deposit growth and where we could potentially see the loan to deposit ratio by the end of the year stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp sure brandon this is steve we did see really good deposit growth in the first quarter some of that is seasonal and typically what happens is the second and third quarter are a little down and then that comes back in the fourth and first quarter but as kind of how were thinking about the fourth quarter this year and really all the way through is to hold our deposit balances flat and as we think about the interest rate discussion around betas we think that we probably could grow more in our markets but were trying to manage both margin and growth so i think what weve just articulated on the call was today were at loan to deposit ratio and if we dont grow deposits for the next call it month through the end of by the end of with our forecast for loans being in the high singledigit we would see our loan to deposit ratio being about and with the way we would really do that is we would take the excess cash that we have today which is about we have a billion in south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2022 cash call it about billion of that is sort of excess billion to billion and thatll go to loan growth over the next months william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp and as you can appreciate brandon one of the hard things to predict with deposit growth is how the fed reacts with their own balance sheet so we think it appropriate to conservatively assume we dont grow deposits at this point brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thats helpful and then in regards to atlantic capital i know they had a pretty substantial growing fintech payments business and i wonder if theres been any sort of update there as far as how that could be expanded further any opportunities youre seeing in the market there john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah this is john kurt shreiner runs that business for us and over the last few years theyve been growing deposit balances and fee income at a compounded growth rate about so in some respects that growth in the payments business the fintech business was sort of outstripping the atlantic capital balance sheet size so now as weve joined together they can continue growing that business as they had in the past so we just looked for that continued growth rate if they can keep doing that instead of a larger balance sheet theyre not going to be constrained as they might have been before so kurt does a great job and we are excited to add those verticals brandon king q analyst truist securities inc all right thanks thats all the questions i had william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp thank you operator our next question today comes from samuel varga of stephens inc please go ahead samuel varga q analyst stephens inc good morning this is samuel varga on for brody preston how are you john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp well thank you south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2022 samuel varga q analyst stephens inc i apologize if you already made some comments on this but i wanted to circle back on the loan production and i just wanted to ask if the quarteroverquarter decline and granted some of that is seasonality for sure if that was in any way due to the acbi being folded in or is that purely market dynamics john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah thats not a result of the folded atlantic capital kind of rolled in on march so if you exclude the acquired balances that loan growth was just a lot of growth coming out of florida and atlanta and were getting some good growth at alabama as well but its kind of a nice mix of ci cre consumers growing again it was not last year but consumers growing again and then residential so its kind of across the board but that growth rate excluded the acquired balances of atlantic capital stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp i guess as i think about residential we talked about it earlier but as we put more production on the balance sheet and less in fee income were going to see less fee income moving forward i think before we had guided our secondary fee income to be or our noninterest income to assets to be between and basis points we think now with a little bit more of that mortgage production and some of the indiscernible fees going away so thatll be between basis points and basis points from here on samuel varga q analyst stephens inc understood thats very helpful and then i actually did want to circle back on mortgage a little bit and ask how i guess refi volumes are trending and specifically if you could just give some color on since quarter end after april how has that looked william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah so we have a slide there on page and you can see the production this quarter its billion of which was purchased was refinanced so that refinance volume is going to trend down as the 30year mortgage rates are in the so we would expect the purchase volume to continue to remain strong were seeing a lot of activity continued activity particularly in the constructiontoperm loans for our individual borrowers we have a private wealth group theres a fair amount of construction loans that we do directly to high net worth individuals that have relationships with us so i would say that the refinance volume is going to fall off theres no doubt about it but we do think the purchase volume at least for the short run is good stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp and weve never been a refinanced focused shop obviously weve gotten our share when refinance market is big but our focus is on purchase activity historically south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2022 samuel varga q analyst stephens inc understood thank you for that color and then just one last one on mortgage gain on sale margins are pretty nicely stabilized for your teams at this level and so could you give some commentary on the outlook from here moving forward stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah i think gain on sale margins are coming in and particularly as you have this big movement in rates youre going to have so i would just expect mortgage back to part of that guidance the noninterest income to come down basis points somewhere between and basis points in total id envision that mortgage probably is going to come down some more in the secondary side as gain on sale margins are tightening then we put more production on the portfolio william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp and just to step back to or feet mortgage will not be a big part of the story in this kind of environment but our expectation with this yield curve is that the other cylinders in the engine ie the net interest margin more than make up for that and were excited to have a yield curve back in our business samuel varga q analyst stephens inc thank you if i can just sneak one more in quick on the fixed income revenue side of things i guess should we expect some revenue pick up somewhat in tandem with how community banks are increasing bond purchases or are those two not linked at all stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah i think our guidance has been million to million a quarter and if you look at that graph for the last several quarters its been somewhere between million and million we dont think that any of that changes the nature of it might change between our arc and our fixed income and our correspondent division but in reality the banks had an aoci hit like everybody did and theyre a little bit shell shocked right now but theyll come back in when this thing settles down and to your point over time fixed income will get better if we have a steep yield curve but in the short run we think our arc revenues will be a little bit better than fixed income but the total pie will be similar to what weve had samuel varga q analyst stephens inc great thank you for taking my questions appreciate it
