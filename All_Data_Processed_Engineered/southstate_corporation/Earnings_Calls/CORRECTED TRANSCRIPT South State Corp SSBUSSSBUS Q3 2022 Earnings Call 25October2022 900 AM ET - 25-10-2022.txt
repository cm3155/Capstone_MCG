our shareholders for your patience the last two years as we have moved through significant changes at southstate the timing to make major changes has turned out to be very good as we have enhanced our size our scale and great businesses our efficiency and rebuilt our technology platform as the economy now approaches a more uncertain and turbulent time ahead these are the times when southstate will really stand out the rebuilding of the company along with our core funding conservative credit culture and great markets have us wellpositioned for the road ahead thank you for your time today ill now turn the call over to john john c corbett chief executive officer director south state corp thanks robert good morning everybody ill make some brief comments about the operating environment and our third quarter results afterwards will can share more detail about the financials and then well take your questions before we talk about the bank its important to take a step back and reflect on the macro environment over the last two years the united states government flooded the banking system with excess deposits and basically provided a pandemic bailout with the ppp program and support for consumers in that pandemic environment every bank in the country was depositrich and had nearperfect asset quality metrics now suddenly the tables are turned as the fed dramatically raises rates and embarks on qt good oldfashioned relationship deposits liquidity and credit discipline will drive the distinctions in bank performance over the next two years this is an environment where southstate should shine let me mention a few of our third quarter highlights were pleased to have two sequential quarters of very strong revenue growth operating leverage and loan growth our earnings ramp has been steep and the momentum is obvious our ppnr per share is up from the same period last year in the third quarter our nim expanded significantly operating leverage improved and that drove our efficiency ratio down to we watched our nim expand basis points in the third quarter after expanding basis points in the second quarter thats pretty dramatic basis points of nim expansion in just two quarters and to be clear that margin expansion is not the result of actions we took in the last two quarters but actions we took in to retain more cash on our balance sheet than many others we took the long view and held on to plenty of dry powder to put to work in this higher rate environment as expected the significant nim expansion was partially offset by weakness in our capital markets and mortgage business mortgage production remained strong with our focused on purchased mortgages in our growing southeast markets but with low gain on sale margins we decided to hold of the production on balance sheet and only sold total loans grew on an annualized basis and were evenly split between the commercial and retail bank despite the recession fears our asset quality metrics remained very clean and we had net recoveries in the quarter hurricane ian hit southwest florida last month as a fierce category storm now thats an area of the state where we dont have branches after the hurricane devastated fort myers it moved slowly through our franchise south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 in central florida northern florida and on up to charleston as a category storm dumping over a foot of rain in some places so the primary impact to our customers and employees were power outages and flooding in central and northern florida we sustained very little structural damage and the power was restored within a week as we examined our exposure to the hurricane we determined that less than of our loans are located in the hardest hit areas of lee collier and charlotte counties and so far weve received very few requests for payment deferrals as i mentioned our granular deposits will be a differentiator for us in a rising rate environment with an abundance of cash on the balance sheet weve lagged the fed on the way up our deposit beta is so far this cycle and our total deposit cost is only basis points average deposit balances declined about annualized but that still left us with about billion in cash and billion in available for sale securities so thats about of the balance sheet thats liquid ill point out three areas that drove the endofperiod change to our deposits first we mentioned on our last earnings call the predictable fluctuation of deposits in the payroll business if the calendar quarter ends on a friday deposits temporarily drop about million in this quarter the third quarter did end on a friday so thats why its better to look at average deposit balances when comparing quarters and secondly as we previously announced we consolidated a number of branches in the third quarter which accounted for a portion of the reduction and third with the increase in rates we worked with some of our high net worth clients to purchase about million of treasuries through our wealth management division and were going to continue to work one on one with our valuable relationship clients while at the same time managing the appropriate amount of balance sheet liquidity as we look ahead we are cautious about the economy in and we share the concern of many that a recession may be around the corner its just hard to imagine a scenario where the federal reserve is moving this fast and something maybe something we dont see now but something doesnt break in the economy but even with this uncertainty we like the hand weve been dealt on a relative basis weve got excellent funding surplus capital and we operate in four of the six fastest growing states in the country regardless of the environment our team will show up to work each day and were going to continue to deliver exceptional client service and build franchise value one customer at a time with that ill turn it over to will to give you more detail on the financial results william e matthews senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp thanks john as you noted it was another encouraging quarter for southstate on several fronts we had record ppnr and ppnr per share driven by another ph solid margin increase we had a low deposit beta with a very moderate decline in balances we had good expense control and solid growth with some weakness in a couple of our noninterest income business lines not entirely unexpected in this rate environment and credit metrics had remained solid slide shows our net interest margin over the last five quarters net interest income of million was up million from  with core net interest income of million up million from the prior quarter tax equivalent nim was or on a core basis up basis points from  total cost of deposits of basis points was up basis points from the prior quarter while we hope to continue to outperform in this metric we do of course south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 expect our beta to rise over the cycle as deposit competition heats up noninterest income was down million from  primarily driven by a million decline in correspondent and a million decline in mortgage revenue in the mortgage business as shown on slide we had production of almost billion in the quarter but only of the volume was sold in the secondary market leading to a decline in secondary income ill note that our retail mortgage production yeartodate is down from last year versus an industry decline of approximately according to indiscernible for the correspondent division as noted on slide the sizeable and rapid move in rates continues to pose a challenge for demand for fixed income securities in spite of the attractive rates now available relative to the last couple of years interest rate swap demand was also down a bit in the quarter with such revenues comparable to last years third quarter noninterest expense of million was up million from  a bit better than anticipated with that revenue growth and relatively flat nie our efficiency ratio dropped to on the balance sheet loans were up annualized from  the highest percentage growth was in single family residential up annualized followed by ci up and investor cre up annualized line utilization across various loan types remained flat with prior quarters and still below prepandemic levels by or more john discussed some of the items impacting our decline in ending deposits on an average basis our deposits were down just under million or approximately annualized ill also note that our ending deposits are slightly ahead of where we had budgeted them for september with respect to credit we provisioned million for the quarter in spite of two basis points in net recoveries million of our chargeoffs were dda losses so net loan recoveries were closer to basis points or basis points in our cecl model we continue to use a more negative economic scenario weighting than baseline or consensus would indicate our asset quality metrics remain very good at this point as noted on slide but we remain cautious about the economy indiscernible allowance plus reserve for unfunded commitments moved up basis points in the quarter to with respect to capital on slide our riskbased ratios remain strong with cet1 of and total riskbased capital of and our leverage ratio improved approximately basis points with the quarters capital formation and slight reduction in the size of the balance sheet the move in interest rate and resultant move in aoci continues to negatively impact our tce ratio and our tbv per share with our tce ratio ending at and our tbv per share declining to excluding aoci our tce ratio would have been and our tbv per share would have been john ill turn it back to you john c corbett chief executive officer director south state corp yeah thanks will as always i want to thank our employees for their hard work and all they do to build value for our clients our communities and our shareholders operator please go ahead and open the line for questions south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question today comes from the line of michael rose from raymond james please go ahead your line is now open michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everyone a hey michael a hi michael michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning maybe we could just start on the nim and the kind of the rate sensitivity obviously its continued to kind of come down here a little bit and sorry if i missed this in the beginning but just given the loan growth and the low deposit betas can you just kind of talk about maybe some nearterm expectations for the nim and im sorry if i missed this but what outlook what rate outlook you guys are have assuming support curve or something else just as we move through the next couple of quarters thanks stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp hey michael its steve let me walk you through a couple of those assumptions and how were thinking about the next months or so really three major assumptions ill walk through and then sort of kind of give guidance at the end the assumption number one is just the size of the deposits and interestearning assets i think this past quarter it was a little over billion over the last several earnings call youll remember weve given you guidance that we want to try to keep deposits flat through the end of which would keep earning assets flat we continue to reiterate that same guidance and based on the loan growth forecast our deposit forecast our loantodeposit ratio would probably climb from somewhere around where it is today to the end of around so thats kind of how we think about from the size of the balance sheet management somewhere in the billion earning asset range the second assumption is just around interest rates last earnings call we did in july the moodys consensus forecast was for the fed funds to peak out at of course theres been a big change there the new moodys consensus forecast has the fed funds peaking in at so there was a large move in expectations in the third quarter south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 in our modeling so thats all that built in our modeling the deposit beta weve talked about this before the page speaks to both our previous cycle beta deposit beta as well as our current cycle beta and what it shows on the investor deck on page is that our deposit beta was last cycle cycle todate and so far this cycle at and our assumption continues to be that this cycle will play out the same way as last cycle so a beta so as we think about deposit costs when we think about our interest rate forecast we would expect our costtodeposits to get to around ph to sometime by the same time next year so if you think about that that increase in rates beta and then our original deposit costs that could should get you somewhere in there and as we think about the next four quarters really thinking about that ratably that change or so over the next four quarters is sort of a radical change so to kind of sum it all up based on the assumptions of the balance sheet size interest rate forecast and our deposit beta we would expect margin expansion from here and this past quarter at million we would think that the margin would range somewhere between million and million through the end of so hopefully that tells you the assumptions and sort of the big picture of how we got to those assumptions michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc perfect a lot of details as usual steve maybe just this one followup question ph probably sticking with you you guys have held the correspondent book revenue stream pretty consistent over the past couple of quarters but it did come off again this quarter it did come off this quarter can you just give some greater color there just on kind of how the business works and then maybe just as we move through this higher interest rate environment how the different pieces of the business you would expect to work over the next couple of quarters thanks stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp sure let me take a big picture approach and then drill down on the correspondent and maybe ill tie all that together fee income this quarter was million or about of average assets our prior guidance that we had last quarter was between and of average assets and we said that wed probably be at the lower end of the range until we got through some of this interest rate hiking till the end of at that point in time we gave the guidance for terminal fed funds rate was but because weve had this large move in interest rates really expectation up another one in the quarter some of these interest ratesensitive businesses like mortgage and correspondent have slowed down from a fee income generation perspective so think about correspondent our guidance was million to million a quarter were low in that guidance really the million to million a quarter until really we get through the fed stops raising rates so if you think about the puts and takes our interest rate swap revenue fell this quarter fixed income actually fell only about million but i would expect fixed income to be more challenging as the fed continues to raise rates and that shortterm rates and longterm rates all end up about the same so i think fixed income will be a little more challenging i think the interest rate swap business will get better but our new guidance for that is somewhere between million and million until the fed stops raising rates and we get into a bit more normalized environment so just to kind of sum up all of that yeah so with the next several quarters and until the fed stops raising rates we would expect our noninterest income to average assets to be between and as the fed stops raising rates when we get into a more normal environment sometime in wed expect the nii to average assets to get back to and and kind of act as the hedge as we talk about the net interest income so south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 hopefully thats helpful guidance as you think through the puts and takes of correspondent and noninterest income michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc very much so thanks for taking my questions guys operator thank you the next question today comes from the line of kevin fitzsimons from da davidson please go ahead your line is now open kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co hey good morning everyone a hi kevin kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co just wondering if you can talk a little bit about loan growth how you how the pipelines look how you feel about growth going forward in terms of both what youre seeing in demand but maybe what youre also implementing in terms of maybe raising the bar on underwriting or stepping back on certain kind of loan segments any color on that front thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah sure kevin its john big picture i would say that the feds rate increases are working theyre slowing things down but it takes time theres a lag effect thats working through the psychology of our clients and our borrowers our pipelines are coming down from a ci borrower standpoint a lot of them are doing fine but theyre taking kind of a waitandsee approach theyre still borrowing money but its more to replace existing equipment versus expanding on the cre side were in a period here of price discovery cap rates are have been very slow to adjust to the yield curve but were starting to see that bidask spread on cre property starting to widen out i think theres a number of folks that were in the development business the merchant builders that are preparing to become ownermanagers and what thats going to do its going to slow paydowns down on the residential side i think the fundamental question is what kind of house can i buy with a a month payment in january when rates were you could borrow today you can borrow so i think that is going to cause a real slowdown in the residential side and were seeing that in some of the rate loss i think the fed is having and seen the desired effect of the rate increases so while loan originations are going to slow growth is going to be a little bit different there are some crosscurrents with growth in that number one payoffs that weve been talking about for two years i think payoffs are going to start slowing and theres a number of loans that we originated the last two years that are still in the fundup scenario south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 so i do think that growth is not going to slow down as fast as new loan origination slow so if we had to give some guidance wed say our fourth quarter estimate would be that wed be growing loans in the upper single digits if we enter into a mild recession in maybe midsingle digit growth but ultimately our goal by the end of is probably to put on another billion to billion of net loan growth and that gets us to that loan todeposit ratio that steve talked about if we hold the balance sheet and deposits flat but thats the macro picture were very very bullish on the markets on the southeast theyre going to outperform the rest of the country and the inmigration that will talked about you could see it in the residential numbers the nation mortgage origination this year yeartodate is down were only down about that speaks to the strength of the southeastern job front and inmigration but that a lot of its not just retirees its just great jobs and great economic activity in the southeast i dont know that many people are as aware of whats going on over the last several years and really in the last couple of years with the automobile industry in the southeast weve had just a ton of announcements i mean in georgia theres a new billion hyundai plant for electric vehicles new jobs the south koreans just built a new battery plant for electric vehicles north of atlanta jobs billion investment last week bmw announced an expansion to their plant in greenville south carolina billion and weve got a new assembly plant in huntsville alabama with new jobs for mazda and toyota so the southeast is going to be just fine and from an underwriting standpoint we try not to be a fauceton faucetoff lender we are abiding by our policies right now and were stressing the loans were making with this new interest rate environment so hopefully that gives you a flavor of what were seeing kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co yeah thats great john thanks just one quick followup i was wondering if i guess its understandable we wouldnt hear as much about it with the deal being closed for a while now but if you can speak to any observations on atlanta capital in terms of any remaining savings andor contributions that youre seeing from them whether better or less than expected thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah yeah this is john our pipeline and production in georgia have been fantastic so we completed the conversion in july conversion went extraordinarily well we are still continuing to work through the normal integration issues as the team members get accustomed to the new processes but they havent missed a beat from a loan production growth standpoint william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah and kevin ill take it on the savings side maybe ill go ahead and wrap this in the context of sort of the nie outlook and certainly can take further questions on nie as desired but we have pretty much essentially gotten most of the cost savings out through the third quarter theres still a few thatll trickle in in subsequent quarters including  and that also goes for the branch consolidations we did therell be a little bit more in  than  but id say our guidance for the  nie still would be where we thought it would be and thats somewhere in the low and if were lucky maybe down below this quarter we had a few items moving positively and negatively and we did a little better than we thought in nie one item of course is production in the correspondent business lower that drives down some of the commission compensation expense there and so depending upon the fluctuations in that business thatll impact nie as well south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 but also in  we expect theres probably continued incentive accruals that will drive that number up so still feel like  that number weve been guiding towards of low maybe high feels like a good number and then looking ahead to next year id say were still in the process of our budgeting cycle which is a very thorough bottoms up process where we review requests for capital in the form of fixed asset dollars as well as technology dollars as well as in terms of investment in people dollars and make decisions about those requests based on projected capital returns across the company so thats our normal cycle were in the middle of it now and well have better guidance well be able to give on nie when we get to our january call but ill just reiterate that we remain very focused on trying to manage our expenses in every environment including one thats got some inflationary pressures like this one and weve done a good job i think this year with our incentive plans of keeping that front of line with our teams and hope to do so next year as well kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co great thanks for all the color thank you guys william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp baylee do we have any other questions in the queue operator thank you the next question today comes from the line of stephen scouten from piper sandler please go ahead your line is now open stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co oh yeah sorry about that guys william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp stephen youre maybe on mute stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co a question around yeah sorry i was curious around your residential mortgage production kind of how youre thinking about that in this rate environment putting more of that on balance sheet and kind of around funding and rate paid on the ready mortgage indiscernible stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp sure stephen we talked about our residential portfolio on page and of the deck and just a couple of points to make there and then ill try to kind of frame all that up last quarter in the third quarter we produced about billion in production of that was portfolio was the secondary and of course was purchase so a lot of this is the refi business is pretty much done south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 on page we show a historical look at the portfolio residential growth and shrinkage over the past twoanda half years and characterized that around gainonsale spreads and mortgage rates the key takeaway when you look at that slide is weve sort of used residential as a balance sheet management tool when rates are low and gainonsale margins were high back in and we sold most of the production and took the fee income lately when rates have risen and gainonsale margins have declined weve run the portfolio balances over the last couple of quarters since if you kind of take a indiscernible look since the december of were at only million in total for over that twoandahalfyear period this quarter we produced about million of portfolio production of that was for our professional doctor program and we like that credit we think thats an appropriate place to put production to put on our balance sheet having said all that residential production will flow along with a lot of other production this year well probably do somewhere in the billion dollar range relative to production of which the entire period will be about of indiscernible portfolio if you look at next year our preliminary forecast and well continue to get sharpened up but its probably more like billion which is about what we did in before we had the pandemic and so were thinking thats probably more like portfolio secondary so just if you think about the balance sheet were going to probably produce more as we get into just because of the shock and rates and we have to kind of work through that period for the next to months or whatever before rates start stabilizing and production get back to where it might have been this year is that helpful stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co thats extremely helpful thanks steve and then maybe a quick followup on michaels earlier question around kind of the reduction in asset sensitivity is that primarily a reduction just as youve deployed more of the excess liquidity and you do expect betas to move higher from here whats the main driver around that kind of quarter overquarter change in the modeling stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah the main driver in that is our assumption around deposit beta if you look at it from the first quarter our nim was this quarter so were up basis points and our deposit beta is only at so if you just run the math and say based on history our deposit beta is going to be in the entire cycle versus where we are thats really whats driving that weve picked up a lot of asset sensitivity from here the question really is going to be difficult to answer for anybody is what is deposit beta going to do over the next months the best thing that we can model is our history and thats the reason that that asset sensitivity comes down and then well see how everybody performs over the next year or so william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah and i also remind you stephen that is a static balance sheet model so it has no changes in the mix or anything like that so its stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp its an indicator rather than a guide stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co great good reminder will thank you and then last question i guess for me is just things have been trending phenomenally well for you guys i think the last couple of years really obviously but for a longer period of time as well but the stock has outperformed significantly yeartodate how does that make you all think about the ma environment given the value of your currency especially coupled with the rate environment marks et cetera how should we think about the likelihood of you guys dipping your toe back into the ma game john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp it feels like the ma environment is going to be a little slow for the next few quarters stephen just with pe valuations where they are uncertainty around inflation and a recession so i think weve got a little more work to do internally to continue to refine our processes and our technology so ma in the short term is not a high priority stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it thanks john a lot of great color on the call today i appreciate it everyone operator thank you the next question today comes from the line of david bishop from hovde group so please go ahead your line is now open david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc yeah good morning yeah sticking with the indiscernible steve but i appreciate all the guidance there as it pertains to the balance sheet just curious exiting the quarter your view of excess cash im just curious maybe what you view as a floor for that does it get back to the prepandemic level of about billion just maybe your view of sort of excess cash and liquidity at this standpoint thanks stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp hey david its a good question this is steve yeah thats right around of assets give or take its probably sort of the floor for cash as you know we have very little in the way of wholesale have drawn any of that down so i think our brokered cds are about million or so that we did during the pandemic we did long term cds we have no federal home loan bank borrowing so we have quite a few levers relative to the flexibility within our balance sheet to raise cash but yeah i think thats a good way to think about the modeling and that if you kind of run that out thats probably an loantodeposit ratio at the end of and roughly around of assets in the cash if we do what we just spoke about south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc got it and one followup in terms of the loan loss provisions this quarter just curious how much of that was sort of deterioration and maybe the modeldriven inputs was that factoring higher unemployment rate outlook just curious maybe what sort of drove that elevated provision and what we should think about that moving into thank you william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah david thats exactly right in our and of course as you know with cecl you have lost drivers that are selected based on statistical correlation with prior loss events and in our case dates back to the year for every bank that makes up southstate with the exception of failed banks and as weve looked at moodys forecasts each quarter we do a pretty thorough analysis of not only the output they have in these various economic things but the underlying assumptions behind them and from that we make a judgment about whether we believe moodys is right on the money or maybe a little too optimistic or pessimistic for several quarters now we have viewed moodys as being more optimistic and moodys base indiscernible baseline and their baseline is pretty similar to consensus and so we have been waiting more pessimistically we did find moodys did move more pessimistically between  and  which did drive some of those loss drivers to be more indicative of higher losses we continue to be weighed down the recession there which is s3 and for a decent portion of our allowance so yeah the loss driver was indiscernible based on that you saw in the quarter we had net recoveries in the quarter and generally pretty consistent asset quality metrics so really the loss drivers from or the economic forecasts from moodys will drove our provision expense this quarter david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc great thank you operator thank you our next question today comes from the line of catherine mealor from kbw please go ahead your line is now open catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning a hey good morning a good morning south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc one followup on the margin we spent a lot of time talking about the deposit betas but just wanted to get your thoughts steve on loan yields you saw nice increase in your loan yields this quarter what are you thinking about for where new loans are coming on and then what ultimately loan betas maybe over the cycle as well stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp thanks catherine pretty much the same we have a slide in our deck that speaks to i think its page which speaks to the loan repricing frequency and what that basically says is about of our loan portfolio reprices on a kind of daily basis whenever they raise rates it goes up and then we also have another that reprices that are adjustable that will reprice in the next year so total of the portfolio will reprice in the next months so thats probably a good indication of sort of how we think about beta on the short end its roughly on that and then over time as you produce more and as those adjustments come in the adjustable rate book theres another that well reprice as it relates to loan yield obviously we had a big shock in interest rates in the third quarter and so our loan yield continued to move up and i think by the end of the quarter was over for new production of course some of that is floating and then as they raise rates itll be over just because its floating but anyway hopefully thats a good characterization of how were thinking about loan betas from here william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp and catherine ill just add that we catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats helpful william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp we benefit from a lag effect on the pricing side theres a little bit of lag effect on the loan side too as the market and lenders acclimate to the rising rates particularly ones moving as fast as these have and you have commitments out there that take a little bit to close so theres a lag effect on both sides catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great okay and do you have the rate at which loan where loan yields were maybe for the month of september stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah catherine i dont know exactly right in front of me but it was just north of i dont have the number but it was just north of for the month of september south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great okay thats helpful thats great and then wanted to just on the reserve i noticed that your reserve for unfunded commitment increased a little bit more this quarter do have any commentary on what drove that william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp catherine we did have some growth in our unfunded commitments in the quarter and just sort of how the math worked out when we think about the reserve in our allowance committee we do sort of think about it as a whole for the basis point number versus basis point number and itll fluctuate quartertoquarter the fluctuation in the portion that goes in the reserve for unfunded ie the liability versus the allowance for credit losses the contract asset it does swing quarter to quarter but i kind of think of it in terms of the combination of the two catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great okay thats helpful indiscernible anything to be aware of in terms of changing your accounting or provisioning for that william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp no catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i got it everything else was answered thank you very much great quarter guys william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp thank you catherine operator thank you operator instructions the next question today comes from the line of christopher marinac from janney montgomery scott so please go ahead your line is now open christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks very much will and john i know you gave a lot of details on the reserve and prior questions i noticed that the cecl reserve for the unfunded commitments went up a pretty good amount this quarter and that the unfunded commitments themselves grew a lot from june to september just want to get a little more background on that is that unusual or is more of that sort of line growth possible in the future william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2022 yeah i dont think its unusual chris and dovetailing in with the question catherine just asked that drove that was some of the reasons for the growth in the total reserve being more towards unfunded commitments but in terms of our i dont know indiscernible go ahead john john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah i mean other than just to say that the unfunded commitments really helocs and cis have been relatively flat we have not yet returned to the funding levels we had prepandemic were about to under the funding we had before the pandemic william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah helocs it gives our clients the flexibility going into if theres a recession william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah its interesting chris as we see with some of our other releases we are trying to see higher line utilization im sure we will at some point but thus far were still below prepandemic levels across pretty much across the board christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay im just looking at the billion thats up from the billion from june to september so if i somehow miss that thats fine and i guess my followup question just relates to kind of what youre seeing from your clients on the fixed income side as it pertains to kind of their use of wholesale funds do you expect them to be net borrowers and does that possibly spill over in additional business i know the guide that steve gave earlier which is very helpful just kind of want to get more context in terms of their behavior changes that might be happening stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah chris yeah very very interesting move to your point there was a lot of liquidity out of the system probably nine months ago and because of the loan growth and maybe the fed doing quantitative tightening that liquidity has definitely come down for our correspondent bank clients and we are seeing as opposed to more fixed income we are seeing some borrowers from the brokerage market and system sales from our indiscernible there but most of our clients and ill speak to the community bank clients typically have lower loantodeposit ratios and have really good funding bases and so most of them probably are much bigger users of fixed income because they have access to liquidity and lower loantodeposit ratios than they are of buying brokered cd buying or issuing brokered cds but clearly theres been an uptick on our debt which im sure is true for everybody just because certain clients are using it more than call it a year ago christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc south state corp ssb corrected transcript
