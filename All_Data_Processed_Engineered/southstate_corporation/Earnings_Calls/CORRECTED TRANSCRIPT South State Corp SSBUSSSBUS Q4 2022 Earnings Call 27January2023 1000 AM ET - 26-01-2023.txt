matthews cfo please go ahead william e matthews senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp good morning and welcome to southstates fourth quarter earnings call this is will matthews and im here with john corbett steve young and jeremy lucas john and i will make a few prepared remarks and then well open it up for questions as always a copy of the earnings release and the presentation slides are located on our website under the investor relations tab before we begin our remarks i want to remind you that comments we make may include forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and regulations any such forwardlooking statements we may make are subject to the safe harbor rules please review the forwardlooking disclaimer and safe harbor language in the press release and presentation for more information about our forwardlooking statements and risks and uncertainties which may affect us now ill turn the call over to john corbett our ceo john c corbett chief executive officer director south state corp thank you will good morning everybody thanks for joining our call were really proud of our team and the momentum thats been building throughout i think if is a year that we were taking the time to plant the south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2023 seeds for the future and was a year where those seeds began to take root and grow and that growth is reflected in the results that we announced last night during the fourth quarter ppnr per share increased over the third quarter that took us to a ppnr return on assets over and a return on tangible equity of we set aside million of reserves but incurred less than million in chargeoffs so credit quality metrics continue to be excellent and will can walk you through the impacts of the moodys economic forecast later in the call total loans grew annualized in the quarter and over the last few years weve recruited some of the best middle market bankers in the southeast and that team is doing a great job as ci loans specifically grew at annualized in the period deposits declined annualized and we still got balance sheet flexibility with an loantodeposit ratio our total cost of deposits landed at basis points and so far this cycle our cumulative total deposit beta is only if you step back and look at the fullyear for ppnr per share was up over loans grew deposits decreased and as we right size the balance sheet net interest margin expanded basis points over the entire year we set aside million in loan loss provisions but only incurred million in chargeoffs so we strengthened our reserves in to prepare for a likely economic slowdown in in addition to organic growth our integration team successfully completed the atlantic capital conversion last summer and our atlanta bankers are doing a terrific job in a dynamic market the census bureau released their latest population report last month we updated a census bureau map on page of the deck that breaks out the four regions of the country and since the pandemic began in million people in the western states the northeast and the midwest sold their homes they packed their bags and they moved to the south and of the million people that moved to the south twothirds of them landed in our southstate markets based on the latest census report southstate continues to do business in four of the six fastest growing states in the country with florida ranking number one as the fastest growing state in the country last year as we think about the economy and the year ahead it seems to us that the fed is getting what it wanted the economy is slowing and loan pipelines are shrinking so we dont know if will be a soft landing a mild or moderate recession but what we believe is that regardless of the direction of the economy based on the level of population migration the south will outperform other areas of the country we believe in the power of compounding over time so our aspiration has always been to grow everything good at the bank at a compounded annual growth rate of a year over a cycle three years ago this week we announced the merger of equals of centerstate and southstate and began the integration process coincidentally right when the pandemic hit its obviously been a volatile three years of monetary policy since the merger announcement and our growth has been lumpy but if you look back over the last three years and if you smooth out the lumpiness of the cycle weve grown at the pace that we planned deposits have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of since the merger announcement and loans have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of a year since the merger announcement so our team is executing on our plan and were now witnessing the earnings power of their hard work so ill close by congratulating and thanking all of our team members from our it team that made big improvements to our digital offerings to our risk management areas that have strengthened our defenses to our bankers that generated billion of new loans during the year and our branch employees that have cared for our clients through countless changes youve done a great job in a challenging environment south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2023 so will ill turn it over to you william e matthews senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp thank you john and ill echo your comments the team has really done a great job executing in this environment leading to great results for the quarter and the year we had another very strong quarter and net interest revenue with a tax equivalent nim of up basis points from the third quarter and core net interest income up million our loan yields improved by basis points and our cost of total deposits rose by basis points versus the third quarter as we noted last quarter we expect our deposit beta to increase from this point forward noninterest income totaled million down million from  a few items ill mention impacting noninterest income we wrote down the value of our msr asset by million which led to negative mortgage division revenue for the quarter we also wrote down our sba servicing rights asset by for a combined million writedown on servicing assets in the quarter youll also note that we began applying settletomarket accounting for variation margin collateral on exchange cleared swaps to net against the swap asset or liability that resulted in a decrease in deposits and swap assets on the balance sheet and a decrease in the corresponding interest expense and noninterest income with no effect on net income and to help with your models weve adjusted prior periods accordingly as noted on page of the release mortgage production fell in the quarter to approximately million with of the volume being portfolio looking forward expectations for mortgage production in remain muted across the industry we expect ours to also be down significantly from but we expect our percentage of secondary market production to increase correspondent income continue to be somewhat challenged in this rate environment service charge income showed a seasonal lift and our wealth management division closed out another strong year noninterest expenses of million were up slightly from  with no big swings versus the prior quarter looking to we currently estimate nie in the million range with the first quarter being in the low million that would represent an increase of approximately from if normalized for months of atlantic capital i will note that there are of course factors in our business lines and in loan production that can cause the nie number to increase or decrease through the year due to the impact on commissions incentives and deferred loan costs on the balance sheet the billion in loan growth john mentioned was centered in singlefamily residential cre and cre construction and ci loans although were starting to see some slight increased usage on commercial lines line of credit utilization remains about below prepandemic levels expectations for loan growth in are in the midsingle digit percent range as were seeing pipelines and preflight discussions decline and a general sense of cautiousness amongst borrowers deposits declined approximately million in the quarter so coupled with loan growth our cash and fed fund sold position declined billion to end the quarter at billion we continue to have very little wholesale funding with only million brokerage cds and no fhlb advances at yearend our riskbased regulatory capital ratios were essentially flat compared to  and our tce ratio improved approximately basis points to ending tbv per share rose back above to end the year south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2023 turning to credit as john noted we continue to have excellent credit results though we recorded a higher provision expense due to economic forecast changes we had minimal net chargeoffs for the quarter and the year and basis points respectively and in fact excluding dda overdraft chargeoffs we had net loan recoveries for both the quarter and the year npls were up million ending at basis points of loans caused by a million increase in acquired sba npls which are generally government guaranteed so net unguaranteed npls were almost flat as john mentioned criticized and classified assets were down significantly with a million decline in substandard loans and an million decline in special mention loans our million in provision expense was up million from  and was not due to a deterioration in credit but rather due primarily to changes in economic forecasts with growth a secondary factor million of this provision expense was for loan losses and million was for the reserve for unfunded commitments as noted on slide the ending reserve was basis points of loans with another million in the reserve for unfunded commitments the combined total as a percentage of loans is up approximately basis points from  finally ill note that weve included some additional credit information and loan categories of interest in slides and operator well now take questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now start todays qa session operator instructions our first question today comes from stephen scouten from piper sandler your line is now open stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co well thank you good morning everyone i guess maybe if i could start just with the question around resi mortgage and what you would expect to see that do on balance sheet and thats been a nice additive portion of growth but i think you just said will you might have more mortgage going to the secondary market next year whats the driver of that is that pricing or is that more that youre reaching more of a concentration limit on your balance sheet or how can we think about that the interplay there on mortgage stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp hey stephen its steve yeah its been a really nice year for residential mortgage and if you think about the volatility in that business particularly at the rates its changed a lot since the beginning of the year i think at the beginning of the year the 30year fixed rate mortgage was somewhere in the to it hit a high of about i think in the late third quarter we have a slide in the deck which talks i think its page in the deck and it describes sort of the balance sheet growth over the last three years in residential mortgage and what youll see in that graph if you look at it is when rates were very low in and early we shrank the residential portfolio and then and sold a lot of our production in the secondary market when rates or when gain on sale margins were high and then you can see as rates started rising we started putting more of that on our balance sheet so if you kind of looked at our threeyear cycle we grew about million but we shrank some and we grew some depending on the balance sheet management side so it was about cagr over the course of a threeyear period south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2023 as we sort of normalize that i would think that our residential mortgage will grow about the same as the rest of our loan book and i think weve guided to midsingle digits so just to kind of give you some perspective weve grown cagr over the course of a threeyear period but clearly residential rates have come down and the secondary market a little bit more attractive than it was few months ago stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay that makes a lot of sense thanks steve and then i think last quarter you said to kind of loan todeposit ratio by yearend obviously were already ph at that level so do you think that moves higher than that range at this point and then is the cycle deposit beta still the right number to think about or given how much outperformance youve had todate do you think its better than that stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah this is steve again i guess from a loan to deposit ratio lets talk about sort of our guidance and really it really hasnt changed a whole lot i think our starting point changed a little bit on the deposit side and thats why we had a little bit higher deposit rate indiscernible our goal is for is to grow loans midsingle digits and keep deposits roughly flat or maybe slightly up but somewhere in that area we have that page but let me take a bigger picture just for a second and i think youre trying to get to the question about margin so let me kind of just talk to that a little bit john mentioned it on the call but we had a great year on margin expansion and i think we have a page in the deck that talks about kind of the progression of net interest margin from the fourth quarter of last year to the quarter this year and nim is up basis points ive never seen that in my career from the last from last fourth quarter and its actually up basis points this quarter so as we talk about guidance for margin i want to give you the same guidance for that we have in october with just one update so as you think about the assumptions for margin theres really three things its the size of the interest earning assets its the assumption of interest rates and its the last question you asked which was the deposit beta assumption so in october when we had this call we gave a guidance toward about a billion average interest earning asset base in were starting out a little smaller than that but probably a little larger so theres really no change to that guidance on the last earnings call as it relates to interest rates on the last earnings call in october the moodys consensus forecast was for fed funds to peak out at in i think in the last forecast its moved up basis points to peak out at and then there to be a basis point decrease by the fourth quarter so if you kind of average it out its basically the same for the question you ask on page is our deposit beta and it shows our cycle the deposit cycle the deposit beta is at versus our historical at from last time and we just continue to model the same deposit beta as life cycle and then based on the interest rate forecast deposit beta we would expect deposit cost to get in that ph to at second part of the year which is about basis points from where we were this past quarter and as we think about that timing we would expect to of that to happen in the first quarter with the remainder of that over the of the rest of the year so with all that id just say during our last call we got into in we got into a to nim range for and our guidance or our assumptions really havent changed on any assumptions but we are increasing our nim guide to to for and that increase really is due to the basis point reclass of the interest cost on the swap collateral that is now in the noninterest income our noninterest or our net interest south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2023 income guide increases by basis point and it decreases by the same amount to noninterest income but total revenue is the same but really our guidance is essentially the same just with the little geography change so thats a longwinded answer but hopefully that gives you the pieces and parts as were thinking about stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yes extremely helpful color steve thank you and if i can just squeeze in one last one just maybe more high level here john you noted three years since you announced the larger moe here and you still have an advantage currency and as you said in really some of the best markets in the country but if you were to do incremental ma over the next lets call it two years what would be do you think your focus there is it still deepening further in your current markets would you look to expand into other strong southeast markets or how do you think about the franchise over the next couple of years john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp sure stephen i think this question was asked last quarter and really our thoughts on ma have not changed our view is that as we look into ma is going to be pretty slow for a couple of reasons i mean right now theres just not a lot of clarity as it relates to the regulatory approval process and theres not a lot of clarity as it relates to potential recession risk so i think the whole industry is going to be slow on ma in i believe its likely to pick up towards the end of the year as bank boards begin to meet and think about the future earnings stream if youve got an inverted yield curve its likely that earnings are going to flatten off in and people would be more enthused about ma than they are today i mean our thought process weve built the company in highgrowth markets and typically the type of target that makes the most sense for us is something thats about our size to ph of our size and our preference is our existing highgrowth markets its easier to get synergies and weve got markets that are four to six fastest growing states in the country so that would be our preference if we ever left the existing footprint that we have today we would look for similar kind of growth characteristics but if you look at the gdp of the six states were in it would represent the fourth largest gdp in the world so weve got a lot of opportunities to ph fish where we are at stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co great thats a really interesting statistic appreciate that thanks for all the color congrats on a great quarter john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp you bet stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co and great year operator our next question comes from catherine mealor from kbw your line is now open south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2023 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp good morning william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp good morning catherine catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc just to followup on the deposit beta conversation your betas have just been so incredible and i think the call for them to stay at about a level is obviously going to be industryleading and so is there a way to just i think a lot of it is because of your deposit composition right youve got so much in checking its very granular portfolio but were seeing betas really accelerate across the industry so is there a way to kind of explain why the beta wont accelerate as much as youre seeing from peers and within that kind of you talk about the balance or the deposit composition are you expecting much change in that composition or for your kind of balance of cds checking ddas to remain about the same and then maybe give us a sense as to the betas within each deposit category just to kind of show that maybe some of your higher cost categories really are having a beta like everybody else but its your mix thats driving this better performance thanks stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp sure catherine its steve and thats a mouthful of a question but i think i get your question so let me kind of ill go back the page is our sort of our deposit discussion and i think you laid out a couple of these things and then help me ill try to expand on that on page of our deposits are in checking accounts and typically those are the warehouse accounts for commercial small business and retail our peers are at so if i were to point to one thing i think that would probably be the reason that we think the overall deposit beta is at when you look at the different pieces its not just commercial its not just small business its not retail its really almost a third a third a third in each of those categories and you can see the various average checking balances having said all that i mean it is clearly a battle on the deposit front and the most sensitive things that are going to be to interest rates on deposit accounts are going to be money markets and cds and like everyone else were feeling the same thing and thats why i think as we look at the next year and if we look at the deposit betas and we assume that we end the year about basis points higher than where we are today a lot of that we think to of that gets front loaded into the first quarter and the reason for that is we certainly are feeling the pressure on the money market cd side and as of january we raised rates across the board so i think that area of the balance sheet is going to feel much more rate sensitive than our checking accounts and our job of course is to continue to grow core clients to protect the deposit franchise which is as you know the most important part of our balance sheet so as you see volatility and rates and how the yield curve has changed over the past months it was going to catchup it is catching up for sure but we still feel good today about our total cycle beta and assuming that the fed stops raising rates here in the next quarter so well see lag south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2023 itll definitely continue to increase some but we like sort of our position and that nim guide kind of has all that put together so hopefully thats helpful catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah ph its very very helpful william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp hey catherine this is will i would just elaborate a little bit obviously this cycle is a little different than once weve seen in the past and were giving you our best estimates based on what we see thus far but were certainly out there battling the same battle everyone else is we do feel like we entered with a really healthy core deposit base and mix and weve really allowed our market leaders who are closest to the customers and the ability to negotiate with clients on a oneoff basis and rather than us trying to make all the decisions from headquarters so thats our strategy thus far and hopefully well be successful and have a beta somewhat like last time but it is a different environment of course we acknowledge that catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc for sure okay so thats really helpful ph and maybe the other question is this is just on the reclass of the interest cost of the swap collateral that you disclosed this quarter indiscernible million today as and thats been increasing obviously as rates have been going up over the past couple of quarters so as we think about what were trying to model what that number is is it fairly steady at this million assuming ph the fed maybe up a little bit with just two more hikes and then if it plateaus this is about where that level should be or is there something more with rates changing that drives what that number is over the next few quarters william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah catherine theres really two pieces to it and its not easy to predict thats the short answer but the two factors number one were talking about the amount of collateral we post and the amount of the collateral is really dependent on the 10year treasury essentially and then the cost of that collateral indiscernible the fed funds rate so and if you think about it really were sort of at a neutral point indiscernible around so as rates come down less collateral posted to us indiscernible comes down as the fed funds rate moves up or down the interest thereon moves up or down so its kind of hard to predict i think steves numbers he was indiscernible million a quarter and that basis point comment he made a few minutes ago about margin moving the margin dollars from noninterest income but its a little bit of a swag at this point catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great okay i guess i guess my big picture was thinking that there wasnt indiscernible going away and thats part of the guidance for the nim i mean indiscernible stable going forward which helps indiscernible south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2023 john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah indiscernible catherine id just say that its about million at the end of the quarter give or take a little bit and for the close to fed funds rate thats about million a year and thats sort of catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp the assumption and thats the basis points on assets catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it that makes sense okay perfect ph and then maybe my last question is just on the fee outlook has anything changed the correspondence has been a little bit lighter than expected indiscernible so just any kind of thoughts on your indiscernible as we enter stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp hey catherine fee income was well over million basis points of assets our last guidance was between and basis points but as will mentioned earlier we had some oneoff events mortgage servicing ph sba servicing asset writedowns i think that was million or million and of course the indiscernible collateral was another million so ph its kind of through all that out there had been about basis points so it had been kind of in the middle of the range but as we kind of think about comparing the fourth quarter to future until the fed stops raising rates and some of our interest rate sensitive businesses like mortgage and correspondent we think its probably similar to basis points of assets and then thats not decline of basis points but if the fed starts raising rates we would expect that to start picking back up again and the noninterest income to average assets to increase back towards to basis points so were in a transition period where nim is obviously basis points up noninterest income has fallen my guess is its when the fed stops raising rates weve guided with you with the nim and probably the noninterest income ph business will start moving back up towards the back half of the year if our interest rate forecast is right south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2023 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great okay very helpful thank you great quarter stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp thank you catherine operator our next question comes from michael rose from raymond james please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning guys thanks for taking my questions appreciate all the color just on the expenses just a couple of questions can you just remind us what the expectation is for the fdic expense pickup is this quarter and if you can kind of remind us what assuming for annual merit increases indiscernible the first quarter just trying to get kind of a level set as we think about just kind of the first quarter within the context of roughly million indiscernible for the year thanks william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah michael i dont have the precise fdic insurance expense model in my head so i cant answer that part of the question weve modeled essentially a merit increase across the footprint and we do have some new hires were investing in a number of parts of our business across the footprint as a result of our strategic planning and strategic initiatives process that we just completed in the fall and so theres some new hires coming in as well and some of that and theyll be coming in throughout the course of the year as those initiatives begin but all thats baked into that million number that i referenced and expecting something in the ph low in the first quarter like i said in my prepared remarks and you know this but there are other factors that can cause that to move around a little bit i mean loan production moving up or down will impact deferred loan costs production versus incentive goals will affect incentive compensation things like that so those are all variables that are in there but thats our best estimate at this point michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc perfect and then just moving to credit obviously you guys felt the reserve this quarter it seems obviously changing a little bit of the modeling inputs but it seems pretty conservative especially with criticized classified moving actually down again qonq is there anything that just when you look out at the portfolio that kind of worries you theres been a lot of talk around office and commercial real estate maybe construction to some degree i think this is asked every quarter but just generally how are you guys feeling about credit and assuming the backdrop continues to soften or deteriorate would we expect to see that reserve ratio continue to kind of grind higher under those pretenses thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp michael its john i can maybe start on the asset ph quality here will has an opinion on cecl im going to let him tackle that but as you mentioned the asset quality is remarkably good right now i mean chargeoff is basis points really all ddas indiscernible net recoveries loan recoveries in the quarter and in last south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2023 year nonaccruals did pickup but its almost entirely as will said government guaranteed sba so the non guaranteed portion is basically flat weve added some slides too michael you might be interested in page and that kind of breaks out our underwriting loantovalue debt service coverages on commercial real estate and then also our consumer portfolio but as far as the areas that we kind of are focused on that we think could be challenging in the next year or two small business naturally is one i mentioned that pickup in sba loans but fortunately weve got the guarantees there but if you think about the pressure on small businesses with wage inflation rent inflation interest rate costs thats an area to watch its very small for us a couple hundred million dollars but the assisted living area with covid that continues to be something that were working through some weakness there and on office the metrics are all great right now for us and but there is this social demographic shift thats going on we look at our office book its about of the total loan portfolio right now were at a loan to value and a times debt service coverage that underwrites fine indiscernible advantage for us on office is that where weve done mostly smaller properties of them are under square feet and our average office loan is only million so of the portfolio in office for us doesnt mature until or after so hopefully the office shift will be a slow moving train and our clients and us will be able to react as the market shifts but those are the areas were watching so far we havent seen the deterioration or passthroughs are stable indiscernible mention classifieds are coming down william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah on the cecl point michael i guess a couple of things one our cecl model indiscernible data from every bank weve acquired excluding five or six ph failed banks dating back to and this is both of the companies making for moe and thats about or banks in total i think our loss drivers really vary by loan type but they include south atlantic region unemployment the housing price index the yearover year change the cre priced index yearoveryear change apartment rental vacancy rate and gdp for the south atlantic region so our future reserve levels or our future provisioning expense is going to depend upon changes in forecasts for those loss drivers as well as our actual net losses which of course brings down the reserve we continue to be more conservative in our outlook than moodys our reserve is about to higher than it would be under the straight moodys baseline scenario though moodys has gotten a little more conservative showing more economic weakening this quarter i dont think its appropriate for me to comment indiscernible accounting standard of fasb makes the rules and we live by them but if you look at our company over the last three years and you sum up the absolute value of our provision expense positive and negative and you get something north of million and over the same threeyear period weve had cumulative net chargeoffs of something around million im not suggesting that basis points a year is a sustainable net chargeoff level but i think in our view whats more important is not so much how much provision expense we have but rather how much money we lose in net chargeoffs because until we charge it off the provision expense really just moves from one form of a capital to another michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc no i certainly appreciate that and john i appreciate those slides you put indiscernible i forgot to mention those in the outset of the question so its good to hear just one final one from me point of clarification obviously the nim guide is moving up a little bit thats the allin nim correct and if so if you can just tell us what the expectation is for accretion or scheduled accretion this year thanks south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2023 stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah michael thats right its all in nim of between and for the year the decrease indiscernible i think in the fourth quarter was around million million i think we are modeling that around million for the full year of so i think it comes down a little bit but all that factored in the entire cut william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah and just to reiterate the moveup essentially was the geography change with respect to the collateral so as steve said earlier i just want make sure that point is clear that we got indiscernible up on the nim but by a similar amount down on the noninterest income so total revenue essentially where we were guiding last quarter michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc yes appreciate it thanks guys john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp thank you michael operator operator instructions our next question comes from david bishop from hovde group your line is now open david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc yeah good morning gentlemen john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp hi david david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc appreciate the guidance in terms of the expectations for loan growth obviously you guys had entered fourth quarter with plenty of excess liquidity indiscernible liquidity put down cash a bit how should we think about the funding of that loan growth indiscernible run off a little bit more cash do you get a little bit more aggressive on wholesale borrowings just curious how youre thinking about the funding of the growth this year stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah david this is steve the midsingle digits lets say its billion loan growth give or take a little bit is our expectation for we have about i dont know million to million coming off the investment portfolio so well use that cash and then with our ph guide with deposits somewhere between flat and up south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2023 million million is sort of the expectation for the year and then as it relates to the deposits as will mentioned on the call to the end of the year i think we had million or ph so a broker thats been out there for i dont know three or four years and no wholesale borrowings at the federal home loan bank yeah i think as we kind of go through this period i would expect i think let me go back in at the end of i think we had a little over billion billion and between borrower in fhlb it wouldnt surprise me if over the course of the next months we had something similar to that but bottom line is pretty close to indiscernible david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc i appreciate that and then just curious just a final question for me in terms of onboarding of new loans this quarter just curious what youre seeing new loan yields on new production this quarter versus last thanks stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yes david our new loan production i dont have it in front of me the fourth quarter i think in december it was approaching or so on the new loan production i think our overall portfolio yield ph at the spot at the end of the quarter was a little less than but close to so yeah essentially your portfolio is around i think we ended the indiscernible i think was the average i think indiscernible a little less than and were putting out loans close to give or take david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc great appreciate the color operator there are now further questions at this time so ill hand you back over to john corbett john c corbett chief executive officer director south state corp all right thank you and those are good questions and as always we appreciate your interest in joining us on a busy earnings call morning so appreciate that if you have any followup questions in your models dont hesitate to give us a ring hope you guys have a great day operator that concludes todays southstate corporation
