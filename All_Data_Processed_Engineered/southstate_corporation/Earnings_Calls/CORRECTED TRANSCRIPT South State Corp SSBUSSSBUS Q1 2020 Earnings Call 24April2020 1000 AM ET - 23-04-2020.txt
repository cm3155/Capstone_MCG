reserve the company still produced a return on tangible common equity of about capital levels remained strong with the tangible common equity at in response to the pandemic both will and steve have begun stressing our capital position on a pro forma basis with south state bank to confirm our ability to travel through this cycle without impacting our dividend or common equity together with south state we enter this downturn with a much stronger pretax preprovision earnings than a decade ago a conservatively underwritten credit book with significant borrower equity and surplus capital fee income continues to be a bright spot as the drop in interest rates provide a tailwind to both our capital markets business and mortgage business both of these businesses are operating at record levels of sales and profitability fee income now represents of assets which is above our goal the liquidity of the company is also strong with over a billion dollars in cash and fed funds driven by noncd deposit growth of during the quarter as for asset quality centerstate ended the quarter in good shape with an npa ratio of basis points and only basis points of net charge offs while bottom line earnings are always important other more urgent priorities took center stage in march and april as we quickly shifted our attention to the health and safety of our teammates and providing financial relief to our clients during the mandatory shutdown we kept our branches open during the shutdown but we moved quickly to limit them to drivethrough service only to reduce the exposure of the virus to our branch employees of the remaining nonbranch staff have been working from home ever since fortunately our teams have experience working from home during hurricane season when there are also mandatory closures despite the personal hardships on our team they were eager to provide financial relief to our clients in times of crisis or when our clients depend on us the most and we can really make a difference in their lives early in the shutdown our relationship managers and branch managers began an organized calling campaign to proactively offer assistance to those that are the most vulnerable we offered loan payment deferrals fee waivers for atm and cd withdrawals we increased our mobile deposit limits and began ramping up the process to distribute paycheck protection loans to struggling small business clients i like to suggest that its time to rethink the term bankers hours when i started in this business years ago i had a preconceived notion like many of a 9to5 work day and golf at the country club in the afternoon nobody predicted that bankers hours in would be hours a day days a week with bankers at their desks after midnight that is precisely what occurred in the two weeks after the ppp forgivable loan program was launched by the sba easter weekend was the crucible as our bankers at centerstate worked around the clock and processed loans to the sba for loan proceeds of billion in just two days saturday and easter sunday to put that in perspective that is three times the volume of loans that we generated a month and our team did it over a holiday weekend south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 since the program launched centerstate secured in total nearly loans for billion of cash flow relief for our small business clients the largest loan was million and the smallest was just borrowers included everything from doctors to plumbers to retail stores and to churches and schools in all centerstate secured continued paychecks for workers and id like to publicly express my pride and appreciation to our team for their patriotism during the national crisis they stepped up and they were there for our clients in a time of need finally im happy to announce that the merger between centerstate bank and south state bank is proceeding as planned we filed the s4 and that we have scheduled the shareholder vote for may 21we feel confident that the merger will close on schedule in the third quarter and theres also a small chance we could complete the merger ahead of schedule our joint south state and centerstate executive team began working together as one leadership team before the announcement in january and we continue to meet every wednesday to integrate the two companies even during this crisis periods like this of crisis and stress can be times when new teams are fragmented and people are driven apart or they can be opportunities when new teams are strengthened through the trials that they overcome together as our newly combined executive team with south state collaborated through the crisis the silver lining is that our personal relationships and our trust in one another have grown stronger we are eager to move forward to serve our clients and communities and to produce generous returns for our shareholders and to do it together as one highperforming company will over to you for more color on the first quarter financials william e matthews chief financial officer centerstate bank na winter haven thanks john our net interest margin was down basis points from  our core nim excluding all accretion was down basis points loan yields exaccretion were down basis points interestbearing deposit costs were down basis points and our teams made good progress again in march after the rate cuts with a record quarter for revenue in spite of one fewer day and million in lower accretion income versus  driven by our noninterest income businesses our correspondent business which is capital markets and fixed income had million in revenue mortgage had a great quarter as well with revenue of million turning to credit and cecl we had nonpcd net chargeoffs of million or basis points annualized with total net chargeoffs of million or basis points nonaccrual loans ended at million with the new accounting treatment of pcd loans bringing ending npas to assets to basis points absent the accounting change the nonperforming ratios were in line with the previous four quarters our initial cecl reserve was million or basis points plus an additional million for unfunded commitments additionally at quarterend and in light of the impact of the coronavirus on economic forecasts we made it  provision for credit losses of million plus an additional million expense to increase the reserve for unfunded commitments for a total expense of million in spite of us only recognizing million in net chargeoff during the quarter and essentially having very little loan growth south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 this brings our ending allowance for credit losses to million or this represents a increase over the day one cecl adoption allowance including the reserve for unfunded commitments which resides on the liability side of the balance sheet this would be basis points we also have on the balance sheet a remaining noncredit discount of million for purchase loans as is disclosed on page of the earnings release turning to noninterest expenses our efficiency ratio was adjusted relative to  our compensation expense was up million including million in higher health insurance as we have a self insured highdeductible plan so  expense estimates are often higher and million in higher fica expense in  versus  due to the annual resetting of the fica cap also included in our other nie line is the 1million expense to increase cecl reserve for unfunded commitments and our fdic assessment expense was up million versus  in terms of our tax rate we recognized the million benefit from the ability under the cares act to carry back nols to prior years with a higher tax rate we also had some equity comp payout in the first quarter and recognized million in excess tax benefits from that turning to capital formation we reported an rotce of in spite of the million provision for credit losses and unfunded commitments in the quarter and while we did grow the balance sheet to add some liquidity and had noncd deposit growth and dda growth our loan growth was only so loan growth did not consume capital in  while margins for the industry will feel pressure in this zero rate environment which will impact our profitability of course were pleased we were able to earn an almost rotce in a quarter with this kind of credit cost and that we earned over million in pretax preprovision income in the quarter this equates to a pre preroa of were also pleased that we ended the quarter with a tce ratio north of on the heels of cecl adoption and a higher  cecl provision expense though a strong capital position good core deposit growth strong pre preperformance and a healthy addition to our allowance during the quarter with a respectable rotce of almost after all of that ill now turn it over to robert robert r hill jr chief executive officer director south state corp good morning its a pleasure to be with you today and hope that you your coworkers and your families are well our first quarter was strong with record revenues solid loan and deposit growth and a strengthened balance sheet with added liquidity and increased provisioning for loan losses our preprovisioned earnings were record levels we felt that preparation for the economic environment ahead of us was very important we therefore bolstered our loan loss provision by approximately million john pollock will provide more color on our financial results in just a minute and i will start by sharing the way our bank is leading and managing through this period our bank is a reflection of the people businesses and communities we serve when they are going through tough times it is our job to be part of the solution this has been the foundation of our culture since the bank was started on the heels of the great depression and it continues to this day our bankers have served and sacrificed in the last few weeks to support our customers like never before beginning in late february our crisis response team was activated in response to covid19 this team has guided us successfully through a number of natural disasters and while this crisis is different the experience gained from past disasters is invaluable south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 i would like to talk about where our focus has been these past few weeks and what were doing to prepare for more challenging future throughout this period we remain committed to making decisions based upon a long term view and we see this as a time where relationships can be forged for decades to come our focus is in two main areas our team and our customers let me start with our team in addition to the ongoing efforts of running the company our team has been working around the clock to assist customers all the while were still working to merge our two great companies in the third quarter of this year im very proud of our team and enormously grateful for how theyve handled this crisis throughout the company the stories of sacrifice are incredibly inspiring the south state team has responded to the call as strong as weve been in the past weve never been stronger in the team than we are today with of our employees working from home and certain branch and support teams continue to work at their respective locations with almost all of our branches open and providing drivethrough service we have been fortunate to have just a few employees impacted by covid19 as it relates to our customers while were not on the healthcare frontlines we are among the economic first responders we are companies whose deposits and loan relationships are made up of hundreds of thousands of individuals and businesses this crisis knows no boundaries and is impacting small and mediumsized businesses and their employees across our footprint providing customer access to our bankers and our branches has been our top priority we have expanded our outreach both in person and digitally and have experienced a significant increase in our digital delivery channels early on we mobilize task forces in both our consumer and commercial areas to develop responses to customer needs we have found that in times of crisis communication is even more important job one was to proactively call our customers and understand how they are positioned to weather the storm much of the efforts today had been focused on providing principal and interest deferrals to consumer and commercial customers and facilitating loans for small businesses through the ppp program we took a proactive approach with 90day payment deferrals for areas most impacted weve processed principal and interest deferrals of approximately of our notes and of total principal balances these deferrals were not made because of the inability to pay but instead these deferrals allow us to have a more constructive dialog with our customers and to work together to manage through this environment and regarding the ppp program our team has worked around the clock for weeks to support existing customers and welcome new customers to our bank to date we have assisted almost small businesses through the program for a total of approximately million the average loan size is about we have a great opportunity to assist those in need and as other programs are developed we stand ready to deliver them to our customers south state enters this period in very good financial health our operating principles have always been soundness profitability and growth soundness speaks to capital strength core deposit funding liquidity and a granular and highquality loan portfolio while this crisis is certainly different than others we have faced in many ways we have been making decisions in preparation for this crisis for decades finally i want to thank both the centerstate and south state teams while we continue to operate and serve our customers separately during this time we are becoming stronger as one team this crisis were experiencing today makes the opportunity we have together even more compelling and confirms that this is the right partnership for our banks and for the opportunities ahead south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 i will now turn the call over to john pollok to discuss south state first quarter financial results in detail john c pollok chief financial officer director south state corp thank you robert as robert mentioned our teams have been very active risk managers ensuring that we are taking care of the needs of our great customer base and our shareholders our earnings this quarter were impacted by sizable provision of loan losses under the new implemented cecl standard due to a very different economic forecast than what we first imagined at the start of the year our provision for loan losses this quarter totaled million as compared to million last quarter with much of the attention returning to asset quality we have added some slides this quarter to help give you some insight into the various segments of our loan portfolio and jonathan kivett our chief credit officer will speak to many of these during the qa session we begin this economic downturn with what we believe is a very solid balance sheet with strong levels of liquidity and capital beginning with slide number our net income totaled million or per share excluding merger expenses adjusted net income totaled million or per share without the impact of a much higher provision for future loan losses our performance was very strong with growth in total revenues as net interest income and noninterest income improved million and million respectively on slide number you can see our net interest margin increased basis points linkedquarter at as the yield on earning assets was unchanged and our cost of funds declined basis points total interest earning assets advanced a little over million with average loan growth of over million as seen on slide number during midmarch with uncertainties surrounding covid19 increasing we added to our liquidity position with new borrowings totaling million we anticipate much of our loan demand during the second quarter will be under the sba paycheck protection program with a current pipeline of million turning to slide number you can see our accretion income totaled million up million as the result of the adoption of cecl and the change from pool accounting in the absence of pool accounting any discount remaining on acquired loans will be accreted in as these loans pay down renew or mature then on slide number you can see the million discount that remains on this billion acquired portfolio turning to slide number noninterest income increased by million this quarter with mortgage banking income million higher of this amount secondary market income was million higher and our mortgage servicingrelated income was higher by million the mortgage servicing rights income was unusually high as the hedge gains significantly outpaced the decline in the fair value of the asset this is the result of the 10year treasury yield declining much more significantly than the overall mortgage rates during the period lower mortgage rates of course significantly increased the application activity and our team has done a fantastic job processing this additional volume acquired loan recoveries no longer contribute to noninterest income in the postcecl world but totaled million this quarter and now flowed through the loan loss provision wealth management income was higher this quarter and our capital markets group had a strong quarter of backtoback swap activity during this declining rate environment south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 on slide number you can see the net changes in all noninterest expense categories excluding mergerrelated expenses adjusted noninterest expense increased million about million of which resulted in higher fica taxes in the new year the other expense category was also higher by million as it related to higher amortization expense of passive loss investments which has a positive impact on the income tax expense slide number shows our efficiency ratio increase slightly to from last quarter adjusted for merger expenses the efficiency ratio decreased to from primarily due to a million increase in total revenues tangible book value as shown on slide number declined linkedquarter primarily due to the adoption of cecl until the impacts of the covid19 on our economy are in the rearview mirror we do not anticipate any share purchase reactivity at this time i will now turn the call over to john corbett ceo of centerstate john c corbett president chief executive officer centerstate bank na winter haven as a reminder we are conducting this call remotely and i ask that you please direct your question to the appropriate individual you would like to respond this concludes our prepared remarks and i would like to ask the operator to open the call for questions question and answer section operator we will now open the line for questions operator instructions todays first question comes from stephen scouten with piper sandler please go ahead stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning everyone i guess my first question would be maybe for both teams but i guess maybe first for south state i noticed of the lodging portfolio on the deferral im wondering with that portfolio as well maybe all of the deferred loans in particular how much of that was you guys reaching out to customers versus inbound calls requesting deferrals and then why you think there havent been more deferrals as a percentage basis for the consumer kind of resi book as seen kind of various things and different companies this quarter that seemed like a pretty large percentage at like on the commercial side robert r hill jr a chief executive officer director south state corp stephen this is robert ill start and then weve got jonathan kivett our chief credit officer out ill turn it over to him but i think you can take multiple strategies on these on deferrals so when we use certain segments were going to get hit we were talking to customers instantly and these are like taking 0the hotel book for example these arent national hotel operators these are local operators who mostly raise local equity with local investors and have really good liquidity and little loan to banks so we know these people very well so we engage with them in what in a needsbased approach it was really we know that the next days are going to be tougher for the hotel industry plus deferral for days during that time lets engage lets get information lets make sure we understand liquidity position what you take the breakeven and how we come up for air in the next days south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 so that was the philosophy behind it so it was id say really all proactive on our part to help those customers kind of bridge the gap to get to the other side jonathan id turn it over to you for any additional color jonathan s kivett a chief credit officer south state corp no i think thats right robert the numbers of the commercial at or almost exclusively based on outbound calling just being proactive particularly in those industries the hotels retail and restaurant industries i think on the consumer book i think the reason those numbers are a little bit lower is that that is more reactive we just havent been as proactive in making those outbound calls stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay and maybe i dont know will if you might get to comment on kind of the similar ideology in terms of the deferrals and thoughts on consumer deferrals moving forward william e matthews a chief financial officer centerstate bank na winter haven thats probably better answered by john or dan john c corbett a president chief executive officer centerstate bank na winter haven yeah stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay good john c corbett a president chief executive officer centerstate bank na winter haven stephen this is john dan many of you dont know dan dan has been the chief credit officer here at centerstate for about a decade prior to that dan was the head of special assets for rbc for florida and then even before that he worked with richard and will back at the alabama national so dan has been with us in a combined team for a long long time dan do you want to address that daniel e bockhorst a executive vice president chief credit officer centerstate bank na winter haven yes very similar to what robert and john has indicated very proactive on the commercial side and more reactive on the consumer side and expect that the consumer side will continue to be somewhat stable and muted stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay so again you dont expect to see any increases on the consumer side resi mortgage i guess auto i mean do you think that could continue to escalate throughout the coming quarter south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 robert r hill jr a chief executive officer director south state corp weve seen a noticeable kind of leveling in drop off of the deferral request those that have been impacted has been impacted already we have very little exposure on consumer side for auto or any other smaller dollar consumertype loans stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay great very helpful and then maybe i dont know if this is will or john but curious if you give us any kind of visibility and i know this is hard input so where do you think the combined nim could basically shake out at this point i mean theres a lot of moving parts obviously heading to the next quarter with rates but just kind of get some kind of directional thoughts on where they combine them together how we can think about that john c corbett a president chief executive officer centerstate bank na winter haven yeah stephen this is john im going to let steve young answer that stephen dean young a chief operating officer executive vice president centerstate bank na winter haven sure hi stephen both i dont want to speak for south state here but from a centerstate perspective we were pretty pleased with how the nim is shaping out this quarter the core nim was only now basis points and i think that really reflects if we couldnt we cant help whats going on the asset side but there is a real discipline from those banks around our core funding as well as we can control we can control so theres been a lot of efforts to reduce rates on the deposit side so yes to give a projection from here is difficult as we know because of the environment although im certain but i guess from a if we look backwards i think were really pleased at centerstate on how the core margin i think we were and maybe john pollock he will talk to south states margin in the past but obviously in the future margin is going to be a little bit more challenging but i do think the balance sheets are a little bit bigger which will help offset some of that but john do you have any comments john c pollok a chief financial officer director south state corp sure i appreciate the question stephen id say a couple of things i think first as weve talked a lot about over the past six months as we knew going into the first quarter of this year the impact of cecl on our margin as weve talked about the discount now its coming through faster i think a slide that you ought to look at steven really is in both decks as you know on page of both of our decks we show you the discount so that discount that we each have million for us about million for centerstate that accretion is going to keep coming through and its going to come through probably faster so that clearly is having a positive impact on the margin now as we all know theres clearly going to be pressure with the way rates have come down but lets talk about the funding side a second so you can kind of see in terms of our cost of funds kind of for the quarter has gotten down to basis points well if you look at march now just kind of carveout march was down to so were seeing really on the funding side a lot of relief there were getting tons of funding in fact our deposits are up over billion since the end of the quarter and then obviously we got these ppp loans that will come through we south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 both got a big slug of that so trying to model that steven the fees are going to run through the margin of those loans probably get forgiven in the next few months and then youll kind of have a tail off of that so definitely a lot of moving pieces around that but got to have good core funding in this environment and we continue to see good opportunities i think as both teams mentioned we played some offense on the ppp side to get new customers stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay great and maybe just one last one from me curious john maybe if you could comment on expectations around service charge revenue obviously thats a pretty big chunk of noninterest revenue for you guys im just curious how you think that could play out with maybe fees being forgiven or less activity on cards and other things of that nature john c pollok a chief financial officer director south state corp this is john pollok i guess ill start with that id say lets just think about the ppp piece for a minute is were going to be after expenses north of million now that doesnt these contracts are written in pencil right so the rules continue to change so are we going to have to put up a loan loss reserve stephen im not sure but 20plus million in fees clearly pays a lot of bills that weve all been experiencing i know centerstate could comment on that number but clearly thats going to help in terms of trying to pay for all that stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co and yeah i guess i meant more like deposit account fees and just like directionally if that if we should see a big drop off there john c pollok a chief financial officer director south state corp well well be tougher i mean clearly the consumer is out less the bottom line is the unemployment rate is going to drive a lot of these things with the chargeoffs or with the fee income is the consumer is clearly getting a lot more cash right now theyve gotten a few stimulus checks but i think youre seeing with all people theyre kind of being little bit more stingy with their cash and kind of holding on to that but yeah it should have some impact i would think on these stephen stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay great thanks for the color again appreciate it operator our next question today comes from catherine mealor kbw please go ahead catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning robert r hill jr a chief executive officer director south state corp south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 good morning catherine john c corbett a president chief executive officer centerstate bank na winter haven good morning catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i wanted to see and maybe we can i guess ill direct it maybe to john first and then to will just to talk about the economic assumptions that went into your calculation for the provision and your reserve build this quarter and then how do you think about how maybe some of those economic assumptions have changed since quarter end just kind of help us get a sense as to how youre thinking about what kind of level of future reserve builds that we may see thanks john c pollok a chief financial officer director south state corp well this is john ill start catherine when we have developed our cecl model we used moodys analytics kind of for the economic forecast so obviously moodys has put out three different forecasts one on the march march and then the march and then we didnt really get the final until april so were kind of using the moodys baseline covid19 its got clearly a recession in the first part of the year unemployment going up to in the second quarter and it was kind of a peak to trough gdp about negative hopefully a partial bounce back in the third quarter and then i think the key number in that forecast is when does employment come back and in that forecast its so you kind of have that they kind of helps you accumulate the data id say catherine so you got that piece i think how were thinking about it clearly predicting the future is a complete guess in this environment nobody really knows today i think unemployment is clearly the key it was the key last time how unemployment goes its how past dues are going to go and how defaults are going to go weve obviously had an instant shock of supply and demand and then finally a lot of people like to use letters well we clearly dont think its a v i hope its not an l it feels like its more of a kind of a wider u or it might be a w and what i mean by w is stimulus comes in we kind of see an uptick and then we see a downtick as we kind of rationalize some of these businesses so thats how we kind of think about it i think in the second quarter clearly i guess im going to get three more forecasts from moodys this quarter so im sure thatll all be a little different but i think our view is we would continue to see some pressure in the second quarter but still a bit of time to play out so with that ill kind of toss it over to will william e matthews a chief financial officer centerstate bank na winter haven yeah thanks john yeah catherine our models are not exactly the same but they share a lot of the same components we also used the moodys baseline covid19 forecast and as john said that has been changing on a very rapid basis and then within that the factors that are probably most correlated with loan defaults and provision expense would be unemployment number one housing price index cre price index homeowner vacancy rate things like that and ill echo what john said what i think a lot of other banks have said which is that at march based on the information available everybody felt that their provision was appropriate and their allowance was appropriate if south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 we get the same type of changes daily weekly that weve gotten before its likely that we get around to june youll see the industry ourselves included continue to build reserves because it doesnt look like the economic forecast at this point are getting any brighter last comment ill make is just to remind ourselves as much as you that these are models and builtoff historical data in many cases different underwriting practices going into them today its a geography question because the capital move from tier to tier and our hope is that it doesnt flush out of tier into losses but time will tell and our ability to manage through the crisis will govern that as well catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats very helpful thank you and maybe a follow up is as youre thinking about the merger any updated thoughts on how youre kind of thinking about centerstates loan mark and kind of balancing reserve builds from this quarter and next quarter before the deal closes versus an updated mark upon closure thank you william e matthews a chief financial officer centerstate bank na winter haven yeah catherine ill start with that and john may jump in weve been talking together on this as we just alluded to the economy has changed a lot since we first modeled this deal when we announced it in latejanuary and we will model our book at close and so thats the proper way to do it and certainly as times are changing like this you need to wait until close but clearly and logically given the change in the economic forecasts the credit mark should increase from what we originally modeled additionally its likely that the percentage of pcd loans would also increase which would mean that the double counting impact of the nonpcd loans would decrease cdi is likely to be lower today than it was before rate mark is likely to be lower today than it would have been before so if thats all still true at close those are some of the directional impacts ill also remind you just looking back to our modeling though our combined cecl reserves the two companies at march were some million higher than what was in the original merger model so were not yet ready to say what the revised marks will be and we wont really be able to do that until were at close but those are directionally i think where you should be thinking about it john do you have any additions john c pollok a chief financial officer director south state corp i think i agree with your comments catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay very helpful thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from michael rose at raymond james please go ahead south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning guys how are you robert r hill jr a chief executive officer director south state corp good michael michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey just wanted to dig in for the restaurant book a little bit i know some of the markets in florida john are obviously diverse orlando a little bit more travel and tourism tampa a little bit more business oriented but i guess i was a little bit surprised to only see deferral at this point so can you give a little color on and im sorry if i missed it but on the concepts the split between fast casual and maybe fast food and et cetera just any sort of color there would be great thanks robert r hill jr a chief executive officer director south state corp sure the nice thing is were going into this without concentration there i think its a little bit less than but ill ask dan to address dan daniel e bockhorst a executive vice president chief credit officer centerstate bank na winter haven yeah maybe kind of some overview on the restaurant side our top two exposures are darden and1 three of the top are darden we have good strong guarantors if you look at the top credits requested deferrals four of those the guarantors have high seven figures or higher liquidity and so we are seeing a little bit of borrowers guarantors expecting a deferral when there is probably not shortterm need for that based on that guarantor support and we do skew indiscernible some of those type restaurant credits as well michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats very helpful and then maybe just on the retail cre book which is obviously a little bit bigger on deferral can you give some color there on whether its type of store location geography breakdown just a little bit more color you guys are comfortable on why you feel that that portfolio will hold up thanks daniel e bockhorst a executive vice president chief credit officer centerstate bank na winter haven yeah happy to do that i think our disciplined underwriting and approach to lending would pay off especially in this sector our guiding principles have always been cash equity guarantor liquidity dealing with borrowers who are successful in the last downturn relationship driven our typical center is a neighborhood center its going to be in dense markets with barriers to entry a good example would be a neighborhood center in indiscernible town weve got the indiscernible on one side the everglades on the other thats going to be dense and the demand for services will continue for the longterm a good example of some of the tenant exposure in these types of centers dollar south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 general pizza hut allstate insurance theyre all on the top these are national type tenants that are going to have longterm need to these local communities michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay maybe just one final one from me just maybe for steve on the correspondent banking business obviously some good numbers this quarter just in the very near term would you expect any sort of change in activity levels within the various components of the business thanks stephen dean young a chief operating officer executive vice president centerstate bank na winter haven thanks michael yeah just to back up for a second on the correspondent really just on the fee income businesses that john and will both talked about yeah big picture a few years ago we wanted to make sure we built the bank to have diversified revenue streams in any rate environment and just if you look at this quarter our net interest income to revenue was around which means we have worth of noninterest income a year ago march of our net interest income represented of our revenue so what it does is it really hedges the business has really hedged the downside risk to margin and rates as it relates to correspondent its a record quarter our interest rate swap business was up from the fourth quarter which was a record quarter about million we also were pleased to see our fixed income business increased about million so that was about million is your number there in the future as we think about it coming off a record quarter im not going to be able to do that every quarter but we think the fixed incomes to continue to be a real positive the interest rate swap business will slow down as new purchases will not be as robust we will have to refinance this but we see that business slowing down some but still at a higher elevated pace so hopefully that helps you michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc all right that was great hey guys thanks for taking my questions robert r hill jr a chief executive officer director south state corp thank you michael operator and our next question comes from christopher marinac at janney montgomery scott llc please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks good morning and we really appreciate all the information that both companies provided on the disclosures i just wanted to ask more about kind of the deferrals and to what extent do we see that translate over time into criticizing classified loans or do you think that well see some catchup on those loan grades by the end of next quarter or will it take longer for that to play out john c pollok a chief financial officer director south state corp south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 hi chris this is john jonathan do you want to take a stab at that and then maybe dan can follow up jonathan s kivett a chief credit officer south state corp yeah sure i think initially were not going to see that change in grade i think over time and i think as the question is how long is it going to take i would say over the next two quarters youre going to start to see that catch up so most of our borrowers are under a 90day pi deferral so that pi deferral probably the vintage in that is call it midmarch so youre talking about midjune for the deferrals to come to an end and then were going to obviously be having ongoing conversations but i think at the end of that deferral period youre going to have so call it late second quarter early third quarter youre going to really start to know and hopefully were a little further through this pandemic we got a better understanding of how the economy is going to get kicked back into gear and the longterm outlook for some of these businesses is going to be better of these industries so well know a lot better so i think  end of  might be a little early but im certainly thinking that  will have a real good gauge on longterm prospects and grades john c pollok a chief financial officer director south state corp dan daniel e bockhorst a executive vice president chief credit officer centerstate bank na winter haven yeah ill echo some of the same timing as jonathan remind everybody from a regulatory perspective the regulators gave guidance that six months was kind of a timeframe that they were looking at before something would be classified as a pdr the majority of ours are in a 90day deferral at the end of that days well evaluate if another days is needed at that time maybe theres an opportunity to shore up with additional collateral additional guarantor support i would say that a lot of the ones that are getting deferrals do have solid guarantor support with strong liquidity but we dont think theres going to be significant impact to the risk weighting longterm robert r hill jr a chief executive officer director south state corp and chris this is robert id just kind of add on to what they said i think trying to draw correlation between deferral and loss or problem loans at this stage is just not really a leap you can make i think its a unique situation were handling some industries in a unique way but i think as dan said well the guarantor support and the liquidity that they have we feel really good about in fact the larger ones are the ones that are really well positioned and most of these have significant equity and significant guarantor strength so some of the smaller ones actually could be the ones that struggle so i think thats why it gets back to trying to make a correlation between the two most of our markets dont have significant covid impact its not manhattan so where youve obviously got youve got a significant impact so we feel like over a certain period of time these businesses will begin to reopen and be able to operate and pay principal interest on the normal payment without having occupancy like they have used to so i think thats why we felt like we needed a proactive engaged approach with the customer it was just a better approach and i just think its way too early to try to draw a correlation between the deferrals and any future problem asset south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc sounds good i appreciate that background a lot thanks operator and our next question today comes from jennifer demba at suntrust please go ahead jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you good morning robert r hill jr a chief executive officer director south state corp good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc will does all thats going on right now with the pandemic and the shutdown does that change at all the timing on the merger cost saving now you said the closing should happen on time william e matthews a chief financial officer centerstate bank na winter haven yeah jennifer i think youre going to hear a theme depending upon how many questions we take today that will state couple of things one were focused on our teams and were focused on our customers and you also hear us say that we think this is a pretty significant opportunity really a generational opportunity for us to seize the moment to strengthen our bonds with our customers and with our team members and obviously as john alluded to when he talked about the ppp process weve had to all convert an assembly line thats used to churning out certain number of larger units per day and the one churning out multiple multiple multiple numbers of smaller units with different forms and whatnot a day and done a great job of doing that so weve been focused on those things so we have delayed some of our integration planning as part of that where but if you recall from our earlier announcement we werent expecting to see much of the bulk of the cost saves until sometime mid next year we do have a conversion date as you see in the deck in the early second quarter of next year we are sometimes to second quarter that is really going to drive a lot of the cost saves so while i think were more focused right now on taking this opportunity to build bonds with two very important constituents we are still very focused on the benefits that this merger forged us in cost saves to both institution particularly in time where pretax preprovision income may be more challenging for some we are very very glad to have that opportunity to help boost our profitability when we get through conversion jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc does the circumstances now with using the physical branches less and doing it more in drivethrough or by appointment does that make you rethink i know you did you dont have a lot of branch overlap between the two companies but did that make you rethink the branch network longerterm south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 john c pollok a chief financial officer director south state corp jennifer robert r hill jr a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah id say go ahead john c pollok a chief financial officer director south state corp yeah jennifer this is john and maybe robert will have a thought here as well my guess is that this pandemic is going to change and accelerate the way a lot of things occur and i think it really will be an acceleration of an adoption of the digital channels that weve all been working towards so i dont know if theres anything immediate in our thought process relative to branches but i do see an acceleration of the path that we were already on robert anything to add there robert r hill jr a chief executive officer director south state corp somewhat to johns comment i mean i think jennifer just to maybe talk about just the deal overall not just the expense save number is i think what john and i were talking about this over the last couple of years we kind of both felt that we were at the end of the cycle now we obviously with what were going through right now nobody could have recognized but clearly we were in the cycle and one of the things that we had hoped putting our companies together was that we could whatever economic downturn there was be it deeper or shallow that we would come out the other side stronger so theres kind of the shortterm economic impact and then we have an opportunity to manage through theres the longterm change in the whole business model and were hearing that not just from ourselves and our bank but from our customers as well theyre looking at the shortterm economic impact but the longterm structural impact for their businesses so one of our challenges was how do you make this thing how do you digitize more of the bank and we have encouraged pushed had adoptions and over a three or five or seven year period we thought we could really make some good games there well i think this is going to accelerate it significantly so just data points but march of this year we did more in digital deposits than we did march of last year that was a increase and so were seeing how we can run this company in a very different way and have adoption of these digital products is going to accelerate so i think that all the things we thought would happen thered be a downturn that there would be digital adoption i just think all those things are going to happen but just at a much faster pace and it creates some opportunities for us on that path jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you so much operator and our next question today comes from kevin fitzsimmons at da davidson please go ahead south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co good morning everyone john c corbett a president chief executive officer centerstate bank na winter haven good morning robert r hill jr a chief executive officer director south state corp hey kevin kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co i just had a quick followup question i believe it was john that mentioned earlier about the origination fee coming through whether thats in third quarter or some a little later and that that pays a lot of bills and so just in that line of thinking should we not be viewing that as necessarily flow into the bottom line that some of that can be used for incremental expenses that youll have whether thatd be compensating some of your frontline employees whether itd be additional reserve building like you referred to just how we should be looking at that thanks john c pollok a chief financial officer director south state corp yeah this is john pollock to be clear so that million a little over million pays really for all the expense with it the only caveat as you know the rules continue to change and so what we have to establish a loan loss reserves so i think our view today is of that field come through the next couple of quarters and then or so would come back over the next year to year and a half as the loans repaid but clearly its net of the operating expenses stephen dean young a chief operating officer executive vice president centerstate bank na winter haven yes and kevin this is steve well same as you we would have as far as how that gets forgiven over time at least what we know today this interstate number depending on funding could be in the mid after expenses but thats going to happen as john mentioned over time so hard to really predict it william e matthews a chief financial officer centerstate bank na winter haven and ill just add on this is will you asked about provision obviously the level of provision expenses uncorrelated without it i mean it certainly provides another source of revenue that could help fund any necessary provision expense but those would be independent decisions from one another of course kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co got it thank you and then just one quick followup on deferred loan process you detailed before how youre proactively reaching out to customers in some of those atrisk industries but for larger credits that come to you guys are you going through some kind of creditdriven process in terms of scrutinizing that just trying to get a sense of what youre going through thanks south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 24apr2020 john c pollok a chief financial officer director south state corp maybe dan you want to start there daniel e bockhorst a executive vice president chief credit officer centerstate bank na winter haven yeah were taking a disciplined approach on analyzing that i have an honest frank
