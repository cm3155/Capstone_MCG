of operations for the quarter ended march compared to the quarter ended march and also analyzes our financial condition as of march as compared to december like most financial institutions we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits on which we may pay interest consequently one of the key measures of our success is the amount of our net interest income or the difference between the income on our interestearning assets such as loans and investments and the expense on our interestbearing liabilities such as deposits another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interestearning assets and the rate we pay on our interestbearing liabilities of course there are risks inherent in all loans as such we maintain an allowance for credit losses otherwise referred to herein as acl to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible we establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for credit losses against our operating earnings in the following discussion we have included a detailed discussion of this process in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers we incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits we describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following discussion the following sections also identify significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report recent events regulatory considerations in the aftermath of the recent bank failures we expect that the banking agencies will propose certain actions including special assessments to repay losses to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdics deposit insurance fund it is not yet possible to quantify the impact of these potential actions liquidity and capital during the current quarter the financial markets experienced some volatility in response to a small number of regional bank failures resulting from deposit runs generally related to high concentrations in particular customer segments high levels of uninsured deposits and failures in interest rate risk management deposit flows are significantly influenced by general and local economic conditions changes in prevailing interest rates internal pricing decisions and competition our deposits are primarily obtained from depositors located around our branch footprint and we believe that we have attractive opportunities to capture additional retail and commercial deposits in our markets in addition to having access to brokered deposits at march we had billion in total deposits of which approximately were insured or collateralized our deposit base is comprised of million accounts with an average deposit size of our top and deposit relationships represent and respectively of total deposits in addition to deposits we have other contingency funding sources available to the bank at march our bank had a total fhlb credit facility of billion with million in fhlb advances and million in fhlb letters of credit outstanding at quarterend leaving billion in availability on the fhlb credit facility in addition our bank had billion of credit available at the federal reserve banks discount window and total federal funds credit lines of million with no balances outstanding at quarterend the bank also has an internal limit on brokered deposits of of total deposits which would allow capacity of billion as of march the bank had billion of outstanding brokered deposits at the end of the quarter leaving billion in available capacity all of these resources would provide an additional billion in funding if the bank needed additional liquidity in addition the bank also has billion in unpledged securities at march that can be pledged to obtain additional funds if necessary the company has a million unsecured line of credit with us bank national association with no balance outstanding at march we believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available in addition to adequate liquidity the company and bank are considered well capitalized by all regulatory capital standards as it was significantly above the required capital levels as of march the companys tier leverage ratio common equity tier cet riskbased capital ratio and total riskbased capital ratio were and respectively at march the banks tier leverage ratio cet riskbased capital ratio and total riskbased capital ratio were and respectively at march as permitted we elected to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to available for sale securities from tier cet and total riskbased capital however even if our unrealized losses as of march in our available for sale and held to maturity investment portfolios were recognized by selling the portfolios for liquidity purposes all else being equal our regulatory capital ratios would remain well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the well capitalized regulatory classification atlantic capital bancshares inc atlantic capital merger on march the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of atlantic capital in a stock transaction upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein atlantic capital merged with and into the company with the company continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger immediately following the merger atlantic capitals wholly owned

program ppp loans at fair value net of million or estimated discount to the outstanding principal balance representing of the companys total loans at december of the total loans acquired management identified million that had more than insignificantly deteriorated since origination and were thus determined to be pcd loans additional details regarding the atlantic capital merger are discussed in note mergers and acquisitions critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and follow general practices within the banking industry our financial position and results of operations are affected by managements application of accounting policies including estimates assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses differences in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and related disclosures understanding our accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations accordingly our significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies and note recent accounting and regulatory pronouncements of our consolidated financial statements in this quarterly report on form 10q and in note summary of significant accounting policies of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates assumptions and judgments business combinations we account for acquisitions under fasb asc topic business combinations which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting all identifiable assets acquired including loans and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value we adopted asu financial instruments credit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments on january which now requires us to record purchased financial assets with credit deterioration pcd assets defined as a morethaninsignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination or issuance at the purchase price plus the allowance for credit losses expected at the time of acquisition under this method there is no provision for credit losses affecting net income on acquisition of pcd assets changes in estimates of expected credit losses after acquisition are recognized as provision for credit loss expense or recovery of credit losses in subsequent periods as they arise any noncredit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets with credit deterioration shall be allocated to each individual asset at the acquisition date the initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis shall be allocated to individual assets to appropriately allocate any noncredit discount or premium the noncredit discount or premium after the adjustment for the allowance for credit losses shall be accreted into interest income using the interest method based on the effective interest rate determined after the adjustment for credit losses at the adoption date a purchased financial asset that does not qualify as a pcd asset is accounted for similar to an originated financial asset generally this means that an entity recognizes the allowance for credit losses for nonpcd assets through net income at the time of acquisition in addition both the credit discount and noncredit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets that do not qualify as pcd assets shall be allocated to each individual asset this combined discount or premium shall be accreted into interest income using the effective yield method for further discussion of our loan accounting and acquisitions see note 2summary of significant accounting policies note 4mergers and acquisitions note 6loans and note 7allowance for credit losses allowance for credit losses or acl the acl reflects managements estimate of expected credit losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments management used the systematic methodology to determine its acl for loans held for investment and certain offbalancesheet credit exposures management considers the effects of past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio the companys estimate of its acl involves a high degree of judgment therefore managements process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses it is possible that others given the same information may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion the companys acl recorded on the balance sheet reflects managements best estimate within the range of expected credit losses the company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the acl for managements current estimate of expected credit losses see note summary of significant accounting policies in this quarterly report on form 10q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the acl see also note allowance for credit losses in this quarterly report on form 10q and allowance for credit losses in this mda goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed in a business combination as of march and december the balance of goodwill was billion goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets fair value we evaluated the carrying value of goodwill as of october our annual test date and determined that no impairment charge was necessary we continue to monitor the impact of current economic conditions and other events on the companys business operating results cash flows and financial condition core deposit intangibles and client list intangibles consist primarily of amortizing assets established during the acquisition of other banks for the period ending march and december the core deposit intangibles totaled million and million respectively this includes whole bank acquisitions and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities from other financial institutions core deposit intangibles represent the estimated value of longterm deposit relationships acquired in these transactions client list intangibles represent the value of longterm client relationships for the correspondent banking and wealth and trust management business these costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives such as deposit accounts in the case of core deposit intangible on a method that we believe reasonably approximates the anticipated benefit stream from this intangible the estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness income taxes and deferred tax assets income taxes are provided for the tax effects of the transactions reported in our consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related to differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of certain assets and liabilities including loans available for sale securities acl write downs of oreo properties and bank properties held for sale accumulated depreciation net operating loss carry forwards accretion income deferred compensation intangible assets mortgage servicing rights and postretirement benefits the deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled a valuation allowance is recorded in situations where it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset is not realizable as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes deferred tax assets as of march were million which was down slightly from million as of december the decrease in deferred tax assets during the first three months of was mostly attributable to a decrease in the unrealized losses in the securities portfolio an increase in deferred loan fees and costs partially offset by an increase in the allowance for credit losses the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return additionally income tax returns are filed by the company or its subsidiaries in the states of alabama arkansas arizona california colorado florida georgia illinois indiana minnesota mississippi missouri new jersey new york north carolina south carolina tennessee texas and virginia and city of new york city we evaluate the need for income tax reserves related to uncertain income tax positions but had no material reserves at march or december results of operations overview we reported consolidated net income of million or diluted earnings per share eps of for the first quarter of as compared to consolidated net income of million or diluted eps of in the comparable period of a increase in consolidated net income and a increase in diluted eps the million increase in consolidated net income was the net result of the following items a million increase in interest income resulting from a million increase in interest income from loans and loans held for sale a million increase in interest income from investment securities and a million increase in interest income on federal funds sold securities purchased under agreement to resell and interestbearing deposits these increases were mainly due to the increase in yields in all categories of interestearning assets in the current rising rate environment as the federal reserve bank has raised it federal funds rate basis points in and the first quarter of the increase in interest income is also due to the increase in the average balance of loans of billion through both organic loan growth and loans acquired through the atlantic capital acquisition during the first quarter of a million increase in interest expense which resulted from a million increase in interest expense from deposits a million increase in interest expense in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and a million increase in interest expense from corporate and subordinated debentures and other borrowings these increases in expense resulted mainly from an increase in costs of all categories of interestbearing liabilities as interest rates have increased in and this increase in average cost of interestbearing liabilities was particularly felt in the first quarter of with the stress in financial markets and liquidity as the average cost increased basis points compared to the fourth quarter of a million increase in the provision for allowance for credit losses as the company recorded provision for credit losses of million in the first quarter of while recording a release of the allowance for credit losses of million in the first quarter of as the economy continued to stabilize from the covid19 pandemic and economic forecasts improved the company continued to release allowance for credit losses in the first quarter of that were built in during the pandemic in the first quarter of we recorded a provision for allowance for credit losses as economic forecasts reflected the continued stress of inflation and rising interest rates that began in mid a million decrease in noninterest income primarily from a decline in mortgage banking income of million and correspondent banking and capital market income of million these decreases were partially offset by increases of million in fees on deposit accounts and a million increase in other noninterest income driven by an increase of million in income from bank owned life insurance and a million legal settlement see noninterest income section on page for further discussion an million increase in noninterest expense which resulted primarily from an increase in salaries and employee benefits of million in fdic assessment and other regulatory charges of million and in other noninterest expense of million driven by an increase in business development and staff related expense of million an increase in other taxes of million and million increase in expense related to our earnings credit program for certain deposit accounts see noninterest expense section on page for further discussion and higher income tax provision of million primarily due to higher pretax book income between the two quarters the company recorded pretax book income of million in the first quarter of compared to pretax book income of million in the first quarter of our effective tax rate was for the three months ended march compared to for the three months ended march our quarterly efficiency ratio decreased to in the first quarter of compared to in the first quarter of the decrease in the efficiency ratio compared to the first quarter of was the result of the increase in the total of taxequivalent net interest income and noninterest income being greater than the increase in noninterest expense excluding amortization of intangibles of the increase in income was mainly due to a increase in taxequivalent net interest income reflective of the rising rate environment where our interestearning assets repriced more quickly than our interestbearing liabilities basic and diluted eps were and respectively for the first quarter of compared to and respectively for the first quarter of the increase in basic and diluted eps was due to a increase in net income in the first quarter of compared to the same period in partially offset by an increase in average basic common shares of the increase in net income was mainly due to the

equity both increased in from but at lower percentages of and respectively the equitytoassets ratio was for the three months ended march an increase of from march which was mainly due to the increase in total equity of resulting from the net income earned during the last twelve months dividend payout ratios were for the threemonth period ending march and for the threemonth period ending march the

raise rates in with two increases of basis points the most recent in early march resulting in a range of to at march as a result the company operated under an increasing rate environment for the first quarter of while it operated under a much lower rate environment in the first quarter of some key highlights are outlined below nontax equivalent te and te net interest margin increased by basis points and basis points respectively in the first quarter of compared to the same quarter of due to the increase in the yield on interest earning assets of basis points which was only partially offset by the increase in the cost of interestbearing liabilities of basis points in the rising rate environment in and the first quarter of our interestearning assets specifically our loans repriced more quickly than our interestbearing liabilities specifically our deposits leading to the increase in net interest margin o nonte yield on interestearning assets for the first quarter of increased basis points to from the comparable period in primarily due to higher yields on all interestearning assets as the federal reserve bank raised interest rates basis points starting late in first quarter of the increases in interest rates in combination with the increase in the average balance of the higher yielding loan portfolio of billion along with the decline in the average balance of lower yielding interestearning deposits and federal funds sold of billion affected the overall yield increase between the comparable periods o the average cost of interestbearing liabilities for the first quarter of increased basis points from the same period in this increase was driven by the effects from the rising rate environment on the repricing of all deposit accounts federal funds purchased and securities purchased with agreement to repurchase and trust preferred corporate debt the average cost of interestbearing deposits increased basis points as the increase occurred in all deposit categories the average cost of federal funds purchased and securities purchased with agreement to repurchase increased basis points while the average cost of corporate and subordinated debentures increased basis points other borrowings consisting of fhlb advances had an average cost of during the first quarter of the increase in overall average cost of interestbearing liabilities was also due to the decrease in the average balance of lower costing transaction and money market deposit accounts along with savings deposit accounts while the higher costing certificates and other time deposits and other

compared to the same period in due to a basispoint increase in the yield on the acquired loan portfolio and a basispoint increase in yield on the nonacquired loan portfolio these increases in both portfolios were due to the rising rate environment o the yield on the acquired loan portfolio increased basis points to in the first quarter of from in the same period in interest income on the acquired loan portfolio increased million during the same period the yield and interest income on acquired loans increased due to the rising rate environment in effect during the current quarter of the bank was operating under a lower rate environment during the first quarter of as the federal reserve did not begin increasing interest rates until midmarch further the loan accretion income increased by during the first quarter of compared to the same period in due to the first quarter of having a full quarter of loan accretion from the atlantic capital transaction while the first quarter of only had one month of loan accretion for the a cquired loans the increase in interest income from the increase in yield was partially offset by the average balance decreasing by billion from the first quarter of this decrease was mainly related to the impact from the paydowns and payoffs of loans along with renewals of acquired loans that were moved to our nonacquired loan portfolio o the yield on the nonacquired loan portfolio increased basis points to in the first quarter of compared to in the same period in interest income on the nonacquired loan portfolio increased million during the same period the yield and interest income on nonacquired loans increased due to the rising rate environment during and the first quarter of as the federal reserve increased interest rates basis points both new loans and renewal have repriced in a much higher rate environment resulting in a higher yield for the nona cquired loans interest income increased due to an increase in the average loan balance of billion in the first quarter of compared to the same period in primarily through organic loan growth and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our nonacquired loan portfolio interestbearing liabilities the quartertodate average balance of interestbearing liabilities decreased million or in the first quarter of compared to the same period in the cost of

expense on interestbearing deposits increased by million in the first quarter of compared to the same period in as interest expense on all interestbearing deposit accounts increased interest expense on transaction and money market accounts savings and certificates and other time deposits increased million million and million respectively the increase in the cost and interest expense was due to the repricing of deposits in the rising rate environment in and the first quarter of o the average balance of interestbearing deposits decreased by million as interestbearing transaction accounts and money market accounts and savings accounts declined by million partially offset by an increase in certificate and other time deposits of million as customers moved funds from interestbearing checking and savings accounts seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment and deposit insurance coverage the company increased its balance in brokered time deposits and in inmarket time deposits in march of brokered deposits increased from million to billion to replace the decline in interestbearing transaction and savings accounts this shift from the lower costing interestbearing transaction accounts money market accounts and savings accounts to the higher costing time deposits increased both the overall cost of deposits and interest expense overall interestbearing deposits had been slower to reprice in the rising rate environment but the cost had begun to increase significantly in the fourth quarter of and the effects were more significant in the first quarter of the cost on the corporate and subordinated debt increased by basis points for the three months ended march compared to the same period in driven by the effects from the rising rate environment on the repricing of variable rate trust preferred corporate debt o the interest expense from corporate and subordinated debt increased million during the first quarter of compared to the same period in o the average

transaction accounts that provide our bank with interestfree sources of funds average noninterestbearing deposits increased million or to billion in the first quarter of compared to billion during the same period in the increase in average noninterestbearing deposits was primarily due to the assumed noninterestbearing deposit balances from atlantic capital which only affected the average balance for the last days of the first quarter of the noninterestbearing deposit balances from atlantic capital on the acquisition date were approximately billion in total actual noninterestbearing deposits declined million from december this decline was due to both the rising rate environment as customers seek higher yields in addition to some customers spreading deposit funds amongst institutions to achieve full deposit insurance coverage noninterest income noninterest income provides us with additional revenues that are significant sources of income for the three months ended march and

allocation declined from in the first quarter of to in the first quarter of the allocation of mortgage production between portfolio and secondary market depends on the companys liquidity market spreads and rate changes during each period and will fluctuate quarter to quarter both the decline in mortgage production and the decline in allocation to the secondary market led to the decline in mortgage banking income o the decrease in mortgage income from the secondary market was comprised of a million decline in gain on sale of mortgage loans which is net of the commission expense related

rate was for the three months ended march compared to for the three months ended march the increase in the effective rate for the quarter when compared to the same period in the prior year is driven by an increase in pretax income an increase in stock based compensation an increase in disallowed interest expense and an increase in nondeductible fdic premiums partially offset by a decrease in

total number of investment securities with an unrealized loss position decreased by securities while the total dollar amount of the unrealized loss decreased by million the level of unrealized losses

of at december allowance for credit losses acl the acl reflects managements estimate of losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments the company established the incremental increase in the acl at adoption through equity and subsequent adjustments through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings the company records loans charged off against the acl and subsequent recoveries if any increase the acl when they are recognized please see note significant accounting policies in this quarterly report on form 10q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the acl as stated in note significant accounting policies under the caption allowance for credit losses management uses systematic methodologies to determine its acl for loans held for investment and certain offbalancesheet credit exposures the acl is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loan portfolio management considers the effects of past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio the companys estimate of its acl involves a high degree of judgment therefore managements process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses the companys acl recorded in the balance sheet reflects managements best estimate within the range of expected credit losses the company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the acl for managements current estimate of expected credit losses the companys acl is calculated using collectively evaluated and individually evaluated loans the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist loans with similar risk characteristics are grouped into homogenous segments or pools for analysis the discounted cash flow dcf method is used for each loan in a pool and the results are aggregated at the pool level a periodic tendency to default and absolute loss given default are applied to a projective model of the loans cash flow while considering prepayment and principal curtailment effects the analysis produces expected cash flows for each instrument in the pool by pairing loanlevel term information eg maturity date payment amount interest rate etc with topdown pool assumptions eg default rates and prepayment speeds the company has identified the following portfolio segments owneroccupied commercial real estate non owneroccupied commercial real estate multifamily municipal commercial and industrial commercial construction and land development residential construction residential senior mortgage residential junior mortgage revolving mortgage and consumer and other in determining the proper level of the acl management has determined that the loss experience of the bank provides the best basis for its assessment of expected credit losses the company therefore used its own historical credit loss experience by each loan segment over an economic cycle while excluding loss experience from certain acquired institutions ie failed banks for most of the segment models for collectively evaluated loans the company incorporated two or more macroeconomic drivers using a statistical regression modeling methodology management considers forwardlooking information in estimating expected credit losses the company subscribes to a thirdparty service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the united states economy the baseline along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios is used by management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses management evaluates the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and takes into consideration the scenarios in relation to actual economic and other data such as gross domestic product growth monetary and fiscal policy inflation supply chain issues and global events like the russianukraine conflict as well as the volatility and magnitude of changes within those scenarios quarter over quarter and consideration of conditions within the banks operating environment and geographic area additional forecast scenarios may be weighted along with the baseline forecast to arrive at the final reserve estimate while periods of relative economic stability should generally lead to stability in forecast scenarios and weightings to estimate credit losses periods of instability can likewise require management to adjust the selection of scenarios and weightings in accordance with the accounting standards for the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period the company reverts to the long term mean of historical factors within four quarters using a straightline approach the company generally uses a fourquarter forecast and a fourquarter reversion period it is widely acknowledged that the chances of recession are still high accordingly management continues to use a blended forecast scenario of the baseline and more severe scenario depending on the circumstances and economic outlook for the quarter ending march management selected a baseline weighting of a weighting for an upside scenario and a weighting for the more severe scenario compared to a baseline weighting of and the more severe scenario of at the end of the fourth quarter of the shift in weightings among the three scenarios reflects recognition of downside risks in the economic forecast from persistent levels of inflation and rising interest rates geopolitical tension and the russian invasion of ukraine and global supply chain energy and commodity issues the more severe scenario reflected a moderate increase in severity from the prior quarter and was viewed as less likely by management while employment figures still showed resilience and actual loan losses remain at very low levels moderate downward shifts in forecasted commercial real estate price index national house price index and gdp in the more severe scenario increased expected loss rates primarily for commercial construction and commercial real estate loans the resulting provision was approximately million during the first quarter of including a provision for unfunded commitments of million included in its systematic methodology to determine its acl management considers the need to qualitatively adjust expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process these qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation ie formulaic model results each period the company considers qualitative factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework that includes the following lending policy economic conditions not captured in models volume and mix of loan portfolio past due trends concentration risk external factors and model limitations when a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with its segment the asset is assessed to determine whether it should be included in another pool or should be individually evaluated the companys threshold for individually evaluated loans includes all nonaccrual loans with a net book balance in excess of million management will monitor the credit environment and make adjustments to this threshold in the future if warranted based on the threshold above consumer financial assets will generally remain in pools unless they meet the dollar threshold the expected credit losses on individually evaluated loans will be estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis unless the loan meets the criteria for use of the fair value of collateral either by virtue of an expected foreclosure or through meeting the definition of collateraldependent financial assets that have been individually evaluated can be returned to a pool for purposes of estimating the expected credit loss insofar as their credit profile improves and the repayment terms were not considered to be unique to the asset management measures expected credit losses over the contractual term of a loan when determining the contractual term the company considers expected prepayments but is precluded from considering expected extensions renewals or modifications in the course of resolving issues where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties the bank may choose to modify the contractual terms of certain loans longstanding tdr accounting rules were replaced with asu no financial instruments credit losses topic troubled debt restructurings and vintage disclosures see note recent accounting pronouncements the company adopted the retirement of tdr guidance effective january in accordance with the adoption of asu any loans modified to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty are reviewed by the bank to determine if an interest rate reduction a term extension an otherthaninsignificant payment delay a principal forgiveness or any combination of these has occurred the acl includes expected losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty losses on modifications over million to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are estimated on an individual basis because the effect of the remainder of modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already incorporated into the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance they are accounted for as pooled loans for purchased creditdeteriorated otherwise referred to herein as pcd assets are defined as acquired individual financial assets or acquired groups of financial assets with similar risk characteristics that as of the date of acquisition have experienced a morethaninsignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination as determined by the companys assessment the company records acquired pcd loans by adding the expected credit losses ie allowance for credit losses to the purchase price of the financial assets rather than recording through the provision for credit losses in the income statement the expected credit loss as of the acquisition day of a pcd loan is added to the allowance for credit losses the noncredit discount or premium is the difference between the unpaid principal balance and the amortized cost basis as of the acquisition date subsequent to the acquisition date the change in the acl on pcd loans is recognized through the provision for credit losses the noncredit discount or premium is accreted or amortized respectively into interest income over the remaining life of the pcd loan on a levelyield basis in accordance with the transition requirements within the standard the companys acquired creditimpaired loans ie aci or purchased credit impaired were treated as pcd loans as a result of the merger with atlantic capital on march the company identified approximately million of loans as pcd and recorded an allowance for credit losses of million on acquisition date atlantic capital was acquired and merged with and into the bank on march requiring that a closing date acl be prepared for atlantic capital on a standalone basis and that the acquired portfolio be included in the banks first quarter acl atlantic capitals loans represented approximately of the total banks portfolio at march given the relative size and complexity of the acquired portfolio similarities of the loan characteristics and similar loss history to the existing portfolio reserve calculations were performed using the banks existing cecl model loan segmentation and forecast weighting as the first quarter end reserve the acquisition date acl totaled million consisting of a nonpcd pooled reserve of million pcd pooled reserve of million and pcd individually evaluated reserve of million it represented about of the combined banks acl reserve at march the acquisition date reserve for unfunded commitments totaled million or of the combined banks total at march the company follows its nonaccrual policy by reversing contractual interest income in the income statement when the company places a loan on nonaccrual status therefore management excludes the accrued interest receivable balance from the amortized cost basis in measuring expected credit losses on the portfolio and does not record an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable as of march the accrued interest receivable for loans recorded in other assets was million the company has a variety of assets that have a component that qualifies as an offbalance sheet exposure these primarily include undrawn portions of revolving lines of credit and standby letters of credit the expected losses associated with these exposures within the unfunded portion of the expected credit loss will be recorded as a liability on the balance sheet management has determined that a majority of the companys offbalancesheet credit exposures are not unconditionally cancellable management completes funding studies based on historical data to estimate the percentage of unfunded loan commitments that will ultimately be funded to calculate the reserve for unfunded commitments management applies this funding rate along with the loss factor rate determined for each pooled loan segment to unfunded loan commitments excluding unconditionally cancellable exposures and letters of credit to arrive at the reserve for unfunded loan commitments as of march the liability recorded for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments was million the current adjustment to the acl for unfunded commitments is recognized through the provision for credit losses in the condensed consolidated statements of net income the company did not have an allowance for credit losses or record a provision for credit losses on investment securities or other financials asset during and as of march the balance of the acl was million or of total loans the acl increased million from the balance of million recorded at december this increase during the first quarter of included a million provision in addition to million in net chargeoffs at march the company had a reserve on unfunded commitments of million which was recorded as a liability on the balance sheet compared to million at december during three months ended march the company recorded an increase in the reserve for unfunded commitments of million this amount was recorded in provision recovery for

quality numbers and ratios as of march the following table provides the allocation by segment for expected credit losses because ppp loans are government guaranteed and management implemented

loans of million an increase in accruing loans past due days or more of offset by a decline in restructured nonaccrual loans of million the increase in commercial nonaccrual loans at march was

nonaccrual loans of million a decrease in restructured loans of million and a decline in accruing loans past due days or more of million the decline in restructured loans over both the nonacquired and

highlights are outlined below the increase in interestbearing deposits from december was driven by an increase in time deposits of billion including an increase in brokered time deposits of billion the increase in time deposits was mostly offset by declines in interest bearing checking deposits of million and savings deposits of million as customers moved funds from interest bearing checking and savings accounts seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment and deposit insurance coverage the company increased its balance in brokered time deposits along with growth in inmarket time deposits during the quarter the company raised interest rates on most interestbearing deposit products in particular time deposit specials during the quarter due to competitive pressures to retain deposits average interestbearing deposits decreased billion to billion in the quarter ended march compared to the same period in for more information on the composition of our total deposits see note deposits in this quarterly report on form 10q other borrowings consisting of fhlb borrowings increased to million at march from at december the company borrowed funds from the fhlb to provide excess liquidity during the first quarter of noninterestbearing deposits noninterestbearing deposits are transaction accounts that provide our bank with interestfree sources of funds at march the period end balance of noninterestbearing deposits was billion a decrease of million compared to billion at the december the decrease was mainly due to both customers seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment and deposit insurance coverage amid the financial turmoil during the quarter average noninterestbearing deposits were billion for the first quarter of compared to billion for the first quarter of this increase was mainly related to deposits acquired through the atlantic capital transaction the atlantic capital acquisition was completed on march therefore the acquired noninterestbearing deposits were only outstanding for days during the first quarter which resulted in a lower effect on the average balance uninsured deposits at march and december the company had approximately billion and billion respectively in estimated uninsured deposits since it is not reasonably practicable to provide a precise measure of uninsured deposits the amounts above are estimates

comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and tier minority interests tier capital generally includes the allowance for loan losses up to of riskweighted assets qualifying preferred stock subordinated debt trust preferred securities and qualifying tier minority interests less any deductions in tier instruments of an unconsolidated financial institution aoci is presumptively included in cet1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital when the current capital rules were first implemented the bank exercised its onetime opportunity at the end of the first quarter of for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of aoci allowing us to retain our preexisting treatment for aoci in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives a banking organization must maintain a capital conservation buffer on top of its minimum riskbased capital requirements this buffer must consist solely of tier common equity but the buffer applies to all three riskbased measurements cet1 tier capital and total capital resulting in the following effective minimum capital plus capital conservation buffer ratios i a cet1 capital ratio of ii a tier riskbased capital ratio of and iii a total riskbased capital ratio of the bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action which identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized and is based on specified thresholds for each of the three riskbased regulatory capital ratios cet1 tier capital and total capital and for the leverage ratio the federal banking agencies revised their regulatory capital rules to i address the implementation of cecl ii provide an optional threeyear phasein period for the adoption date adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting cecl and iii require the use of cecl in stress tests beginning with the capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations that are subject to stress testing cecl became effective for us on january and the company applied the provisions of the standard using the modified retrospective method as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings related to the implementation of asu we recorded additional allowance for credit losses for loans of million deferred tax assets of million an additional reserve for unfunded commitments of million and an adjustment to retained earnings of million instead of recognizing the effects on regulatory capital from asu at adoption the company initially elected the option for recognizing the adoption date effects on the companys regulatory capital calculations over a threeyear phasein in in response to the covid19 pandemic the federal banking agencies issued a final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of cecl the final rule provides banking organizations that adopt cecl in the calendar year with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital followed by the aforementioned threeyear transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of benefit during the initial twoyear delay for a total fiveyear transition the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital modified cecl transitional amount is calculated as the sum of the adoption date impact on retained earnings upon adoption of cecl cecl transitional amount and the calculated change in the acl relative to the adoption date acl upon adoption of cecl multiplied by a scaling factor of the scaling factor is used to approximate the difference in the acl under cecl relative to the incurred loss methodology the company chose the fiveyear transition method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from the adoption date and the cecl difference for the first two years of application the modified cecl transitional amount was calculated each quarter for the first two years of the fiveyear transition this amount was fixed as of december and that amount began the threeyear phase out in the first quarter of with being phased out in the wellcapitalized minimums and the companys and the banks regulatory capital ratios for the following periods are reflected below wellcapitalized march december minimums southstate corporation common equity tier riskbased capital na tier riskbased capital total riskbased capital tier leverage na southstate bank common equity tier riskbased capital tier riskbased capital total riskbased capital tier leverage the companys and banks common equity tier riskbased capital tier riskbased capital and total riskbased capital and tier leverage ratios all increased compared to december these ratios increased mainly due to net income during the quarter of million tier capital increased and at both the company and bank respectively with the increase in equity from net income total riskbased capital increased and at both the company and bank respectively with the increase in equity from net income along with the increase in the allowance for credit losses and unfunded commitments both regulatory riskbased assets and quarterly average assets remained reasonably flat compared to the fourth quarter with average assets for the company and bank decreasing and riskbased assets increasing our capital ratios are currently well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the well capitalized regulatory classification should the company need to sell its available for sale and held to maturity securities for liquidity purposes and recognize the unrealized losses as of march through earnings all else equal our capital ratios would remain well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the well capitalized regulatory classification liquidity liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits extension of credit and payment of operating expenses liquidity risk is the risk that the banks financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by an inability or perceived inability to meet its obligations our asset liability management committee alco is charged with the responsibility of monitoring policies designed to ensure acceptable composition of our assetliability mix two critical areas of focus for alco are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management we have employed our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs asset liquidity is maintained by the maturity structure of loans investment securities and other shortterm investments management has policies and procedures governing the length of time to maturity on loans and investments normally changes in the earning asset mix are of a longerterm nature and are not used for daytoday corporate liquidity needs our liabilities provide liquidity on a daytoday basis daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased securities sold under agreements to repurchase interestbearing deposits at other banks and other shortterm borrowings we engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position these routine activities include various measures such as the following emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with our bank pricing deposits including certificates of deposit at rate levels that will attract and or retain balances of deposits that will enhance our banks assetliability management and net interest margin requirements and continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our banks appeal as a primary provider of financial services our nonacquired loan portfolio increased by approximately million or approximately annualized compared to the balance at december the increase from december was mainly related to organic growth and renewals on acquired loans the acquired loan portfolio decreased by million from the balance at december through principal paydowns chargeoffs foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans our investment securities portfolio excluding trading securities decreased million compared to the balance at december the decrease in investment securities from december was a result of maturities calls sales and paydowns of investment securities totaling million as well as a reduction from the n et amortization of premiums of million these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the market value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio of million and purchases of fhlb stock of million there were no purchases of available for sale or held to maturity securities during the quarter total cash and cash equivalents were billion at march as compared to billion at december this increase was due to the company increasing its brokered time deposits by billion and borrowing million in fhlb borrowings during the quarter to increase liquidity at march and december we had billion and million of traditional outofmarket brokered time deposits respectively at march and december we had million and million respectively of reciprocal brokered deposits total deposits were billion at march an increase of million from billion at december this increase was driven by an increase in time deposits of billion including an increase in brokered time deposits of billion the increase in time deposits was mostly offset by declines in noninterest bearing deposits of million in interest bearing checking deposits of million and savings deposits of million as customers moved funds from noninterest bearing checking interest bearing checking and savings accounts seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment and deposit insurance coverage the company increased its balance in brokered time deposits and in inmarket time deposits the company raised interest rates on most interestbearing deposit products in particular time deposit specials during the quarter due to competitive pressures to retain deposits total corporate and subordinated debentures and other borrowings at march were billion and consisted of trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures of million and fhlb borrowings of million the company borrowed billion during the quarter and repaid billion prior to quarterend in fhlb borrowings to increase liquidity total shortterm borrowings at march were million consisting of million in federal funds purchased and million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase to the extent that we employ other types of nondeposit funding sources typically to accommodate retail and correspondent customers we continue to take in shorter maturities of such funds our current approach may provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise through the operations of our bank we have made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of our business activities these commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to our customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time we manage the credit risk on these commitments by subjecting them to normal underwriting and risk management processes we believe that we have adequate sources of liquidity to fund commitments that are drawn upon by the borrowers in addition to commitments to extend credit we also issue standby letters of credit which are assurances to third parties that they will not suffer a loss if our customer fails to meet its contractual obligation to the thirdparty although our experience indicates that many of these standby letters of credit will expire unused through our various sources of liquidity we believe that we will have the resources to meet these obligations should the need arise our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets typically including some level of reverse repurchase agreements federal funds sold balances at the federal reserve bank andor other shortterm investments asset quality wellcapitalized position and profitable operating results cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our desired liquidity position at any time we expect that these conditions would generally be of a shortterm nature under such circumstances we expect our reverse repurchase agreements and federal funds sold positions or balances at the federal reserve bank if any to serve as the primary source of immediate liquidity we could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks andor the fhlb at march our bank had a total fhlb credit facility of billion with million in fhlb advances and million fhlb letters of credit outstanding at quarterend leaving billion in availability on the fhlb credit facility at march our bank had billion of credit available at the federal reserve banks discount window and federal funds credit lines of million with no balances outstanding at quarterend the bank also has an internal limit on brokered deposits of of total deposits which would allow capacity of billion at march the bank has billion of outstanding brokered deposits at the end of the quarter leaving billion in available capacity all of these resources would provide an additional billion in funding if we needed additional liquidity the bank also has billion in unpledged securities at march that can be pledge to attain additional funds if necessary we can also consider actions such as deposit promotions to increase core deposits the company has a million unsecured line of credit with us bank national association with no balance outstanding at march we believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available our contingency funding plan describes several potential stages based on stressed liquidity levels liquidity key risk indicators are reported to the board of directors on a quarterly basis we maintain various wholesale sources of funding if our deposit retention efforts were to be unsuccessful we would use these alternative sources of funding under such circumstances depending on the external source of funds our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates charged this could increase our cost of funds impacting our net interest margin and net interest spread assetliability management and market risk sensitivity our earnings and the economic value of equity vary in relation to the behavior of interest rates and the accompanying fluctuations in market prices of certain of our financial instruments we define interest rate risk as the risk to earnings and equity arising from the behavior of interest rates these behaviors include increases and decreases in interest rates as well as continuation of the current interest rate environment our interest rate risk principally consists of reprice option basis and yield curve risk reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing characteristics of asset and liability portfolios option risk arises from embedded options in the investment and loan portfolios such as investment securities calls and loan prepayment options option risk also exists since deposit customers may withdraw funds at their discretion in response to general market conditions competitive alternatives to existing accounts or other factors the exercise of such options may result in higher costs or lower revenue basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices which subsequently result in narrowing spreads on interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities basis risk also exists in administered rate liabilities such as interestbearing checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts where the price sensitivity of such products may vary relative to general markets rates yield curve risk refers to adverse consequences of nonparallel shifts in the yield curves of various market indices that impact our assets and liabilities we use simulation analysis as a primary method to assess earnings at risk and equity at risk due to assumed changes in interest rates management uses the results of its various simulation analyses in combination with other data and observations to formulate strategies designed to maintain interest rate risk within risk tolerances simulation analysis involves the use of several assumptions including but not limited to the timing of cash flows such as the terms of contractual agreements investment security calls loan prepayment speeds deposit attrition rates the interest rate sensitivity of loans and deposits relative to general market rates and the behavior of interest rates and spreads equity at risk simulation uses assumptions regarding discount rates that value cash flows simulation analysis is highly dependent on model assumptions that may vary from actual outcomes key simulation assumptions are subject to sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of assumption changes on earnings at risk and equity at risk model assumptions are reviewed by our assumptions committee earnings at risk is defined as the percentage change in net interest income due to assumed changes in interest rates earnings at risk is generally used to assess interest rate risk over relatively short time horizons equity at risk is defined as the percentage change in the net economic value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value the discounted present value of all cash flows represents our economic value of equity equity at risk is generally considered a measure of the longterm interest rate exposures of the balance sheet at a point in time the earnings simulation models take into account our contractual agreements with regard to investments loans deposits borrowings and derivatives as well as a number of behavioral assumptions applied to certain assets and liabilities mortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist of forward sales contracts and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans these derivatives involve underlying items such as interest rates and are designed to mitigate risk derivatives are also used to hedge mortgage servicing rights for additional information see note 28derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements from time to time we execute interest rate swaps to hedge some of our interest rate risks under these arrangements the company enters into a variable rate loan with a client in addition to a swap agreement the swap agreement effectively converts the clients variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan the company then enters into a matching swap agreement with a thirdparty dealer to offset its exposure on the customer swap the company may also execute interest rate swap agreements that are not specific to client loans as of march the company did not have such agreements for additional information on these derivatives refer to note 28derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements our interest rate risk key indicators are applied to a static balance sheet using forward rates from the moodys baseline scenario the company will also use other rate forecasts including but not limited to moodys consensus scenario this base case scenario assumes the maturity composition of asset and liability rollover volumes is modeled to approximately replicate current consolidated balance sheet characteristics throughout the simulation these treatments are consistent with the companys goal of assessing current interest rate risk embedded in its current balance sheet the base case scenario assumes that maturing or repricing assets and liabilities are replaced at prices referencing forward rates derived from the selected rate forecast consistent with current balance sheet pricing characteristics key rate drivers are used to price assets and liabilities with sensitivity assumptions used to price nonmaturity deposits the sensitivity assumptions for the pricing of nonmaturity deposits are subjected to sensitivity analysis no less frequently than on an annual basis interest rate shocks are applied to the base case on an instantaneous basis our policy establishes the use of upward and downward interest rate shocks applied in basis point increments through basis points we calculate smaller rate shocks as needed at times market conditions may result in assumed rate movements that will be deemphasized for example during a period of ultralow interest rates certain downward rate shocks may be impractical the model simulation results produced from the base case scenario and related instantaneous shocks for changes in net interest income and changes in the economic value of equity are referred to as the core scenario analysis and constitute the policy key risk indicators for interest rate risk when compared to risk tolerances during the second quarter of management revised its deposit beta assumptions higher due to the rapid increase in interest rates and expected further increases from the beginning of the upward rate cycle our deposit costs have increased from five basis points to seventy basis points during this period the federal funds rate has increased basis points accordingly our cycle to date beta has been approximately management recognizes the difficulty using historical data to forecast deposit betas in the current environment for internal purposes we are assuming a beta of with a terminal federal funds rate of and a corresponding cumulative rate increase of basis points the following interest rate risk metrics are derived from analysis using the moodys consensus scenario published in april as the base case as of march the earnings simulations indicated that the year impact of an instantaneous basis point increase decrease in rates would result in an estimated increase up and decrease down in net interest income we use economic value of equity eve analysis as an indicator of the extent to which the present value of our capital could change given potential changes in interest rates this measure also assumes a static balance sheet base case scenario with rate shocks applied as described above at march the percentage change in eve due to a 100basis point increase or decrease in interest rates was decrease and decrease respectively the percentage changes in eve due to a 200basis point increase or decrease in interest rates were decrease and decrease respectively the interest rate shock analysis results for eve sensitivities are unusual as the benefits of repricing assets are mitigated by increasing deposit costs and downward shocks are constrained on various balance sheet categories due to the inability to price products below floors or zero this is particularly meaningful given the cost of deposits as of march the analysis below reflects a base case and shocked scenarios that assume a static balance sheet projection where volume is added to maintain balances consistent with current levels except for ppp loans that are not assumed to be replaced base case assumes new and repricing volumes reference forward rates derived from the moodys consensus rate forecast instantaneous parallel and sustained interest rate shocks are applied to the base case scenario over a oneyear time horizon percentage change in net interest income over one year up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points libor transition while most libor settings ceased to be provided or were no longer representative after december for the most common tenors of us dollar libor the administrator of libor extended publication until june the alternative reference rates committee proposed secured overnight financing rate sofr as its preferred rate as an alternative to libor and proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from libor organizations are currently working on industrywide and companyspecific transition plans related to derivatives and cash markets exposed to libor as noted within part i item risk factors of the form 10k for the year ended we hold instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of libor including floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and hedges and other financial instruments but is not able to currently predict the associated financial impact of the transition to an alternative reference rate we have established a crossfunctional libor transition working group that has assessed the companys current exposure to libor indexed instruments and the data systems and processes that will be impacted established a detailed implementation plan and developed a formal governance structure for the transition the company has developed and continues to implement various proactive steps to facilitate the transition on behalf of customers which include the adoption and ongoing implementation of fallback provisions that provide for the determination of replacement rates for liborlinked financial products the adoption of new products linked to alternative reference rates such as adjustablerate mortgages consistent with guidance provided by the us regulators the alternative reference rates committee and gses the selection of sofr indices as the replacement indices and successful completion of systems testing using the sofr replacement indices we intend to use the provisions of the adjustable interest rate libor act passed by congress and signed in to law by the president in march for certain contracts referencing libor the act provides for the use of sofr as the replacement index with a spread adjustment when the remaining libor indices are discontinued the act applies when there is no contract provision addressing the loss of libor and may be used otherwise as well provided the contract does not provide for a specific replacement index this aligns with the plan of action currently under implementation by the company the final rule implementing the act was released on december the company continues to evaluate its financial and operational infrastructure in its effort to transition all financial and strategic processes systems and models to reference rates other than libor the company is in the process of developing and implementing processes to educate clientfacing associates and coordinate communications with customers regarding the transition a townhall meeting with commercial relationship managers was held in advance of letters to commercial borrowers regarding libor retirement letters to consumer and mortgage borrowers were also mailed training and other resources for use by lenders and customer care representatives have been provided as of march the company had the following exposures to libor approximately billion of total outstanding loans referencing libor of this amount billion have maturities occurring after the libor discontinuation date of june approximately billion in interest rate swaps that are indexed to libor with a gross positive fair value of million inclusive of million of variation margin settlements and a gross negative fair value of million however the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements therefore the transition to libor will have no hedge accounting impact as changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings moreover the exposure of both sides of these swaps is presented in these figures these exposures are intended to offset each other trust preferred securities that reference libor and had a total principal balance of million these securities have maturities ranging from october through march deposit and loan concentrations we have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers we have no significant portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries furthermore we attempt to avoid making loans that in an aggregate amount exceed of total loans to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities as of march there were no aggregated loan concentrations of this type we do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us we do not have any foreign loans or deposits concentration of credit risk each category of earning assets has a certain degree of credit risk we use various techniques to measure credit risk credit risk in the investment portfolio can be measured through bond ratings published by independent agencies in the investment securities portfolio the investments consist of us governmentsponsored entity securities taxfree securities or other securities having ratings of aaa to not rated all securities with the exception of those that are not rated were rated by at least one of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations the credit risk of the loan portfolio can be measured by historical experience we maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with credit policies that we have established although the bank has a diversified loan portfolio a substantial portion of our borrowers abilities to honor their contracts is dependent upon economic conditions within our geographic footprint and the surrounding regions we consider concentrations of credit to exist when pursuant to regulatory guidelines the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents of total tier capital plus regulatory adjusted allowance for credit losses of the company or billion at march based on this criteria we had seven such credit concentrations at march including loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings except miniwarehouses of billion loans secured by owner occupied office buildings including medical office buildings of billion loans secured by owner occupied nonresidential buildings excluding office buildings of billion loans to lessors of residential buildings investment properties and multifamily of billion loans secured by 1st mortgage family owner occupied residential property including condos and home equity lines of billion loans secured by jumbo original loans greater than of billion and loans secured by business assets including accounts receivable inventory and equipment of billion the risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time the loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard acl methodology after the adoption of cecl in the first quarter of banking regulators established guidelines for calculating credit concentrations banking regulators set the guidelines for construction land development and other land loans to total less than of total tier capital less modified cecl transitional amount plus acl cdl concentration ratio and for total commercial real estate loans construction land development and other land loans along with other nonowner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans to total less than of total tier capital less modified cecl transitional amount plus acl cre concentration ratio both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the banks total tier capital less modified cecl transitional amount plus acl at march and december the banks cdl concentration ratio was and respectively and its cre concentration ratio was and respectively as of march the bank was below the established regulatory guidelines when a banks ratios are in excess of one or both of these loan concentration ratios guidelines banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management therefore we monitor these two ratios as part of our concentration management processes r econciliation of gaap to nongaap the return on average tangible equity is a nongaap
