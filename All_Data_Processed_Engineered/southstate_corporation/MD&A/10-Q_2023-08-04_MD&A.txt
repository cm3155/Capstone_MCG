of operations for the three and six months ended june compared to the three and six months ended june and also analyzes our financial condition as of june as compared to december like most financial institutions we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits on which we may pay interest consequently one of the key measures of our success is the amount of our net interest income or the difference between the income on our interestearning assets such as loans and investments and the expense on our interestbearing liabilities such as deposits another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interestearning assets and the rate we pay on our interestbearing liabilities of course there are risks inherent in all loans as such we maintain an allowance for credit losses otherwise referred to herein as acl to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible we establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for credit losses against our operating earnings in the following discussion we have included a detailed discussion of this process in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers we incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits we describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following discussion the following sections also identify significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial

recent events regulatory considerations in response to the recent bank failures the fdic approved a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement a special assessment to recover the losses to the fdics deposit insurance fund the fdic is proposing to collect the special assessment at an annual rate of approximately basis points over eight quarterly assessment periods beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of under the proposal the base for the special assessment will be equal to an insured depository institutions idis estimated uninsured deposits reported as of december adjusted to exclude the first billion under the current fdic proposal the company estimates the special assessment will equate to a quarterly special assessment of million or million for the twoyear special assessment period which would be recognized at the time the final rule is adopted the special assessment rate is subject to change prior to any final rule depending on any adjustments to the loss estimate mergers or failures or amendments to reported estimates of uninsured deposits liquidity and capital during the financial markets experienced some volatility in response to a small number of regional bank failures resulting from deposit runs generally related to high concentrations in particular customer segments high levels of uninsured deposits and failures in interest rate risk management deposit flows are significantly influenced by general and local economic conditions changes in prevailing interest rates internal pricing decisions and competition our deposits are primarily obtained from depositors located around our branch footprint and we believe that we have attractive opportunities to capture additional retail and commercial deposits in our markets in

and respectively at june the banks tier leverage ratio cet riskbased capital ratio and total riskbased capital ratio were and respectively at june as permitted we elected to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to available for sale securities from tier cet and total riskbased capital however even if our unrealized losses as of june in our available for sale and held to maturity investment portfolios were recognized by selling the portfolios for liquidity purposes all else being equal our regulatory capital ratios would remain well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the well capitalized regulatory classification critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in

policies in this quarterly report on form 10q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the acl on loans management considers forwardlooking information in estimating expected credit losses the company subscribes to a thirdparty service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the united states economy the baseline along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios is used by management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses management evaluates the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and takes into consideration the scenarios in relation to actual economic and other data such as gross domestic product growth monetary and fiscal policy inflation supply chain issues and global events like the russianukraine conflict as well as the volatility and magnitude of changes within those scenarios quarter over quarter and consideration of conditions within the banks operating environment and geographic area additional forecast scenarios may be weighted along with the baseline forecast to arrive at the final reserve estimate while periods of relative economic stability should generally lead to stability in forecast scenarios and weightings to estimate credit losses periods of instability can likewise require management to adjust the selection of scenarios and weightings in accordance with the accounting standards for the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period the company reverts to the long term mean of historical factors within four quarters using a straightline approach the company generally uses a fourquarter forecast and a fourquarter reversion period in spite of the rapid interest rate hikes experienced cycletodate the us has thus far avoided a recession although an inverted yield curve such as observed in the current interest rate environment often portends a coming recession management continues to use a blended forecast scenario of the baseline and more severe scenario depending on the circumstances and economic outlook for the quarter ending june management selected a baseline weighting of a weighting for an upside scenario and a weighting for the more severe scenario the scenario weightings were unchanged from the first quarter of the scenario weightings reflect continued recognition of downside risks in the economic forecast from persistent levels of inflation rising interest rates and tightening credit conditions conducive of a mild recession while employment figures still showed resilience and actual loan losses remain at low levels significant abrupt downward shifts in the forecasted commercial real estate price index elevated modeled expected losses for the commercial real estate and commercial construction and development which excludes residential construction loan segments the company determined that increases to expected loss rates for the completed commercial real estate portfolios were appropriate but the modeled expected loss rate for the commercial construction and development portfolio needed a

of our common stock and the availability of alternative investment opportunities we are subject to regulations with respect to certain riskbased capital ratios these riskbased capital ratios measure the relationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and offbalance sheet risks the values of both balance sheet and offbalance sheet items are adjusted based on the rules to reflect categorical credit risk in addition to the riskbased capital ratios the regulatory agencies have also established a leverage ratio for assessing capital adequacy the leverage ratio is equal to tier capital divided by total consolidated onbalance sheet assets minus amounts deducted from tier capital the leverage ratio does not involve assigning risk weights to assets specifically we are required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios a cet1 riskbased capital ratio of a tier riskbased capital ratio of a total riskbased capital ratio of and a leverage ratio of under the current capital rules tier capital includes two components cet1 capital and additional tier capital the highest form of capital cet1 capital consists solely of common stock plus related surplus retained earnings accumulated other comprehensive income otherwise referred to as aoci and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock additional tier capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and tier minority interests tier capital generally includes the allowance for loan losses up to of riskweighted assets qualifying preferred stock subordinated debt trust preferred securities and qualifying tier minority interests less any deductions in tier instruments of an unconsolidated financial institution aoci is presumptively included in cet1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital when the current capital rules were first implemented the bank exercised its onetime opportunity at the end of the first quarter of for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of aoci allowing us to retain our preexisting treatment for aoci in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives a banking organization must maintain a capital conservation buffer on top of its minimum riskbased capital requirements this buffer must consist solely of tier common equity but the buffer applies to all three riskbased measurements cet1 tier capital and total capital resulting in the following effective minimum capital plus capital conservation buffer ratios i a cet1 capital ratio of ii a tier riskbased capital ratio of and iii a total riskbased capital ratio of the bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action which identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized and is based on specified thresholds for each of the three riskbased regulatory capital ratios cet1 tier capital and total capital and for the leverage ratio the federal banking agencies revised their regulatory capital rules to i address the implementation of cecl ii provide an optional threeyear phasein period for the adoption date adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting cecl and iii require the use of cecl in stress tests beginning with the capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations that are subject to stress testing cecl became effective for us on january and the company applied the provisions of the standard using the modified retrospective method as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings related to the implementation of asu we recorded additional allowance for credit losses for loans of million deferred tax assets of million an additional reserve for unfunded commitments of million and an adjustment to retained earnings of million instead of recognizing the effects on regulatory capital from asu at adoption the company initially elected the option for recognizing the adoption date effects on the companys regulatory capital calculations over a threeyear phasein in response to the covid19 pandemic in the federal banking agencies issued a final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of cecl the company chose the fiveyear transition method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from the adoption date and the cecl difference for the first two years of application the modified cecl transitional amount was fixed as of december and that amount began the threeyear phase out in the first quarter of with being phased out in the wellcapitalized minimums and the companys and the banks regulatory capital ratios for the following periods are reflected below wellcapitalized june

unfunded commitments both regulatory riskbased assets and quarterly average assets remained reasonably flat compared to the fourth quarter with average assets for the company and bank increasing and riskbased assets increasing our capital ratios are currently well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the well capitalized regulatory classification should the company need to sell its available for sale and held to maturity securities for liquidity purposes and recognize the unrealized losses as of june through earnings all else equal our capital ratios would remain well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the well capitalized regulatory classification liquidity liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits extension of credit and payment of operating expenses liquidity risk is the risk that the banks financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by an inability or perceived inability to meet its obligations our asset liability management committee alco is charged with the responsibility of monitoring policies designed to ensure acceptable composition of our assetliability mix two critical areas of focus for alco are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management we have employed our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs asset liquidity is maintained by the maturity structure of loans investment securities and other shortterm investments management has policies and procedures governing the length of time to maturity on loans and investments normally changes in the earning asset mix are of a longerterm nature and are not used for daytoday corporate liquidity needs our liabilities provide liquidity on a daytoday basis daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased securities sold under agreements to repurchase interestbearing deposits at other banks and other shortterm borrowings we engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position these routine activities include various measures such as the following emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with our bank pricing deposits including certificates of deposit at rate levels that will attract and or retain balances of deposits that will enhance our banks assetliability management and net interest margin requirements and continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our banks appeal as a primary provider of financial services our nonacquired loan portfolio increased by approximately billion or approximately annualized compared to the balance at december the increase from december was mainly related to organic growth and renewals on acquired loans the acquired loan portfolio decreased by million from the balance at december through principal paydowns chargeoffs foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans our investment securities portfolio excluding trading securities decreased million compared to the balance at december the decrease in investment securities from december was a result of maturities calls sales and paydowns of investment securities totaling million as well as a reduction from the net amortization of premiums of million this decrease was partially offset by purchases of available for sale investment securities totaling million and fhlb stock of million as well as an increase in the market value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio of million there were no purchases of held to maturity securities during the quarter total cash and cash equivalents were billion at june as compared to billion at december this increase was due to the company increasing its brokered time deposits by billion and borrowing million in fhlb borrowings during to increase liquidity as customers moved funds from noninterest bearing checking interest bearing checking and savings accounts seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment and deposit insurance coverage at june and december we had billion and million of traditional outofmarket

this increase was driven by an increase in time deposits of billion including an increase in brokered time deposits of billion and an increase in money market accounts of billion these increases in deposits were partially offset by declines in noninterest bearing deposits of billion in interest bearing checking deposits of million and savings deposits of million as customers moved funds from noninterest bearing checking interest bearing checking and savings accounts seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment and deposit insurance coverage the companys balance in higher costing inmarket time deposits and brokered time deposits and in money market deposit accounts the company raised interest rates on most interestbearing deposit products in particular time deposit specials and money market accounts during the due to competitive pressures to retain deposits total corporate and subordinated debentures and other borrowings at june were million and consisted of trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures of million and fhlb borrowings of million the company borrowed billion during the and repaid billion in fhlb borrowings to increase liquidity the company reduced its period end fhlb borrowing by million during the second quarter of from million at march as the financial markets stabilized and the stress on liquidity declined total shortterm borrowings at june were million consisting of million in federal funds purchased and million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase to the extent that we employ other types of nondeposit funding sources typically to accommodate retail and correspondent customers we continue to take in shorter maturities of such funds our current approach may provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise through the operations of our bank we have made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of our business activities these commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to our customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time we manage the credit risk on these commitments by subjecting them to normal underwriting and risk management processes we believe that we have adequate sources of liquidity to fund commitments that are drawn upon by the borrowers in addition to commitments to extend credit we also issue standby letters of credit which are assurances to third parties that they will not suffer a loss if our customer fails to meet its contractual obligation to the thirdparty although our experience indicates that many of these standby letters of credit will expire unused through our various sources of liquidity we believe that we will have the resources to meet these obligations should the need arise our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets typically including some level of reverse repurchase agreements federal funds sold balances at the federal reserve bank andor other shortterm investments asset quality wellcapitalized position and profitable operating results cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our desired liquidity position at any time we expect that these conditions would generally be of a shortterm nature under such circumstances we expect our reverse repurchase agreements and federal funds sold positions or balances at the federal reserve bank if any to serve as the primary source of immediate liquidity we could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks the bank may also access funds from borrowing facilities established with the federal home loan bank of atlanta and the discount window of the federal reserve bank of atlanta the bank may also access funds through the federal reserve bank term funding program at june our bank had a total fhlb credit facility of billion with million in fhlb advances and million fhlb letters of credit outstanding at quarterend leaving billion in availability on the fhlb credit facility at june our bank had billion of credit available at the federal reserve banks discount window and federal funds credit lines of million with no balances outstanding at quarterend the bank also has an internal limit on brokered deposits of of total deposits which would allow capacity of billion at june the bank had billion of outstanding brokered deposits at the end of the quarter leaving billion in available capacity all of these resources would provide an additional billion in funding if we needed additional liquidity the bank also has billion in unpledged securities at june that can be pledge to attain additional funds if necessary we can also consider actions such as deposit promotions to increase core deposits the company has a million unsecured line of credit with us bank national association with no balance outstanding at june we believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available our contingency funding plan describes several potential stages based on stressed liquidity levels liquidity key risk indicators are reported to the board of directors on a quarterly basis we maintain various wholesale sources of funding if our deposit retention efforts were to be unsuccessful we would use these alternative sources of funding under such circumstances depending on the external source of funds our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates charged this could increase our cost of funds impacting our net interest margin and net interest spread assetliability management and market risk sensitivity our earnings and the economic value of equity vary in relation to the behavior of interest rates and the accompanying fluctuations in market prices of certain of our financial instruments we define interest rate risk as the risk to earnings and equity arising from the behavior of interest rates these behaviors include increases and decreases in interest rates as well as continuation of the current interest rate environment our interest rate risk principally consists of reprice option basis and yield curve risk reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing characteristics of asset and liability portfolios option risk arises from embedded options in the investment and loan portfolios such as investment securities calls and loan prepayment options option risk also exists since deposit customers may withdraw funds at their discretion in response to general market conditions competitive alternatives to existing accounts or other factors the exercise of such options may result in higher costs or lower revenue basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices which subsequently result in narrowing spreads on interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities basis risk also exists in administered rate liabilities such as interestbearing checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts where the price sensitivity of such products may vary relative to general markets rates yield curve risk refers to adverse consequences of nonparallel shifts in the yield curves of various market indices that impact our assets and liabilities we use simulation analysis as a primary method to assess earnings at risk and equity at risk due to assumed changes in interest rates management uses the results of its various simulation analyses in combination with other data and observations to formulate strategies designed to maintain interest rate risk within risk tolerances simulation analysis involves the use of several assumptions including but not limited to the timing of cash flows such as the terms of contractual agreements investment security calls loan prepayment speeds deposit attrition rates the interest rate sensitivity of loans and deposits relative to general market rates and the behavior of interest rates and spreads equity at risk simulation uses assumptions regarding discount rates that value cash flows simulation analysis is highly dependent on model assumptions that may vary from actual outcomes key simulation assumptions are subject to sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of assumption changes on earnings at risk and equity at risk model assumptions are reviewed by our assumptions committee earnings at risk is defined as the percentage change in net interest income due to assumed changes in interest rates earnings at risk is generally used to assess interest rate risk over relatively short time horizons equity at risk is defined as the percentage change in the net economic value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value the discounted present value of all cash flows represents our economic value of equity equity at risk is generally considered a measure of the longterm interest rate exposures of the balance sheet at a point in time the earnings simulation models take into account our contractual agreements with regard to investments loans deposits borrowings and derivatives as well as a number of behavioral assumptions applied to certain assets and liabilities mortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist of forward sales contracts and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans these derivatives involve underlying items such as interest rates and are designed to mitigate risk derivatives are also used to hedge mortgage servicing rights for additional information see note 28derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements from time to time we execute interest rate swaps to hedge some of our interest rate risks under these arrangements the company enters into a variable rate loan with a client in addition to a swap agreement the swap agreement effectively converts the clients variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan the company then enters into a matching swap agreement with a thirdparty dealer to offset its exposure on the customer swap the company may also execute interest rate swap agreements that are not specific to client loans as of june the company did not have such agreements for additional information on these derivatives refer to note 28derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements our interest rate risk key indicators are applied to a static balance sheet using forward rates from the moodys baseline scenario the company will also use other rate forecasts including but not limited to moodys consensus scenario this base case scenario assumes the maturity composition of asset and liability rollover volumes is modeled to approximately replicate current consolidated balance sheet characteristics throughout the simulation these treatments are consistent with the companys goal of assessing current interest rate risk embedded in its current balance sheet the base case scenario assumes that maturing or repricing assets and liabilities are replaced at prices referencing forward rates derived from the selected rate forecast consistent with current balance sheet pricing characteristics key rate drivers are used to price assets and liabilities with sensitivity assumptions used to price nonmaturity deposits the sensitivity assumptions for the pricing of nonmaturity deposits are subjected to sensitivity analysis no less frequently than on an annual basis interest rate shocks are applied to the base case on an instantaneous basis our policy establishes the use of upward and downward interest rate shocks applied in basis point increments through basis points we calculate smaller rate shocks as needed at times market conditions may result in assumed rate movements that will be deemphasized for example during a period of ultralow interest rates certain downward rate shocks may be impractical the model simulation results produced from the base case scenario and related instantaneous shocks for changes in net interest income and changes in the economic value of equity are referred to as the core scenario analysis and constitute the policy key risk indicators for interest rate risk when compared to risk tolerances during the second quarter of management revised its deposit beta assumptions higher due to the rapid increase in interest rates and expected further increases from the beginning of the upward rate cycle our deposit costs have increased from five basis points to one hundred twentyfive basis points during this period the federal funds rate has increased basis points accordingly our cycle to date beta has been approximately management recognizes the difficulty using historical data to forecast deposit betas in the current environment for internal purposes we are assuming a cumulative upward rate cycle beta of with a terminal federal funds rate of and a corresponding cumulative rate increase of basis points the following interest rate risk metrics are derived from analysis using the moodys consensus scenario published in july as the base case as of june the earnings simulations indicated that the year impact of an instantaneous basis point increase decrease in rates would result in an estimated increase up and decrease down in net interest income we use economic value of equity eve analysis as an indicator of the extent to which the present value of our capital could change given potential changes in interest rates this measure also assumes a static balance sheet base case scenario with rate shocks applied as described above at june the percentage change in eve due to a 100basis point increase or decrease in interest rates was decrease and decrease respectively the percentage changes in eve due to a 200basis point increase or decrease in interest rates were decrease and decrease respectively the interest rate shock analysis results for eve sensitivities are unusual as the benefits of repricing assets are mitigated by increasing deposit costs and downward shocks are constrained on various balance sheet categories due to the inability to price products below floors or zero this is particularly meaningful given the cost of deposits as of june the analysis below reflects a base case and shocked scenarios that assume a static balance sheet projection where volume is added to maintain balances consistent with current levels except for ppp loans that are not assumed to be replaced base case assumes new and repricing volumes reference forward rates derived from the moodys consensus rate forecast instantaneous parallel and sustained interest rate shocks are applied to the base case scenario over a oneyear time horizon percentage change in net interest income over one year up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points libor transition the publication of all tenors of us dollar libor on a representative basis ceased as of the june as previously noted we established a crossfunctional libor transition working group that assessed the companys exposure to libor indexed instruments and the data systems and processes that were impacted established a detailed implementation plan and developed a formal governance structure for the transition the company developed and implemented various proactive steps to facilitate the transition on behalf of customers up through june which included the adoption and implementation of fallback provisions that provided for the determination of replacement rates for liborlinked financial products the adoption of new products linked to alternative reference rates such as adjustablerate mortgages consistent with guidance provided by the us regulators the alternative reference rates committee and gses the selection of sofr indices as the replacement indices and successful completion of systems testing using the sofr replacement indices successful transition of liborexposed instruments to sofr and other indices as appropriate for contracts that provided for a specific replacement index other than sofr we utilized the provisions of the adjustable interest rate libor act passed by congress and signed into law by the president in march for certain contracts referencing libor the act provides for the use of sofr as the replacement index with a spread adjustment when the remaining libor indices are discontinued the act applies when there is no contract provision addressing the loss of libor and may be used otherwise as well provided the contract does not provide for a specific replacement index in addition the company developed and implemented processes to educate clientfacing associates and coordinate communications with customers regarding the transition as of june the companys liborindexed loans derivatives and trust preferred securities have migrated to sofr and other indices and will reprice by reference to such replacement indices at the next scheduled repricing date final validations and other verification tasks will be completed during the third quarter of deposit and loan concentrations we have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers we have no significant portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries furthermore we attempt to avoid making loans that in an aggregate amount exceed of total loans to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities as of june there were no aggregated loan concentrations of this type we do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us we do not have any foreign loans or deposits concentration of credit risk each category of earning assets has a certain degree of credit risk we use various techniques to measure credit risk credit risk in the investment portfolio can be measured through bond ratings published by independent agencies in the investment securities portfolio the investments consist of us governmentsponsored entity securities taxfree securities or other securities having ratings of aaa to not rated all securities with the exception of those that are not rated were rated by at least one of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations the credit risk of the loan portfolio can be measured by historical experience we maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with credit policies that we have established although the bank has a diversified loan portfolio a substantial portion of our borrowers abilities to honor their contracts is dependent upon economic conditions within our geographic footprint and the surrounding regions we consider concentrations of credit to exist when pursuant to regulatory guidelines the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents of total tier capital plus regulatory adjusted allowance for credit losses of the company or billion at june based on this criteria we had seven such credit concentrations at june including loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings except miniwarehouses of billion loans secured by owner occupied office buildings including medical office buildings of billion loans secured by owner occupied nonresidential buildings excluding office buildings of billion loans to lessors of residential buildings investment properties and multifamily of billion loans secured by 1st mortgage family owner occupied residential property including condos and home equity lines of billion loans secured by jumbo original loans greater than of billion and loans secured by business assets including accounts receivable inventory and equipment of billion the risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time the loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard acl methodology after the adoption of cecl in the first quarter of banking regulators established guidelines for calculating credit concentrations banking regulators set the guidelines for construction land development and other land loans to total less than of total tier capital less modified cecl transitional amount plus acl cdl concentration ratio and for total commercial real estate loans construction land development and other land loans along with other nonowner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans to total less than of total tier capital less modified cecl transitional amount plus acl cre concentration ratio both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the banks total tier capital less modified cecl transitional amount plus acl at june and december the banks cdl concentration ratio was and respectively and its cre concentration ratio was and respectively as of june the bank was below the established regulatory guidelines when a banks ratios are in excess of one or both of these loan concentration ratios guidelines banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management therefore we monitor these two ratios as part of our concentration management processes r econciliation of
