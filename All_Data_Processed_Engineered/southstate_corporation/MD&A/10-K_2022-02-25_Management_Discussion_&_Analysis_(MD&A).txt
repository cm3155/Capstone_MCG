mda describes southstate corporation and its subsidiarys results of operations for the year ended december as compared to the year ended december and the year ended december as compared to the year ended december and also analyzes our financial condition as of december as compared to december like most banking institutions we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits on most of which we pay interest consequently one of the key measures of our success is the amount of net interest income or the difference between the income on our interestearning assets such as loans and investments and the expense on our interest bearing liabilities such as deposits another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interestearning assets and the rate we pay on our interestbearing liabilities there are risks inherent in all loans so we maintain an allowance for credit losses to absorb our estimate of probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible we establish and maintain this allowance by recording a provision or recovery for credit losses against our earnings in the following section we have included a detailed discussion of this process in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers we incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits we describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following discussion the following section also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and

discussion of the companys results of operations for the year ended december as compared to the year ended december and the year ended december as compared to the year ended december see results of operations section of this mda starting on page at december we had total assets of approximately billion compared to approximately billion at december see the financial condition section of this mda starting on page for a more detailed description of the change in our balance sheet our asset quality results remained strong in for the year ended december net charge offs as a percentage of average loans remained unchanged at from the year ended december the total nonperforming assets npas decreased million to million at december from million at december acquired npas decreased million to million at december from million at december acquired nonperforming loans decreased million and acquired oreo and other nonperforming assets decreased million nonacquired npas decreased million to million at december from million at december this decline was mainly related to a decline in nonacquired nonperforming loans which fell by million from december nonacquired oreo and other npas remained stable in and decreased the total npas as a percentage of total assets decreased basis points to at december as compared to at december our efficiency ratio was at december compared to at december the positive change in our efficiency ratio was due to the effect of the increase in the total of net interest income and noninterest income being greater than the effect of the increase in noninterest expense the main reason for the increase in net interest income and noninterest income was due to the company having a full years effect of the income in from the merger with csfl that occurred in june the lower percentage increase in noninterest expense was mainly due to the cost saves recognized since the merger with csfl we continue to remain wellcapitalized with a total riskbased capital ratio of and a tier leverage ratio of as of december compared to and respectively at december the total risk based capital ratio decreased in as total riskweighted assets increased billion or while total riskbased capital excluding the change in accumulated other comprehensive income or aoci grew by million or the decrease in the total riskbased capital ratio at the company was due to the percentage increase in total riskbased capital being less than the percentage increase in total riskbased assets the reason for the lower percentage increase in the total riskbased capital at the company was due the redemption of million in subordinated debt and million in trust preferred securities during the second quarter of that was included in total riskedbased capital along with the amount of allowance for credit losses eligible for capital purposes declining million with the releases of provision in the tier leverage ratio decreased from the prior year as tier capital excluding the change in aoci increased by million or while total average eligible assets increased billion or the tier leverage ratio declined as the percentage increase in tier riskbased capital was less than the percentage increase in the average assets for regulatory capital purposes the increase in average assets was mainly due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments from december with deposits growing as the federal government has pushed funds into the market through stimulus programs in addition to consumers remaining conservative in their spending habits we believe our current capital ratios position us well to grow both organically and through certain strategic opportunities for further discussion of the companys financial condition as of december compared to december see financial condition section of this mda starting on page covid19 although the economy has been recovering from the covid19 pandemic and vaccine distributions and treatments are generally available businesses throughout the united states and our customers are still being adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic in many of the states in our market area as the economies have been allowed to reopen there has been an increase in cases of covid19 and several new variants of covid19 in that have caused cases to increase the impact of the covid19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve the covid19 pandemic and its associated impacts on trade including supply chains and export levels travel employee productivity unemployment consumer spending and other economic activities initially resulted in less economic activity lower equity market valuations and increased volatility and disruption in financial markets and had an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of general operations with a more limited impact to our correspondent banking and capital markets business lines those impacts declined as the economy reopened during the second half of however the ultimate extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition and results of operations is uncertain and will depend on various developments and other factors including among others an increase in cases as a result of new waves of the pandemic or as new variants of the disease begin to circulate how federal state and local governments and the private sector respond and the associated impacts on the economy financial markets and our customers employees and vendors our business financial condition and results of operations generally rely upon the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans the value of collateral underlying our secured loans and demand for loans and other products and services we offer which are highly dependent on the business environment in our primary markets where we operate and in the united states as a whole the covid19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our business and operations as part of our efforts to practice social distancing in march we closed all of our banking lobbies and began conducting most of our business through drivethru tellers and through electronic and online means to support the health and wellbeing of our employees we allowed a majority of our noncustomer facing workforce to work from home in october we reopened our banking lobbies in our branch locations but a majority of our support staff is still working from home we anticipate the remaining support staff that has elected to return to the office will return in early to support our customers or to comply with law starting in we deferred loan payments from to days for consumer and commercial customers we will continue to offer covid19 deferrals through september for customers directly impacted by the covid19 pandemic we suspended residential property foreclosure sales and involuntary automobile repossessions through october which was the latest moratorium expiration for states in our footprint eviction actions were suspended through december per centers for disease control and prevention agency order additionally we offered fee waivers payment deferrals and other expanded assistance for automobile mortgage small business and personal lending customers also we have extended credit to both customers and noncustomers related to the paycheck protection program ppp loans as of december we have produced approximately loans totaling approximately billion through the ppp approximately million of those ppp loans remain outstanding as of december the cfpb issued guidelines applicable to mortgage borrowers impacted by covid19 relating to loss mitigation and loan modifications which remain in effect from august until september we have confirmed that the companys current mortgage loan standards and processes meet all of the guidelines set forth by the cfpb future governmental actions may require more of these and other types of customerrelated responses as of december we have deferrals of million or of our total loan portfolio excluding loans held for sale and ppp loans for commercial loans the standard deferral was days for both principal and interest days of principal only payments or days of interest only payments we have actively reached out to our customers to provide guidance and direction on these deferrals in terms of available lines of credit the company has not experienced an increase in borrowers drawing down on their lines while deferrals have been decreasing materially since the third quarter of given the fluidity of the pandemic and the risk there may be new lockdowns or restrictions on business activities to slow the spread of the virus there is no guarantee that some loans not currently on deferral might return to deferral status a restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession in accordance with the cares act the company implemented loan modification programs in response to the covid19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms the companys payment relief assistance includes forbearance deferrals extension and reaging programs along with certain other modification strategies the company elected the accounting policy in the cares act to suspend tdr accounting to loans modified for borrowers impacted by the covid19 pandemic if the concession met the criteria defined under the cares act we are continuously monitoring the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our results of operations and financial condition with the adoption of asu on january the company changed its method for calculating its acl for loans investments unfunded commitments and other financial assets as a result of the new accounting standard the company changed its method for calculating its acl for loans from an incurred loss method to a life of loan method considering the covid19 pandemic in our cecl models and moving to one cecl model with the merged bank during the third quarter of we recorded a provision for credit losses of million in the recorded amount mainly was from the second quarter where the provision for credit losses was comprised of three major components million for the day provision for loans without significant credit deterioration nonpcd acquired from csfl million from the legacy southstate loan portfolio and million from the acquired csfl loan portfolio since the merger date while there have been improvements in the economic forecasts during resulting in a recovery for credit losses of million during the current year there is continued uncertainty around the covid19 pandemic and its latest omicron variant that may result in additional provision for credit losses in the future we also are monitoring the impact of covid19 on the valuation of goodwill additional detail in regards to the goodwill analysis is disclosed below under the goodwill and other intangible assets section of the critical accounting policies and estimates atlantic capital bancshares inc merger on july southstate and atlantic capital announced that the two companies had entered into a merger agreement which provides

warrants stock options and restricted stock units totaling million in the acquisition the company acquired billion of loans excluding loans held for sale at fair value net of million or estimated discount to the outstanding principal balance of the total loans acquired management identified billion with credit deficiencies that were identified as purchased credit deteriorated pcd loans the company assumed billion in deposits including a million premium for fixed maturity time deposits as a result of the bank merger the bank became a national banking association that is subject to primary supervision and regulation by the occ and subject to the national bank act and is no longer subject to supervision and regulation by the scbfi in addition the fdic is no longer the banks primary federal regulator and the bank is now a member of the federal reserve system branch consolidation and other cost initiatives as a part of the ongoing evaluation of customer service delivery and efficiencies the company consolidated branch locations in the first quarter of the annual savings in of these closures which primarily includes personnel facilities and equipment cost is expected to be and the impact in was approximately two of the locations were in florida and two in georgia capital management on january the board of directors of the company approved the authorization of a million share company stock repurchase plan the stock repurchase plan during the company repurchased a total of  for million or per share excluding commission expense critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and follow general practices within the banking industry our financial position and results of operations are affected by managements application of accounting policies including estimates assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses differences in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and related disclosures understanding our accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations accordingly our significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in note of our audited consolidated financial statements the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates assumptions and judgments business combinations we account for acquisitions under fasb asc topic business combinations which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting all identifiable assets acquired including loans and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value we adopted asu financial instruments credit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments on january which now requires us to record purchased financial assets with credit deterioration pcd assets defined as a morethaninsignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination or issuance at the purchase price plus the allowance for credit losses expected at the time of acquisition under this method there is no provision for credit losses affecting net income on acquisition of pcd assets changes in estimates of expected credit losses after acquisition are recognized as provision for credit loss expense or recovery of credit losses in subsequent periods as they arise any noncredit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets with credit deterioration shall be allocated to each individual asset at the acquisition date the initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis shall be allocated to individual assets to appropriately allocate any noncredit discount or premium the noncredit discount or premium after the adjustment for the allowance for credit losses shall be accreted into interest income using the interest method based on the effective interest rate determined after the adjustment for credit losses at the adoption date a purchased financial asset that does not qualify as a pcd asset is accounted for similar to an originated financial asset generally this means that an entity recognizes the allowance for credit losses for nonpcd assets through net income at the time of acquisition in addition both the credit discount and noncredit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets that do not qualify as pcd assets shall be allocated to each individual asset this combined discount or premium shall be accreted into interest income using the effective yield method for further discussion of our loan accounting and acquisitions see note 1summary of significant accounting policies note 2mergers and acquisitions note 4loans and note 5allowance for credit losses to the audited condensed consolidated financial statements allowance for credit losses or acl the acl reflects managements estimate of expected credit losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments due to the merger between the company and csfl effective june management collectively evaluated loans utilizing two different methodologies for the second quarter subsequently during the third quarter management adopted one methodology management used the one systematic methodology to determine its acl for loans held for investment and certain offbalancesheet credit exposures management considers the effects of past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio the companys estimate of its acl involves a high degree of judgment therefore managements process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses it is possible that others given the same information may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion the companys acl recorded in the balance sheet reflects managements best estimate within the range of expected credit losses the company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the acl for managements current estimate of expected credit losses see note summary of significant accounting policies for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the acl see also note 5allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses in this mda other real estate owned and bank property held for sale other real estate owned oreo consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans prior to the merger with csfl we classified former branch sites as oreo during the second quarter of and with the merger with csfl the company elected to reclassify these assets as bank property held for sale and report on a separate line within the consolidated balance sheet both oreo and bank property held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and the fair value was determined on the basis of current valuations obtained principally from independent sources adjusted for estimated selling costs at the time of foreclosure or initial possession of collateral for oreo any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the acl at the time a bank property is no longer in service and is moved to held for sale any excess of the current book value over fair value is recorded as noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income subsequent adjustments to this value are described below in the following paragraph we report subsequent declines in the fair value of oreo and bank properties held for sale below the new cost basis through valuation adjustments significant judgment and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of these properties and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility in response to market conditions and other economic factors management may utilize liquidation sales as part of its problem asset disposition strategy as a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from the current valuations used to determine the fair value of these properties management reviews the value of these properties periodically and adjusts the values as appropriate revenue and expenses from oreo operations as well as gains or losses on sales and any subsequent adjustments to the value are recorded as oreo expense in the consolidated statements of income gains or losses on sale of bank properties held for sale and generally any subsequent writedowns to the value are recorded as a component in other expense in the consolidated statements of income goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed in a business combination as of december and the balance of goodwill was billion goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets fair value in january the fasb issued asu no which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment for all entities by requiring impairment charges to be based on step of the previous accounting guidances twostep impairment test under asc topic under the new guidance if a reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value an entity will record an impairment charge based on that difference the impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit the new standard eliminates the requirement to calculate a goodwill impairment charge using step which involved calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment the standard does not change the guidance on completing step of the goodwill impairment test an entity will still be able to perform todays optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment before proceeding to the quantitative step of determining whether the reporting units carrying amount exceeds it fair value this guidance was effective for the company as of january during the second quarter of the company changed its annual goodwill valuation date to october each year in order for the valuation to be closer to our yearend audit date we evaluated the carrying value of goodwill as of october our annual test date considering the effects of covid19 and determined that no impairment charge was necessary our stock price has historically traded above its book value however during the first quarter of our stock price fell below book value and remained below book value until november this drop in stock price was mainly in reaction to the covid19 pandemic which effected stock prices of companies in almost all industries the lowest trading price for our stock during was which was below yearend book value of on december our stock price closed at which is above the book value of and tangible book value of based upon our internal valuation and analysis as of october we determined that no impairment charge was necessary at this time we will continue to monitor the impact of covid19 on the companys business operating results cash flows and financial condition if the covid19 pandemic continues and the economy continues to deteriorate and our stock price falls below current levels we will have to reevaluate the impact on our financial condition and potential impairment of goodwill core deposit intangibles and client list intangibles consist primarily of amortizing assets established during the acquisition of other banks this includes whole bank acquisitions and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities from other financial institutions core deposit intangibles represent the estimated value of longterm deposit relationships acquired in these transactions client list intangibles represent the value of longterm client relationships for the correspondent banking and wealth and trust management business these costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives such as deposit accounts in the case of core deposit intangible on a method that we believe reasonably approximates the anticipated benefit stream from this intangible the estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness income taxes and deferred tax assets income taxes are provided for the tax effects of the transactions reported in our consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related to differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of certain assets and liabilities including loans available for sale securities acl write downs of oreo properties and bank properties held for sale accumulated depreciation net operating loss carry forwards accretion income deferred compensation intangible assets mortgage servicing rights and postretirement benefits the deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled a valuation allowance is recorded in situations where it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset is not realizable as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return additionally income tax returns are filed by the company or its subsidiaries in the states of alabama california colorado florida georgia mississippi north carolina south carolina tennessee texas new york and virginia and city of new york city we evaluate the need for income tax reserves related to uncertain income tax positions but had no material reserves at december or recent accounting standards and pronouncements for information relating to recent accounting standards and pronouncements see note to our audited consolidated financial statements entitled summary of significant accounting policies results of operations consolidated net income available to common shareholders increased by million for the year ended december compared to the year ended december this increase reflects a decrease in provision for credit losses an increase in interest income a decrease in interest expense and an increase in noninterest income partially offsetting these positive effects on net income was an increase in noninterest expense and an increase in the provision for income taxes the increase in net income was due to the effects from the merger with csfl in with the company having a full year of net interest income and noninterest income from the merger in along with the company having a lower amount of merger related expenses in another significant impact was related to the releases in the allowance for credit losses in compared to provision for credit losses in below are key highlights of our results of operations during table start consolidated net income available to common shareholders increased to million in compared to million in and increased million or from million compared to table end table start o decreased provision for credit losses of million as the company recorded a release of the allowance for credit losses of million in while in the company recorded the provision for credit losses of million which included an initial day provision of million on nonpcd loans and unfunded commitments acquired from csfl ie the impact of the adoption of cecl on nonpcd acquired loans and million in provision for credit losses on loans this provision for credit losses table end table start was the result of forecasted

stabilization in the economy the company released some of the allowance for credit losses based on improvements in economic forecasts table endtable start o increased interest income of million resulting from a million increase in interest income from loans and loans held for sale a million increase in interest income from investment securities and a million increase in interest income on federal funds sold securities purchased under agreement to resell and interestbearing deposits table end table start the increase in interest income on loans resulted from a higher nonacquired loan interest income of million due to an increase in average balances through organic loan growth and the renewal of acquired loans that are moved to our nonacquired loan portfolio the increase in interest income due higher average balance was partially offset by a basis point decline in the yield table end table start interest income on acquired loans increased million due to a higher average balance from the loans acquired in the merger with csfl in june with having a full years effect of the acquired loans this was partially offset by a basis point decline in the yield on the acquired loan portfolio table endtable start the increase in interest income from investment securities was due to an increase in the average balance in as the company strategically invested its excess funds from continued deposit growth which was partially offset by a decline in the yield of basis points resulting from the ongoing lower interest rate environment table endtable start o decreased interest expense of million due to a basis point decrease in the cost of total interestbearing liabilities the decrease in cost of interestbearing liabilities was due to the continued low interest rate environment along with the reduction in the average balance of higher costing corporate and subordinated debentures and other borrowings table endtable start o increased noninterest income of million was primarily from a million increase in correspondent banking and capital markets income a million increase in fees on deposit accounts a million increase in trust and investment services income and a million increase in bank owned life insurance boli income these increases were partially offset by a million decline in mortgage banking income see noninterest income section on page for further discussion table endtable start o increased noninterest expense of million was primarily from a million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense a million increase in occupancy expense a million increase in information services expense in addition with the redemption of the million trust preferred securities the remaining fair value mark of million was written off as an extinguishment of debt cost during the second quarter of these increases were partially offset by a million swap termination expense that occurred in the fourth quarter of along with an million decrease in merger and branch consolidation related expense see noninterest expense section on page for further discussion and table endtable start o higher income tax provision of million due to higher pretax book income in compared to along with the recognition of a onetime benefit of million recorded in the fourth quarter related to the ability to carryback tax losses under the cares act the company recorded pretax book income of million in compared to pretax income of million in table endtable start basic earnings per common share increased to in from in and increased from in table endtable start diluted earnings per common share increased to in from in and increased from in table endtable start return on average assets was in compared to in and to in the increase in compared to was driven by the growth in net income of or million to million being greater than the increase in total average assets of or billion to billion in as mentioned previously the growth in net income as well as the increase in average assets was mainly related to the full year impact from the merger with csfl in the second quarter of the increase in net income was also due to the reversals of provision for credit losses in as economic forecasts improved table end table start related to the covid19 pandemic the decrease in compared to was driven by the increase in total average assets of or billion to

above the increase in net income was mainly due to a full years impact from the merger with csfl along with the reversals of provision for credit losses in related to improved economic forecasts related to the covid19 pandemic the decrease in compared to was driven by both an increase in average common shareholders equity of or billion and a decline in net income of or million in the increase in average equity was due to the equity issued in the merger with csfl in the second quarter of and the decline in net income was mainly due to the day provision for credit losses and expenses related to the merger with csfl table end table start our dividend payout ratio was for compared with in and in the decrease in the dividend payout ratio in compared to was due to the growth in net income available to common shareholders which increased being greater than the increase in dividends paid of or million the increase in net income in was mainly due to lower net income in attributable to the day provision for credit losses from the csfl merger higher provision for credit losses due the covid19 pandemic and expenses related to the merger with csfl the increase in the dividends paid was due to the increase in average outstanding shares from the merger with csfl for a full year in addition to the company increasing the cash dividend per share from to starting in the third quarter of the increase in the dividend payout ratio in compared to was due to the increase in dividends paid of or million as well as the decline in net income available to common shareholders which decreased the increase in the dividends paid was due the increase in outstanding shares from the merger with csfl and the decline in net income was mainly due to the day provision for credit losses and expenses related to the merger with csfl table end net interest income net interest income is the largest component of our net income net interest income is the difference between income earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings net interest income is determined by the yields earned on interestearning assets rates paid on interestbearing liabilities the relative balances of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the degree of mismatch and the maturity and repricing characteristics of interestearning assets and interest bearing liabilities net interest income divided by average interestearning assets represents our net interest margin during the federal reserves federal open market committees target for federal funds target rate remained at the to range until july when the federal reserve began to drop the federal funds target rate in the last half of the federal reserve dropped the federal funds target rate basis points to the range of to at december the federal reserve then dropped the federal funds target rate basis points to a range of to in march in reaction to the covid19 pandemic this drop in interest rates in and continued to affect both our net interest income and net interest margin for the year ended the yield on interestearning assets declined basis points in compared to and by basis points in compared to the yield on our acquired loan portfolio decreased basis points in from after a decrease of basis point in from and the yield on our nonacquired loan portfolio decreased of basis points in from after a decrease of basis points in from these declines in yields on earning assets were the main drivers in the net interest margin declining basis points in compared to and basis points in compared to we have also continued focusing on increasing core deposits excluding certificates of deposits and other time deposits the core deposits grew primarily due to the federal government pushing funds into the market

securities in the consolidated financial statements for additional information the increase in the number of securities in a loss position and the relative percentage of loss to portfolio size was primarily a result of the increase in short and longterm interest rates during management evaluates securities for impairment where there has been a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of a security to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with the decline in fair value on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation credit losses are calculated individually rather than collectively using a discounted cash flow method whereby management compares the present value of expected cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the security the credit loss component would be recognized through the provision for credit losses consideration is given to the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer including looking at default and delinquency rates the outlook for receiving the contractual cash flows of the investments the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value or for a debt security whether it is morelikelythannot that we will be required to sell the debt security prior to recovering its fair value the anticipated outlook for changes in the general level of interest rates credit ratings thirdparty guarantees and collateral values in analyzing an issuers financial condition management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred the results of reviews of the issuers financial condition and the issuers anticipated ability to pay the contractual cash flows of the investments the

fannie mae fhlb ffcb and sba all of the us treasury and agencybacked securities have the full faith and credit backing of the united states government or one of its agencies municipal securities and all other securities that do not have a zero expected credit loss are evaluated quarterly to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with a decline in fair value all debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of december continue to perform as scheduled and we do not believe there is a credit loss or a provision for credit losses is necessary also as part of our evaluation of our intent and ability to hold investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market we consider our investment strategy cash flow needs liquidity position

portfolio the yield on the nonacquired loan portfolio decreased from in to in and the yield on the acquired loan portfolio declined from in to in the decline in the yields on the nonacquired loan

contractual term of a loan when determining the contractual term the company considers expected prepayments but is precluded from considering expected extensions renewals or modifications unless the company reasonably expects it will execute a tdr with a borrower in the event of a reasonablyexpected tdr the company factors the reasonablyexpected tdr into the current expected credit losses estimate for consumer loans the point at which a tdr is reasonably expected is when the company approves the borrowers application for a modification ie the borrower qualifies for the tdr or when the credit administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans for commercial loans the point at which a tdr is reasonably expected is when the company approves the loan for modification or when the credit administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans the company uses a discounted cash flow methodology for a tdr to calculate the effect of the concession provided to the borrower within the acl a restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession in accordance with the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act also known as the cares act the company implemented loan modification programs in response to the covid19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with

december all potential problem loans represent those loans where information about possible credit problems of the borrowers has caused management to have concern about the borrowers ability to comply with present repayment terms allowance for credit losses acl as stated previously the acl reflects managements estimate of expected credit losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments at adoption of asu the company established the incremental increase in the acl through equity and subsequent adjustments through a provision for or recovery of credit losses recorded to earnings the company records loans charged off against the acl and subsequent recoveries if any increase the acl when they are recognized management uses systematic methodologies to determine its acl for loans held for investment and certain offbalancesheet credit exposures the acl is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loan portfolio management considers the effects of past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio the companys estimate of its acl involves a high degree of judgment therefore managements process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses the companys acl recorded in the balance sheet reflects managements best estimate within the range of expected credit losses the company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the acl for managements current estimate of expected credit losses the companys acl is calculated using collectively evaluated and individually evaluated loans the company merged with csfl on june for the second quarter ended june given the proximity of the merger date to the quarter end management collectively evaluated loans from each legacy loan portfolio utilizing preexisting methodologies implemented prior to the merger and aggregated the result during the third quarter of management consolidated the two methodologies into one to arrive at the acl recorded at september for both the acl related to the loan portfolio and the reserve related to the unfunded commitments offbalancesheet credit exposures the new methodology for unfunded commitments utilizes a funding rate as opposed to a utilization rate which was a method applied to the southstate legacy portfolio prior to the third quarter to determine the reserve for each respective segment of unfunded commitments this new method along with the change in mix of unfunded commitments resulted in an increase in the reserve for legacy southstate bank unfunded commitments during the third quarter of the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist loans with similar risk characteristics are grouped into homogenous segments or pools for analysis the discounted cash flow dcf method is utilized for each loan in a pool and the results are aggregated at the pool level a periodic tendency to default and absolute loss given default are applied to a projective model of the loans cash flow while considering prepayment and principal curtailment effects the analysis produces expected cash flows for each instrument in the pool by pairing loanlevel term information eg maturity date payment amount interest rate etc with topdown pool assumptions eg default rates and prepayment speeds the company has identified the following portfolio segments owneroccupied commercial real estate non owneroccupied commercial real estate multifamily municipal commercial and industrial commercial construction and land development residential construction residential senior mortgage residential junior mortgage revolving mortgage and consumer and other in determining the proper level of the acl management has determined that the loss experience of the bank provides the best basis for its assessment of expected credit losses it therefore utilized its own historical credit loss experience by each loan segment over an economic cycle while excluding loss experience from certain acquired institutions ie failed banks for most of the segment models for collectively evaluated loans the company incorporated two or more macroeconomic drivers using a statistical regression modeling methodology management considers forwardlooking information in estimating expected credit losses the company subscribes to a thirdparty service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the united states economy the baseline along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios is used by management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses management has evaluated the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and has made adjustments as needed management evaluates the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and takes into consideration the scenarios in relation to actual economic and other data such as covid19 epidemiological data and federal stimulus as well as the volatility and magnitude of changes within those scenarios quarter over quarter and consideration of condition within the banks operating environment and geographic area additional forecast scenarios may be weighed along with the baseline forecast to arrive at the final reserve estimate while periods of relative economic stability should generally lead to stability in forecast scenarios and weightings to estimate credit losses periods of instability can likewise require management to adjust the selection of scenarios and weightings in accordance with the accounting standards for the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period the company reverts to the long term mean of historical factors within four quarters using a straightline approach the company generally utilizes a fourquarter forecast and a fourquarter reversion period the covid19 pandemic has created increased volatility and uncertainties within the economy and economic forecasts accordingly management has used a blended forecast scenario of the baseline and more severe scenario ranging between twothirds baseline and onethird more severe scenario to an equal weight between the baseline and more severe scenario since december depending on the circumstances and economic outlook as of december management selected a baseline weighting of down from in the third quarter of and increased the more severe scenario to as several issues have materialized that warrant a more cautious approach these issues include but are not limited to level of optimism in the baseline forecast outlook as compared to consensus forecasts political impediments to moving the build back america legislation forward persistent headwinds related to the omicron variant of covid19 and growing evidence that inflationary pressures in the labor market and supply chains are more than transitory the resulting release was approximately million during the fourth quarter of if the economic forecast weighting had not been adjusted from the third quarter of this would have resulted in a higher release of approximately million which management deemed inappropriate given the underlying economic conditions and likelihood of additional stimulus as compared with assumptions in the baseline scenario included in its systematic methodology to determine its acl management considers the need to qualitatively adjust expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process these qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation ie formulaic model results each period the company considers qualitative factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework that includes the following lending policy economic conditions not captured in models volume and mix of loan portfolio past due trends concentration risk external factors and model limitations when a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with its segment the asset is assessed to determine whether it should be included in another pool or should be individually evaluated the companys threshold for individuallyevaluated loans includes all nonaccrual loans with a net book balance in excess of million management will monitor the credit environment and make adjustments to this threshold in the future if warranted based on the threshold above consumer financial assets will generally remain in pools unless they meet the dollar threshold the expected credit losses on individuallyevaluated loans will be estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis unless the loan meets the criteria for use of the fair value of collateral either by virtue of an expected foreclosure or through meeting the definition of collateraldependent financial assets that have been individually evaluated can be returned to a pool for purposes of estimating the expected credit loss insofar as their credit profile improves and that the repayment terms were not considered to be unique to the asset management measures expected credit losses over the contractual term of a loan when determining the contractual term the company considers expected prepayments but is precluded from considering expected extensions renewals or modifications unless the company reasonably expects it will execute a troubled debt restructuring tdr with a borrower in the event of a reasonablyexpected tdr the company factors the reasonablyexpected tdr into the current expected credit losses estimate for consumer loans the point at which a tdr is reasonably expected is when the company approves the borrowers application for a modification ie the borrower qualifies for the tdr or when the credit administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans for commercial loans the point at which a tdr is reasonably expected is when the company approves the loan for modification or when the credit administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans the company uses a discounted cash flow methodology for a tdr to calculate the effect of the concession provided to the borrower within the acl a restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession in accordance with the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act also known as the cares act the company implemented loan modification programs in response to the covid19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to

creditdeteriorated otherwise referred to herein as pcd assets are defined as acquired individual financial assets or acquired groups of financial assets with similar risk characteristics that as of the date of acquisition have experienced a morethaninsignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination as determined by the companys assessment the company records acquired pcd loans by adding the expected credit losses ie allowance for credit losses to the purchase price of the financial assets rather than recording through the provision for credit losses in the income statement the expected credit loss as of the acquisition day of a pcd loan is added to the allowance for credit losses the noncredit discount or premium is the difference between the unpaid principal balance and the amortized cost basis as of the acquisition date subsequent to the acquisition date the change in the acl on pcd loans is recognized through the provision for credit losses the noncredit discount or premium is accreted or amortized respectively into interest income over the remaining life of the pcd loan on a levelyield basis in accordance with the transition requirements within the standard the companys acquired creditimpaired loans ie aci or purchased credit impaired were treated as pcd loans the company follows its nonaccrual policy by reversing contractual interest income in the income statement when the company places a loan on nonaccrual status therefore management excludes the accrued interest receivable balance from the amortized cost basis in measuring expected credit losses on the portfolio and does not record an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable as of december and the accrued interest receivable for loans recorded in other assets were million and million respectively the company has a variety of assets that have a component that qualifies as an offbalance sheet exposure these primarily include undrawn portions of revolving lines of credit and standby letters of credit the expected losses associated with these exposures within the unfunded portion of the expected credit loss will be recorded as a liability on the balance sheet management has determined that a majority of the companys offbalancesheet credit exposures are not unconditionally cancellable management completes funding studies based on historical data to estimate the percentage of unfunded loan commitments that will ultimately be funded to calculate the reserve for unfunded commitments management applies this funding rate along with the loss factor rate determined for each pooled loan segment to unfunded loan commitments excluding unconditionally cancellable exposures and letters of credit to arrive at the reserve for unfunded loan commitments as of december and the liabilities recorded for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments were million and million respectively the current adjustment to the acl for unfunded commitments is recognized through the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income the company did not have an allowance for credit losses or record a provision for credit losses on investment securities or other financials asset during with the adoption of asu on january the company changed its method for calculating the allowance for loans from an incurred loss method to a life of loan method see note 1significant accounting policies as of december the balance of the acl was million or of total loans the acl decreased million from the balance of million recorded at september this decrease during the fourth quarter of included an million release or decline in the provision for credit losses in addition to million in net chargeoffs for the year ended december the acl decreased million from the balance of million the decrease in acl of million was due to a release of the allowance for credit losses of million along with net chargeoffs of million in for both the three and

requirements have been met primarily through retained earnings less the payment of cash dividends as of december shareholders equity was billion an increase of million or compared to the balance at december the change from yearend was mainly attributable to net income of million less dividends paid on common shares of million common stock repurchased under our stock repurchase plan of million and a decline in the aoci attributable to a decrease in the market value of securities available for sale of million the following shows the changes in shareholders equity during table 25changes in

compensation common stock repurchased pursuant to stock repurchase plan common stock repurchased equity plans total shareholders equity at december table end our equitytoassets ratio decreased to at december from at december the decrease from december was due to the percentage increase in equity of being less than the percentage increase in total assets of the increase in assets was mainly due to the increase in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities as deposits grew providing the bank with excess liquidity during the lower percentage growth in capital was mainly due to the company repurchasing million in common stock through its stock repurchase plan and paying dividends on common shares of million in on january our board of directors approved a program repurchase program to repurchase up to of our common stock in june our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional  of our common stock under the companys repurchase program after considering among other things our liquidity needs and capital resources as well as the estimated current value of our net assets in the company repurchased a total of  for million or per share excluding commission expense of which  were from the repurchase program and the remaining  were from the revised repurchase program the company repurchased an additional  for million or per share excluding commission expense in under the repurchase program for a total of repurchased under the authorized on january the board of directors of the company approved the authorization of a new million share company stock repurchase plan which replaced in its entirety the repurchase program as of december we repurchased  at an average price of per share excluding cost of commissions for a total of million under the stock repurchase plan and may repurchase up to an additional  of common stock under the program the number of shares to be purchased and the timing of the purchases during and were based on a variety of factors including but not limited to the level of cash balances general business conditions regulatory requirements the market price of our common stock and the availability of alternative investment opportunities we are subject to regulations with respect to certain riskbased capital ratios these riskbased capital ratios measure the relationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and offbalance sheet risks the values of both balance sheet and offbalance sheet items are adjusted based on the rules to reflect categorical credit risk in addition to the riskbased capital ratios the regulatory agencies have also established a leverage ratio for assessing capital adequacy the leverage ratio is equal to tier capital divided by total consolidated onbalance sheet assets minus amounts deducted from tier capital the leverage ratio does not involve assigning risk weights to assets specifically we are required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios table start a cet1 riskbased capital ratio of table endtable start a tier riskbased capital ratio of table endtable start a total riskbased capital ratio of and table endtable start a leverage ratio of table end under the current capital rules tier capital includes two components cet1 capital and additional tier capital the highest form of capital cet1 capital consists solely of common stock plus related surplus retained earnings accumulated other comprehensive income otherwise referred to as aoci and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock additional tier capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock tier minority interests and grandfathered trust preferred securities as discussed below tier capital generally includes the allowance for loan losses up to of riskweighted assets qualifying preferred stock subordinated debt and qualifying tier minority interests less any deductions in tier instruments of an unconsolidated financial institution cumulative perpetual preferred stock is included only in tier capital except that the capital rules permit bank holding companies with less than billion in total consolidated assets to continue to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before may in tier capital but not in cet1 capital subject to certain restrictions with the merger with csfl during the second quarter of the companys trust preferred securities no longer qualifies for tier capital and is now only included in tier capital for regulatory capital calculations aoci is presumptively included in cet1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital when the current capital rules were first implemented the bank exercised its onetime opportunity at the end of the first quarter of for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of aoci allowing us to retain our preexisting treatment for aoci in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives a banking organization must maintain a capital conservation buffer on top of its minimum riskbased capital requirements this buffer must consist solely of tier common equity but the buffer applies to all three riskbased measurements cet1 tier capital and total capital resulting in the following effective minimum capital plus capital conservation buffer ratios i a cet1 capital ratio of ii a tier riskbased capital ratio of and iii a total riskbased capital ratio of the bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action which identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized and is based on specified thresholds for each of the three riskbased regulatory capital ratios cet1 tier capital and total capital and for the leverage ratio the federal banking agencies revised their regulatory capital rules to i address the implementation of cecl ii provide an optional threeyear phasein period for the adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting cecl and iii require the use of cecl in stress tests beginning with the capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations that are subject to stress testing cecl became effective for us on january and the company applied the provisions of the standard using the modified retrospective method as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings related to the implementation of asu we recorded additional allowance for credit losses for loans of million deferred tax assets of million an additional reserve for unfunded commitments of million and an adjustment to retained earnings of million instead of recognizing the effects on regulatory capital from asu at adoption the company initially elected the option for recognizing the adoption date effects on the companys regulatory capital calculations over a threeyear phasein in in response to the covid19 pandemic the federal banking agencies issued a final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of cecl the final rule provides banking organizations that adopt cecl in the calendar year with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital followed by the aforementioned threeyear transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of benefit during the initial twoyear delay for a total fiveyear transition the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital modified cecl transitional amount is calculated as the sum of the impact on retained earnings upon adoption of cecl cecl transitional amount and the calculated change in the acl relative to the acl upon adoption of cecl multiplied by a scaling factor of the scaling factor is used to approximate the difference in the acl under cecl relative to the incurred loss methodology the modified cecl transitional amount will be calculated each quarter for the first two years of the fiveyear transition the amount of the modified cecl transition amount will be fixed as of december and that amount will be subject to the threeyear phaseout the company chose the fiveyear transition method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from the adoption date and the change in the acl relative to the acl on adoption date for the first two years of application table 26capital adequacy ratios the following table presents our consolidated capital ratios under the applicable capital rules table start december in percent common equity tier riskbased capital tier riskbased capital total riskbased capital tier leverage table end the tier leverage ratio and the total riskbased capital ratio both decreased compared to the ratios at december the common equity tier riskbased capital ratio and the tier riskbased capital ratio both stayed relatively flat in as they only declined basis points the tier leverage ratio decreased from as tier capital excluding the change in aoci increased by million or while total average eligible assets increased billion or the tier leverage ratio declined as the percentage increase in tier riskbased capital was less than the percentage increase in the average assets for regulatory capital purposes the increase in average assets was mainly due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments from december with deposits growing as the federal government has pushed funds into the market through stimulus programs in addition to consumers remaining conservative in their spending habits the lower percentage increase in tier riskbased capital was mainly due to the company repurchasing common shares for million through its stock repurchase plan in the total risk based capital ratio decreased in as total riskweighted assets increased billion or while total riskbased capital excluding the change in accumulated other comprehensive income or aoci grew by million or the decrease in the total riskbased capital ratio at the company was due to the percentage increase in total riskbased capital being less than the percentage increase in total riskbased assets the reason for the lower percentage increase in the total riskbased capital at the company was due the redemption of million in subordinated debt and million in trust preferred securities during the second quarter of that was included in total riskedbased capital along with the amount of allowance for credit losses eligible for capital purposes declining million with the releases of provision in the lower percentage increase in tier riskbased capital was also due to the company repurchasing common shares for million through its stock repurchase plan in the common equity tier riskbased capital ratio and the tier riskbased capital ratio both stayed relatively flat in as they only declined basis points as the percentage change in tier riskbased capital and the percentage change in total riskbased asset were approximately the same in compared to our capital ratios are currently well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the well capitalized regulatory classification the company pays cash dividends to shareholders from its assets which are mainly provided by dividends from its banking subsidiary however certain restrictions exist regarding the ability of its subsidiary to transfer funds to the company in the form of cash dividends loans or advances the approval of the occ is required if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus the federal banking agencies have issued policy statements which provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current earnings during the bank paid dividends to southstate totaling million the bank was not required to get approval of the occ to pay these dividends we used these funds and excess cash to pay our dividend to shareholders of million repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market totaling million and redeem million in trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures during first quarter of the bank paid special dividends to the company totaling million for which scbfi approval was not required these funds were used to repurchase company stock on the open market totaling million during the first quarter of the bank also paid a special dividend of million during the first quarter of to provide the company with more general operating liquidity during the covid19 pandemic during the bank paid special dividends to the company totaling million for which scbfi approval was required the bank received approval from the scbfi in june to pay an additional million above current year net income in dividends to the company these funds were used to repurchase company stock on the open market totaling million during the following table provides the amount of dividends and payout ratios for the years ended december table 27dividends paid to common shareholders table start year ended december  in thousands dividend payments to common shareholders dividend payout ratios table end we retain earnings to have capital sufficient to grow our loan and investment portfolios and to support certain acquisitions or other business expansion opportunities the dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends paid during the year by net income for the year liquidity liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits extension of credit and payment of operating expenses liquidity risk is the risk that the banks financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by an inability or perceived inability to meet its obligations our asset liability management committee alco is charged with the responsibility of monitoring policies that are designed to ensure acceptable composition of our assetliability mix two critical areas of focus for alco are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management we have employed our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs asset liquidity is maintained by the maturity structure of loans investment securities and other short term investments management has policies and procedures governing the length of time to maturity on loans and investments as reported in table less than one percent of the investment portfolio contractually matures in one year or less this segment of the portfolio consists mostly of municipal obligations along with some paydowns of mortgagebacked securities there is also an additional amount of securities that could be called or prepaid as well as expected monthly paydowns of mortgage backed securities normally changes in the earning asset mix are of a longer term nature and are not utilized for day to day corporate liquidity needs our liabilities provide liquidity on a day to day basis daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased securities sold under agreements to repurchase interestbearing deposits at other banks and other short term borrowings we engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position these routine activities include various measures such as the following table start emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with our bank table endtable start pricing deposits including certificates of deposit at rate levels that will attract and or retain balances of deposits that will enhance our banks assetliability management and net interest margin requirements and table endtable start continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our banks appeal as a primary provider of financial services table end our nonacquired loan portfolio increased by approximately billion or approximately compared to the balance at december the nonacquired loan balance includes million ppp loans outstanding at december excluding ppp loans the nonacquired loan portfolio increased by billion or from december the increase in the nonacquired loan portfolio was due to organic growth and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our nonacquired loan portfolio the acquired loan portfolio decreased by billion or from the balance at december this decrease was through principal paydowns chargeoffs foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans that moved into our nonacquired loan portfolio our investment securities portfolio increased billion or compared to the balance at december the increase in investment securities from december was a result of the company strategically investing its excess funds from continued deposit growth during we purchased billion of securities million classified as held to maturity and billion classified as available for sale these increases were partially offset by maturities calls sales and paydowns of investment securities totaling billion n et amortization of premiums were million in total cash and cash equivalents were billion at december compared to billion at december the growth in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities was driven by the billion increase in deposits during at december and december we had million and million of traditional outofmarket brokered deposits at december and december we had million and million respectively of reciprocal brokered deposits total deposits were billion at december an increase of billion from billion at december our deposit growth since december included an increase in interestbearing transaction accounts of billion an increase in demand deposit accounts of billion and an increase in savings and money market accounts of billion partially offset by a decline in certificates of deposit of million total shortterm borrowings at december were million consisting of million in federal funds purchased and million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase corporate and subordinated debentures decreased approximately million in as the company redeemed million in trust preferred securities and million in subordinated debentures in addition to the repayment of million of subordinated notes that matured during the second quarter of with the redemption of the trust preferred securities the remaining fair value mark on these borrowings of was written off as an extinguishment of debt cost to the extent that we employ other types of nondeposit funding sources typically to accommodate retail and correspondent customers we continue to take in shorter maturities of such funds our current approach may provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise through the operations of our bank we have made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of our business activities these commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to our customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time we manage the credit risk on these commitments by subjecting them to normal underwriting and risk management processes we believe that we have adequate sources of liquidity to fund commitments that are drawn upon by the borrowers in addition to commitments to extend credit we also issue standby letters of credit which are assurances to third parties that they will not suffer a loss if our customer fails to meet its contractual obligation to the thirdparty although our past experience indicates that many of these standby letters of credit will expire unused through our various sources of liquidity we believe that we will have the necessary resources to meet these obligations should the need arise our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets typically including some level of reverse repurchase agreements federal funds sold balances at the federal reserve bank andor other shortterm investments asset quality well capitalized position and profitable operating results cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our desired liquidity position at any time we expect that these conditions would generally be of a short term nature under such circumstances we expect our reverse repurchase agreements and federal funds sold positions or balances at the federal reserve bank if any to serve as the primary source of immediate liquidity at december we had total federal funds credit lines of million with no outstanding advances if we needed additional liquidity we would turn to short term borrowings as an alternative immediate funding source and would consider other appropriate actions such as promotions to increase core deposits or the use of the brokered deposit markets at december we had million of credit available at the federal reserve banks discount window but had no outstanding advances as of the end of in addition we could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks andor the fhlb at december we had a total fhlb credit facility of billion with million in outstanding fhlb letters of credit to secure certain public funds deposits leaving billion in availability on the fhlb credit facility we have a million unsecured line of credit with us bank national association with no outstanding advances we believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available our contingency funding plan describes several potential stages based on stressed liquidity levels liquidity key risk indicators are reported to the board of directors on a quarterly basis during we conducted contingency funding plan stress tests on a quarterly basis we maintain various wholesale sources of funding if our deposit retention efforts were to be unsuccessful we would utilize these alternative sources of funding under such circumstances depending on the external source of funds our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates charged this could increase our cost of funds impacting our net interest margin and net interest spread assetliability management and market risk sensitivity our earnings and the economic value of equity vary in relation to the behavior of interest rates and the accompanying fluctuations in market prices of certain of our financial instruments we define interest rate risk as the risk to earnings and equity arising from the behavior of interest rates these behaviors include increases and decreases in interest rates as well as continuation of the current interest rate environment our interest rate risk principally consists of reprice option basis and yield curve risk reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing characteristics of asset and liability portfolios option risk arises from embedded options in the investment and loan portfolios such as investment securities calls and loan prepayment options option risk also exists since deposit customers may withdraw funds at their discretion in response to general market conditions competitive alternatives to existing accounts or other factors the exercise of such options may result in higher costs or lower revenue basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices which subsequently result in narrowing spreads on interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities basis risk also exists in administered rate liabilities such as interestbearing checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts where the price sensitivity of such products may vary relative to general markets rates yield curve risk adverse consequences of nonparallel shifts in the yield curves of various market indices that impact our assets and liabilities we use simulation analysis as a primary method to assess earnings at risk and equity at risk due to assumed changes in interest rates management uses the results of its various simulation analyses in combination with other data and observations to formulate strategies designed to maintain interest rate risk within risk tolerances simulation analysis involves the use of several assumptions including but not limited to the timing of cash flows such as the terms of contractual agreements investment security calls loan prepayment speeds deposit attrition rates the interest rate sensitivity of loans and deposits relative to general market rates and the behavior of interest rates and spreads equity at risk simulation uses assumptions regarding discount rates that value cash flows simulation analysis is highly dependent on model assumptions that may vary from actual outcomes key simulation assumptions are subject to stress testing to assess the impact of assumption changes on earnings at risk and equity at risk model assumptions are reviewed by our assumptions committee earnings at risk is defined as the percentage change in net interest income due to assumed changes in interest rates earnings at risk is generally used to assess interest rate risk over relatively short time horizons equity at risk is defined as the percentage change in the net economic value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value the discounted present value of all cash flows represents our economic value of equity equity at risk is generally considered a measure of the longterm interest rate exposures of the balance sheet at a point in time the earnings simulation models take into account our contractual agreements with regard to investments loans deposits borrowings and derivatives as well as a number of behavioral assumptions applied to certain assets and liabilities mortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist of forward sales contracts and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans these derivatives involve underlying items such as interest rates and are designed to mitigate risk derivatives are also used to hedge mortgage servicing rights for additional information see note 28derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements from time to time we execute interest rate swaps to hedge some of our interest rate risks under these arrangements the company enters into a variable rate loan with a client in addition to a swap agreement the swap agreement effectively converts the clients variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan the company then enters into a matching swap agreement with a thirdparty dealer to offset its exposure on the customer swap the company may also execute interest rate swap agreements that are not specific to client loans as of december the company did not have such agreements for additional information on these derivatives refer to note 28derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements our interest rate risk key indicators are applied to a static balance sheet using forward rates from the moodys baseline scenario this base case scenario assumes the maturity composition of asset and liability rollover volumes is modeled to approximately replicate current consolidated balance sheet characteristics throughout the simulation these treatments are consistent with the companys goal of assessing current interest rate risk embedded in its current balance sheet the base case scenario assumes that maturing or repricing assets and liabilities are replaced at current market prices consistent with maintaining a stable balance sheet key rate drivers are used to price assets and liabilities with sensitivity assumptions used to price nonmaturity deposits the sensitivity assumptions for the pricing of nonmaturity deposits are subjected to stress testing no less frequently than on an annual basis interest rate shocks are applied to the base case on an instantaneous basis the range of interest rate shocks will include upward and downward movements of rates through basis points in basis point increments at times market conditions may result in assumed rate movements that will be deemphasized for example during a period of ultralow interest rates certain downward rate shocks may be impractical the model simulation results produced from the base case scenario and related instantaneous shocks for changes in net interest income and instantaneous rate shocks for changes in the economic value of equity are referred to as the core scenario analysis and constitute the policy key risk indicators for interest rate risk when compared to risk tolerances as of december the earnings simulations indicated that the impact of an instantaneous basis point increase decrease in rates would result in an estimated increase up and decrease down in net interest income we use economic value of equity eve analysis as an indicator of the extent to which the present value of our capital could change given potential changes in interest rates this measure also assumes a static balance sheet base case scenario with rate shocks applied as described above at december the percentage change in eve due to a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates was and respectively the percentage change in eve due to a basis point increase in interest rates was simulation analysis involves the use of several assumptions including but not limited to the timing of cash flows such as investment security calls loan prepayment speeds deposit attrition rates the interest rate sensitivity of loans and deposits relative to general market rates and the behavior of interest rates and spreads furthermore equity at risk simulation uses assumptions regarding discount rates that value cash flows simulation analysis is highly dependent on model assumptions that may vary from actual outcomes for example higher levels of interest rate sensitivity of deposits to upward movements in interest rates may adversely impact net interest income additionally slower prepayment speeds of loans may adversely impact the economic value of equity in a rising interest rate environment key simulation assumptions are subject to stress testing to assess the impact of assumption changes on earnings at risk and equity at risk the analysis provided below assumes the base case the moodys baseline forecast as described above parallel and sustained interest rate shocks are applied over a oneyear time horizon on an instantaneous and ramped basis instantaneous shocks assume immediate sustained interest rate shocks whereas ramped shocks distribute the assumed change in rates attributable to the shock evenly across the oneyear time horizon this analysis is applied to a static balance sheet that assumes maturing or repricing assets and liabilities are replaced at current market prices and volumes consistent with maintaining a stable balance sheet with the exception of ppp loans that are not assumed to be replaced the downward rate shock is subject to product floors and a zerointerest rate table 28rate shock analysis net interest

financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor at the end of on march the fca confirmed that all libor settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after december for the oneweek and twomonth us dollar settings and immediately after june for all remaining us dollar settings the alternative reference rates committee has proposed secured overnight financing rate sofr as its preferred rate as an alternative to libor and has proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from libor organizations are currently working on industrywide and companyspecific transition plans related to derivatives and cash markets exposed to libor as noted within part i item risk factors of the this form 10k for the year ended we hold instruments that may be impacted by the discontinuance of libor including floating rate obligations loans deposits derivatives and hedges and other financial instruments but is not able to currently predict the associated financial impact of the transition to an alternative reference rate we have established a crossfunctional libor transition working group that has assessed the companys current exposure to libor indexed instruments and the data systems and processes that will be impacted established a detailed implementation plan and developed a formal governance structure for the transition the company is in the process of developing and implementing various proactive steps to facilitate the transition on behalf of customers which include table start the adoption and ongoing implementation of fallback provisions that provide for the determination of replacement rates for liborlinked financial products table endtable start the adoption of new products linked to alternative reference rates such as adjustablerate mortgages consistent with guidance provided by the us regulators the alternative reference rates committee and gses table endtable start the selection of sofr indices as the replacement indices and successful completion of systems testing using the sofr replacement indices table end the company discontinued quoting libor on september and discontinued originating new products linked to libor on december the company continues to evaluate its financial and operational infrastructure in its effort to transition all financial and strategic processes systems and models to reference rates other than libor the company is in the process of developing and implementing processes to educate clientfacing associates and coordinate communications with customers regarding the transition as of december the company had the following exposures to libor table start approximately billion of total outstanding loans reference libor of this amount billion have maturities occurring after the libor discontinuation date of june table endtable start approximately billion in interest rate swaps that are indexed to libor with a gross positive fair value of million and a gross negative fair value of million however the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements therefore the transition to libor will have no hedge accounting impact as changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings moreover the exposure of both sides of these swaps are presented in these figures these exposures are intended to offset each other table endtable start trust preferred securities that reference libor and had a total principal balance of million these securities have maturities ranging from october through march table endtable start subordinated debt that references libor that had a principal balance of million this debt matures june and has an initial call date of june table end asset credit risk and concentrations the quality of our interest earning assets is maintained through our management of certain concentrations of credit risk we review each individual earning asset including investment securities and loans for credit risk to facilitate this review we have established credit and investment policies that include credit limits documentation periodic examination and follow up in addition we examine these portfolios for exposure to concentration in any one industry government agency or geographic location loan and deposit concentration we have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers we have no significant portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries furthermore we attempt to avoid making loans that in an aggregate amount exceed of total loans to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities at december and there were no aggregated loan concentrations of this type we do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us we do not have material foreign loans or deposits concentration of credit risk each category of earning assets has a certain degree of credit risk we use various techniques to measure credit risk credit risk in the investment portfolio can be measured through bond ratings published by independent agencies in the investment securities portfolio the investments consist of us governmentsponsored entity securities tax free securities or other securities having ratings of aaa to not rated all securities with the exception of those that are not rated were rated by at least one of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations the credit risk of the loan portfolio can be measured by historical experience we maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with credit policies that we have established although the subsidiary has a diversified loan portfolio a substantial portion of their borrowers abilities to honor their contracts is dependent upon economic conditions within our geographic footprint and the surrounding regions we consider concentrations of credit to exist when pursuant to regulatory guidelines the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents of tier capital plus regulatory adjusted allowance for credit losses of the company or million at december based on this criteria we had seven such credit concentrations at december including loans on hotels and motels of million loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings except miniwarehouses of billion loans secured by owner occupied office buildings including medical office buildings of billion loans secured by owner occupied nonresidential buildings excluding office buildings of billion loans to lessors of residential buildings investment properties and multifamily of billion loans secured by st mortgage family owner occupied residential property including condos and home equity lines of billion and loans secured by jumbo original loans greater than st mortgage family owner occupied residential property of billion the risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time the loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard acl methodology with some financial institutions adopting cecl in the first quarter of banking regulators established new guidelines for calculating credit concentrations banking regulators set the guidelines for construction land development and other land loans to total less than of total tier capital less modified cecl transitional amount plus acl cdl concentration ratio and for total commercial real estate loans construction land development and other land loans along with other nonowner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans to total less than of total tier capital less modified cecl transitional amount plus acl cre concentration ratio both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the banks total tier capital less modified cecl transitional amount plus acl at december the banks cdl concentration ratio was and its cre concentration ratio was at december the banks cdl concentration ratio was and its cre concentration ratio was as of december and the bank was below the established regulatory guidelines when a banks ratios are in excess of one or both of these loan concentration ratios guidelines banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management therefore we monitor these two ratios as part of our concentration management processes effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require the measure of financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars without
