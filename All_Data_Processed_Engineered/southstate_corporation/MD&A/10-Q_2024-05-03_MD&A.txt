our results of operations for the quarter ended march compared to the quarter ended march and also analyzes our financial condition as of march as compared to december like most financial institutions we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits on which we may pay interest consequently one of the key measures of our success is the amount of our net interest income or the difference between the income on our interestearning assets such as loans and investments and the expense on our interestbearing liabilities such as deposits another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interestearning assets and the rate we pay on our interestbearing liabilities of course there are risks inherent in all loans as such we maintain an allowance for credit losses otherwise referred to herein as acl to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible we establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for credit losses against our operating earnings in the following discussion we have included a detailed discussion of this process in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers we incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits we describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following

earnings per share eps of for the first quarter of as compared to consolidated net income of million or diluted earnings of in the comparable period of a decrease in consolidated net income and a decrease in diluted eps the million decrease in consolidated net income was the net result of the following items a million increase in interest income resulting from a million increase in interest income from loans and loans held for sale partially offset by a million decrease in interest income from investment securities and a decrease in interest income on federal funds sold securities purchased under agreement to resell and interestbearing deposits the increase in interest income from loans was due to an increase in the yield as loans continued to reprice higher from the rising rate environment in and in as the federal reserve bank raised its federal funds rate by basis points the increase in interest income was also due to an increase in the average balance of loans of billion through organic loan growth a million increase in interest expense which resulted from a million increase in interest expense from deposits a million increase in interest expense in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense from corporate and subordinated debentures and other borrowings the increase in interest expense from deposits resulted mainly from an increase in costs due to the higher interest rate environment with the increase in interest rates in and this increase in average cost of deposits was felt throughout starting with the stress in the financial markets and liquidity that occurred in march with the closure of a few failed financial institutions the average cost of deposits excluding noninterest bearing deposits increased by basis points compared to the first quarter of a million decrease in the provision for credit losses as the company recorded a provision for credit losses of million in the first quarter of while recording a provision for credit losses of million in the first quarter of during the first quarter of we recorded a lower provision for credit losses as economic forecasts improved since the first quarter of with inflation falling and interest rates stabilizing along with lower new loan growth in the first quarter of compared to the same period in a increase in noninterest income primarily from an increase in service charges on deposit accounts of million in debit prepaid atm and merchant card related income of million in mortgage

an million increase in noninterest expense which resulted primarily from an increase in salaries and employee benefits of million an accrual for the fdic special assessment of million in fdic assessment and other regulatory charges of million and an information services expense of million these increases were partially offset by declines in merger branch consolidation severance related and other expense of million and amortization of intangibles of million see noninterest expense section on page for further discussion and lower income tax provision of primarily due to lower pretax book income between the two quarters the company recorded pretax book income of million in the first quarter of compared to pretax book income of million in the first quarter of the effects of the lower pretax book income were mostly offset by the effects of the company adopting asu in the first quarter of whereby it applied the proportional amortization method of accounting related to its low income housing tax credits partnerships lihtc with the adoption of asu the amortization of the lihtcs is now recorded within provision for income taxes rather than other noninterest expense on the statement

note summary of significant accounting policies under the acl loans section of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december and note significant accounting policies in this quarterly report on form 10q for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the acl on loans management considers forwardlooking information in estimating expected credit losses the company subscribes to a thirdparty service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the united states economy the baseline along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios is used by management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses management evaluates the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and takes into consideration the scenarios in relation to actual economic and other data such as gross domestic product growth monetary and fiscal policy inflation supply chain issues and global events like the russianukraine conflict and unrest in middle east as well as the volatility and magnitude of changes within those scenarios quarter over quarter and consideration of conditions within the banks operating environment and geographic area additional forecast scenarios may be weighted along with the baseline forecast to arrive at the final reserve estimate while periods of relative economic stability should generally lead to stability in forecast scenarios and weightings to estimate credit losses periods of instability can likewise require management to adjust the selection of scenarios and weightings in accordance with the accounting standards for the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period the company reverts to the long term mean of historical factors within four quarters using a straightline approach the company generally uses a fourquarter forecast and a fourquarter reversion period in spite of the rapid interest rate hikes experienced cycletodate the us has thus far avoided a recession although an inverted yield curve such as observed in the current interest rate environment often portends a coming recession management continues to use a blended forecast scenario of the baseline upside and more severe scenario depending on the circumstances and economic outlook for the quarter ending march management selected a baseline weighting of a weighting for an upside scenario and a weighting for the more severe scenario the scenario weightings were consistent with the first quarter of the scenario weightings reflect continued recognition of downside risks in the economic forecast from persistent levels of inflation rising interest rates and tightening credit conditions conducive of a mild recession while employment figures and recent commercial real estate market sales data still show resilience and actual loan losses remain at low levels continued projected weakness in the forecasted commercial real estate price index continues to elevate modeled expected losses for the commercial real estate and commercial construction and land development which excludes residential construction loan segments the resulting provision was approximately million during the first quarter of the company has a variety of assets that have a component that qualifies

decrease in accruing loans past due days or more of factored receivables which are trade credits rather than promissory notes loans that are deemed to be low risk acquired nonperforming loans

noninterestbearing deposits were billion for the first quarter of compared to billion for the first quarter of this decrease in the average noninterest bearing deposits from the quarter ended march was mainly due to customers seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment also customers have less excess cash as funds from government support programs related to the covid19 pandemic began to decline as well as the resulting effects of higher costs related to inflation uninsured deposits at march and december the company had approximately billion and billion respectively in estimated uninsured deposits the amounts above are estimates and are based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for the banks regulatory reporting requirements issued by the fdic for the ffiec also

capital to riskweighted assets ratio is refer to note capital ratios for more information regarding company and banks regulatory capital compliance requirements in response to the covid19 pandemic in the federal banking agencies issued a final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of cecl the company chose the fiveyear transition method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from the adoption date and the cecl difference for the first two years of application the modified cecl transitional amount was fixed as of december and that amount began the threeyear phase out in the first quarter of with phased out in at march approximately million was added to tier capital at the company and bank as a result of the modified cecl transition had the company elected not to apply the modified cecl transitional amount to its tier capital the company and bank would have still been considered well capitalized as of march the

tier leverage the companys and banks common equity tier riskbased capital tier riskbased capital and total riskbased capital and tier leverage ratios all improved compared to december all of these ratios mainly improved due to net income recognized during the first quarter of of million tier capital increased by and at both the company and bank respectively with the increase in equity from the net income recognized total riskbased capital increased by and at both the company and bank respectively with the increase in equity resulting from net income along with the increase in the allowance for credit losses and unfunded commitments includable in tier capital both regulatory riskbased assets and quarterly average assets remained reasonably flat compared to the fourth quarter with average assets for both the company and bank decreasing by and riskbased assets decreasing by our capital ratios are currently well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the well capitalized regulatory classification liquidity liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits extension of credit and payment of operating expenses liquidity risk is the risk that the banks financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by an inability or perceived inability to meet its obligations our asset liability management committee alco is charged with the responsibility of monitoring policies designed to ensure acceptable composition of our assetliability mix two critical areas of focus for alco are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management we have employed our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs the alco has established key risk indicators to monitor liquidity and interest rate risk the key risk indicators are reviewed and approved by the alco on an annual basis the liquidity key risk indicators include the loan to deposit ratio net noncore funding dependence ratio onhand liquidity to total liabilities ratio the percentage of securities pledged to total securities and the ratio of brokered deposits to total deposits as of march the company was operating within its liquidity policy limits asset liquidity is maintained by the maturity structure of loans investment securities and other shortterm investments management has policies and procedures governing the length of time to maturity on loans and investments normally changes in the earning asset mix are of a longerterm nature and are not used for daytoday corporate liquidity needs our liabilities provide liquidity on a daytoday basis daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased securities sold under agreements to repurchase interestbearing deposits at other banks and other shortterm borrowings we engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position these routine activities include various measures such as the following emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with our bank pricing deposits including certificates of deposit at rate levels that will attract and or retain balances of deposits that will enhance our banks assetliability management and net interest margin requirements and continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract customers or enhance our banks appeal as a primary provider of financial services our nonacquired loan portfolio increased by approximately million or approximately annualized compared to the balance at december the increase from december was mainly related to organic growth and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our nonacquired loan portfolio the acquired loan portfolio decreased by million from the balance at december through principal paydowns chargeoffs foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans our investment securities portfolio excluding trading securities decreased by million compared to the balance at december the decrease in investment securities from december was a result of maturities calls sales and paydowns of investment securities totaling million a reduction from the net amortization of premiums of million as well as decrease in the market value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio of million these decreases were partially offset by purchases of other investment securities totaling million there were no purchases of available for sale or held to maturity securities during the quarter the purchases of other investment securities were related to capital stock with the federal home loan bank of which we sold back million during the first quarter of the activity in the purchases and sales of the federal home loan bank capital stock was due to activity with fhlb borrowings during the year the bank pledges a portion of its investment portfolio for a variety of purposes including but not limited to collateral for public funds and credit with the federal home loan bank of atlanta as of march the bank pledged of the market value of its investment portfolio as of march the bank had unpledged securities with a market value of billion these securities included treasury agency agency mbs municipals and corporate securities total cash and cash equivalents were billion at march as compared to billion at december liquidity has tightened starting in with the rising rate environment and turmoil in the financial markets occurring in early competition for inmarket deposits has increased throughout and resulting in increases in deposit rates to retain local deposits the bank supplements its inmarket deposits with brokered deposits while the bank has a policy limit for brokered time deposits of no more than of total deposits it has operated well below this policy limit at march the percentage of brokered time deposits to total deposits was compared to at december during the first quarter of the company also borrowed funds from the fhlb on a shortterm basis however no fhlb advances were outstanding at march the outstanding borrowings from the fhlb were million at december see below for further discussion around brokered deposits and fhlb borrowings our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets typically including some level of reverse repurchase agreements federal funds sold balances at the federal reserve bank andor other shortterm investments asset quality wellcapitalized position and profitable operating results cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our desired liquidity position at any time we expect that these conditions would generally be of a shortterm nature under such circumstances we expect our reverse repurchase agreements and federal funds sold positions or balances at the federal reserve bank if any to serve as the primary source of immediate liquidity we could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks the bank may also access funds from borrowing facilities established with the federal home loan bank of atlanta and the discount window of the federal reserve bank of atlanta deposit flows are significantly influenced by general and local economic conditions changes in prevailing interest rates internal pricing decisions and competition our deposits are primarily obtained from depositors located around our branch footprint and we believe that we have attractive opportunities to capture additional retail and commercial deposits in our markets in addition to having access to brokered deposits of the billion in total deposits at march approximately were insured or collateralized the bank has a granular deposit base comprised of over million accounts with an average deposit size of the top ten and twenty deposit relationships compr ise approximately and of total deposits and approximately of total deposits are noninterest bearing the banks deposit beta which represents the change in the banks cost of deposits over the change in the federal funds target rate during this cycle from march through march is approximately at march and december we had million and million of traditional outofmarket brokered time deposits respectively at march and december we had billion and billion respectively of reciprocal brokered deposits total deposits were billion at march an increase of million from billion at december this increase in deposits from december was driven by an increase in money market accounts of million including million in reciprocal insured money market deposits along with a million increase in time deposits these increases were partially offset by declines in noninterestbearing deposits of million interestbearing checking deposits of million and savings deposits of million as customers moved funds from noninterestbearing deposits interestbearing checking and savings accounts seeking higher yields in the rising rate environment the company has seen an increase in its balance of higher yielding money market accounts and time deposits during the first quarter of the company raised interest rates on most interestbearing deposit products in particular money market accounts and time deposit specials due to competitive pressures to retain deposits total shortterm borrowings at march were million consisting of million in federal funds purchased and million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase total longterm borrowing at march were million and consisted of trust preferred securities and subordinated debentures to the extent that we employ other types of nondeposit funding sources typically to accommodate retail and correspondent customers we continue to take in shorter maturities of such funds our current approach may provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise in addition to deposits we have other contingency funding sources available to the bank at march our bank had a total fhlb credit facility of billion with million in fhlb letters of credit outstanding at quarterend leaving billion in availability on the fhlb credit facility in addition our bank had billion of credit available at the federal reserve banks discount window and total federal funds credit lines of million with no balances outstanding at quarterend the bank also has an internal limit on brokered deposits of of total deposits which would allow capacity of billion as of march the bank had million of outstanding brokered deposits at the end of the quarter leaving billion in available capacity all of these resources provide billion of additional funding for the bank in addition the bank has billion in market value of unpledged securities at march that can be pledged to obtain additional funds if necessary the company has a million unsecured line of credit with us bank national association with no balance outstanding at march we believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available as discussed previously and presented below the bank maintains credit facilities with the federal home loan bank of atlanta and the federal reserve bank of atlanta the table below compares primary funding sources to uninsured deposits as of march  in millions available capacity federal home loan bank of atlanta federal reserve bank of atlanta discount window cash and cash equivalents fair value of securities that can be pledged total primary sources uninsured deposits excluding collateralized deposits uninsured and collateralized deposits coverage ratio uninsured deposits coverage ratio uninsured and collateralized deposits ratio of uninsured and collateralized deposits to total deposits in addition to adequate liquidity the company and bank are considered well capitalized by all regulatory capital standards as the company and the bank were significantly above the required capital levels as of march the companys tier leverage ratio cet riskbased capital ratio and total riskbased capital ratio were and respectively at march the banks tier leverage ratio cet riskbased capital ratio and total riskbased capital ratio were and respectively at march as permitted we elected to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income related to available for sale securities from tier cet and total riskbased capital however even if our unrealized losses as of march in our available for sale and held to maturity investment portfolios were recognized by selling the portfolios for liquidity purposes all else being equal our regulatory capital ratios would remain well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the well capitalized regulatory classification through the operations of our bank we have made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of our business activities these commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to our customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time we manage the credit risk on these commitments by subjecting them to normal underwriting and risk management processes we believe that we have adequate sources of liquidity to fund commitments that are drawn upon by the borrowers in addition to commitments to extend credit we also issue standby letters of credit which are assurances to third parties that they will not suffer a loss if our customer fails to meet its contractual obligation to the thirdparty although our experience indicates that many of these standby letters of credit will expire unused through our various sources of liquidity we believe that we will have the resources to meet these obligations should the need arise our contingency funding plan describes several potential stages based on stressed liquidity levels liquidity key risk indicators are reported to the board of directors on a quarterly basis as noted previously we maintain various wholesale sources of funding if our deposit retention efforts were to be unsuccessful we would use these alternative sources of funding under such circumstances depending on the external source of funds our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates charged this could increase our cost of funds impacting our net interest margin and net interest spread assetliability management and market risk sensitivity our earnings and the economic value of equity vary in relation to the behavior of interest rates and the accompanying fluctuations in market prices of certain of our financial instruments we define interest rate risk as the risk to earnings and equity arising from the behavior of interest rates these behaviors include increases and decreases in interest rates as well as continuation of the current interest rate environment our interest rate risk principally consists of reprice option basis and yield curve risk reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing characteristics of asset and liability portfolios option risk arises from embedded options in the investment and loan portfolios such as investment securities calls and loan prepayment options option risk also exists since deposit customers may withdraw funds at their discretion in response to general market conditions competitive alternatives to existing accounts or other factors the exercise of such options may result in higher costs or lower revenue basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices which subsequently result in narrowing spreads on interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities basis risk also exists in administered rate liabilities such as interestbearing checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts where the price sensitivity of such products may vary relative to general markets rates yield curve risk refers to adverse consequences of nonparallel shifts in the yield curves of various market indices that impact our assets and liabilities we use simulation analysis as a primary method to assess earnings at risk and equity at risk due to assumed changes in interest rates management uses the results of its various simulation analyses in combination with other data and observations to formulate strategies designed to maintain interest rate risk within risk tolerances simulation analysis involves the use of several assumptions including but not limited to the timing of cash flows such as the terms of contractual agreements investment security calls loan prepayment speeds deposit attrition rates the interest rate sensitivity of loans and deposits relative to general market rates and the behavior of interest rates and spreads the assumptions for loan prepayments deposit decay and nonstable deposit balances are derived from models that use historical bank data these models are independently validated equity at risk simulation uses assumptions regarding discount rates that value cash flows simulation analysis is highly dependent on model assumptions that may vary from actual outcomes key simulation assumptions are subject to sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of assumption changes on earnings at risk and equity at risk model assumptions are reviewed by our assumptions committee while the bank is continuously refining its modeling methodology the core principles of the methodology have remained stable over the past two years earnings at risk is defined as the percentage change in net interest income due to assumed changes in interest rates earnings at risk is generally used to assess interest rate risk over relatively short time horizons equity at risk is defined as the percentage change in the net economic value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value the discounted present value of all cash flows represents our economic value of equity equity at risk is generally considered a measure of the longterm interest rate exposures of the balance sheet at a point in time the earnings simulation models consider our contractual agreements with regard to investments loans deposits borrowings and derivatives as well as a number of behavioral assumptions applied to certain assets and liabilities mortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist of forward sales contracts and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans these derivatives involve underlying items such as interest rates and are designed to mitigate risk derivatives are also used to hedge mortgage servicing rights for additional information see note derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements from time to time we execute interest rate swaps to hedge some of our interest rate risks under these arrangements the company enters into a variable rate loan with a client in addition to a swap agreement the swap agreement effectively converts the clients variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan the company then enters into a matching swap agreement with a thirdparty dealer to offset its exposure on the customer swap the company may also execute interest rate swap agreements that are not specific to client loans as of march the company had a series of shortterm interest rate hedges to address monthly accrual mismatches related to the companys arc program and its transition from libor to sofr after june for additional information on these derivatives refer to note derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements our interest rate risk key indicators are applied to a static balance sheet using forward rates from the moodys baseline scenario the company will also use other rate forecasts including but not limited to moodys consensus scenario this base case scenario assumes the maturity composition of asset and liability rollover volumes is modeled to approximately replicate current consolidated balance sheet characteristics throughout the simulation these treatments are consistent with the companys goal of assessing current interest rate risk embedded in its current balance sheet the base case scenario assumes that maturing or repricing assets and liabilities are replaced at prices referencing forward rates derived from the selected rate forecast consistent with current balance sheet pricing characteristics key rate drivers are used to price assets and liabilities with sensitivity assumptions used to price nonmaturity deposits the sensitivity assumptions for the pricing of nonmaturity deposits are subjected to sensitivity analysis no less frequently than on an annual basis interest rate shocks are applied to the base case on an instantaneous basis our policy establishes the use of upward and downward interest rate shocks applied in basis point increments through basis points we calculate smaller rate shocks as needed at times market conditions may result in assumed rate movements that will be deemphasized for example during a period of ultralow interest rates certain downward rate shocks may be impractical the model simulation results produced from the base case scenario and related instantaneous shocks for changes in net interest income and changes in the economic value of equity are referred to as the core scenario analysis and constitute the policy key risk indicators for interest rate risk when compared to risk tolerances as of march the company was operating within its interest rate key risk indicator policy limits during and the first quarter of the beta assumption applied to total deposits increased to reflect changes in deposit mix from the beginning of the upward rate cycle our deposit costs have increased from five basis points to one hundred and seventyfour basis points during this period the federal funds rate has increased basis points accordingly our cycle to date beta has been approximately management recognizes the difficulty in using historical data to forecast deposit betas in the current environment for internal purposes and based on the deposit mix as of march the total deposit beta assumption was for internal forecasting management will apply overlays to certain assumptions to adjust for current market conditions rather than use assumptions modeled over longer periods of time the following interest rate risk metrics are derived from analysis using the moodys baseline scenario published in april as the base case scenario as of march the earnings simulations indicated that the year impact of an instantaneous basis point parallel increase decrease in rates would result in an estimated increase up and decrease down in net interest income we use economic value of equity eve analysis as an indicator of the extent to which the present value of our capital could change given potential changes in interest rates this measure also assumes a static balance sheet base case scenario with rate shocks applied as described above at march the percentage change in eve due to a 100basis point increase or decrease in interest rates was decrease and increase respectively the percentage changes in eve due to a 200basis point increase or decrease in interest rates were decrease and decrease respectively the interest rate shock analysis results for eve sensitivities are unusual as the benefits of repricing assets are mitigated by increasing deposit costs and downward shocks are constrained on various balance sheet categories due to the inability to price products below floors or zero this is particularly meaningful given the cost of deposits as of march the analysis below reflects a base case and shocked scenarios that assume a static balance sheet projection where volume is added to maintain balances consistent with current levels base case assumes new and repricing volumes reference forward rates derived from the moodys baseline rate forecast instantaneous parallel and sustained interest rate shocks are applied to the base case scenario over a oneyear time horizon percentage change in net interest income over one year up basis points up basis points up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points down basis points down basis points deposit concentrations at march and december we have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers we have no significant portion of our deposits concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries we do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us the total deposit balances held by top and deposit holders were below of the companys average total

policies that we have established although the bank has a diversified loan portfolio a substantial portion of our borrowers abilities to honor their contracts is dependent upon economic conditions within our geographic footprint and the surrounding regions we consider concentrations of credit to exist when pursuant to regulatory guidelines the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents of total tier capital plus regulatory adjusted allowance for credit

concentration ratio and for total commercial real estate loans construction land development and other land loans along with other nonowner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans to total less than of total tier capital less modified cecl transitional amount plus acl cre concentration ratio both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the banks total tier capital less modified cecl transitional amount plus acl at march and december the banks cdl concentration ratio was and respectively and its cre concentration ratio was and respectively as of march the bank was below the established regulatory guidelines when a banks ratios are in excess of one or both of these loan concentration ratios guidelines banking
