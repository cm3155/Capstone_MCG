begin with a review of our financial condition and results on slide of this presentation this morning we reported third quarter net income of million or per share up from second quarter net income of million or per share our third quarter return on average assets was return on average equity was and return on average tangible equity was our profitability rebounded from the trough of the second quarter as provision for credit losses declined deposit growth this quarter was very healthy but especially strong growth in noninterestbearing demand account which grew annualized quarteroverquarter based on periodend balances and annualized based on average balances as of september we reached a record billion in deposits including a record billion in demand deposit accounts we generate a positive loan growth also in the third quarter reaching a record billion in loans as of september despite a challenging backdrop of slow economic activity due to the covid19 pandemic the biggest driver for the quarteroverquarter increases in net income was a reduction in the provision for credit losses which was million in the third quarter compared to million in the second quarter in the first half of the year we recorded million in provision for credit losses compared to net chargeoffs of million substantially building our reserve level based on an improved macroeconomic outlook we modestly decreased our allowance for loan losses as of september overall credit continues to be very manageable as demonstrated by net chargeoffs at annualized basis point of average loans also in the third quarter we earned million of pretax preprovision income on total revenue of million our pretax preprovision profitability ratio was the steep decline in interest rates this year has impacted our revenue however as the downward repricing of our earning assets to benchmark rate is largely complete and we continue to reduce the cost of funds as maturing cds reprice lower we anticipate that our pretax pre provision income and profitability will stabilize going forward importantly our efficiency remains industryleading and is a key variable to maintaining above average pretax preprovision profitability our efficiency ratio in the third quarter was moving to slide for a summary review of our balance sheet our balance sheet is strong we have high levels of liquidity and capital and as of september weve crossed over than billion in assets milestone ending the quarter at billion this translates to an organic compound annual growth rate of over the past five years quarteroverquarter total loans of billion increased million or linked quarter annualized total deposits of billion increased billion or annualized our deposit growth is a combination of east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 onboarding new clients expanding existing relationships and our clients maintaining high levels of liquidity we believe the momentum of strong deposit growth can be sustained postpandemic due to our deposit growth this quarter our loan to deposit ratio as of september was compared to as of june now turning to slide you can see that east west capital ratios are strong and growing and are some of the highest among regional banks particularly for common and tier equity our book value and tangible equity share were both up from the prior quarter and our tangible equity to tangible assets ratio increased to you can see from the chart that all our capital ratios increased quarteroverquarter east west board of directors has declared fourth quarter dividends for the companys common stock a common stock cash dividend of is payable on november to stockholders of record on november moving on to a discussion about loan portfolio beginning with slide ci loans excluding ppp were billion as of september or of total loans total ci commitments excluding ppp were billion as of september a quarteroverquarter increase of annually monthovermonth growth of loans outstanding turned positive in september reversing a trend of negative monthly growth since march overall ci loans outstanding excluding ppp decreased by million between june and september a decrease of annualized compared to a decrease of annualized in the second quarter moving to slide as of september our total commercial real estate portfolio was billion or of total loans total commercial real estate loans grew million or annualized from june the portfolio is well balanced across the major property types of retail multifamily office industrial and hotel our exposure to construction and land loans remain low at of total loans you can see on slide that the weighted average loan to value of our total commercial real estate portfolio is with an average loan size of only million nearly of our commercial real estate loans have an ltv of or lower in the chart on the right you can see that the weighted average loan to value of our loans by property type range from to on slides and we provide additional details regarding our single family residential loans and home equity lines combined residential mortgage and other consumer loans make up of our total loans as of september our single family residential portfolio was billion up by million or annualized from june in the third quarter we originated million of residential mortgage loans consistent with the pace from the first half of and up by yearoveryear from the third quarter of last year we expect a similar pace of origination for the fourth quarter the average loan size in our residential mortgage portfolio is only and the weighted average loan to value was again of our residential mortgage loans have an ltv loan to value of or less on to slide as of september we have billion of home equity lines outstanding plus billion in undisbursed commitments translating into a utilization rate of unchanged from last quarter home equity lines outstanding increased million quarteroverquarter or

loan to value of under east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 i will now turn the call over to irene for a more detailed discussion of our asset quality and income statement irene h oh executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thank you dominic ill start by discussing loans on covid19related deferrals on slide as of october loans on full payment deferral were of total loans including loans on partial payment deferral indiscernible were modifications of principal and interest payment to interest only loans on deferral totaled overall of commercial loans on deferral are still making partial payments quarteroverquarter loans on covid19related deferral decreased close to between june and september and decreased a further monthtodate in october the largest improvement was in residential mortgage deferrals which decreased by since june reflecting the resiliency of the east west customer base similar to the second quarter the deferral rate on ci loans continued to be very low commercial real estate loans on deferral have also decreased down to as of october comprised of on partial payments and on full payment deferral largely reflecting the longer covid19 impact on cash flows for certain properties turning to slide for a review of our allowance for loan losses and slide for a review of our other asset quality metrics our allowance for loan losses was million as of september or of loans held for investment modestly down from million or of loans as of june since january postcecl our allowance increased million and the coverage ratio increased by basis points from the current macroeconomic forecast has improved projecting less severe economic conditions compared to june this in turn decreased the expected lifetime losses for the loan portfolio the forecastdriven reduction to the allowance was partially offset by increased qualitative reserves for oil and gas and commercial real estate loans the allowance coverage of our oil and gas portfolio was as of september up from as of june net chargeoffs for the second quarter were just under million and the net chargeoff ratio was basis points of average loans annualized chargeoffs in the third quarter were primarily from oil and gas loans which accounted for million or of net chargeoffs while chargeoffs from other loan classes remain at low levels reflecting these drivers and assumptions we recorded a million provision for credit losses during the third quarter of compared to million in the second quarter turning to slide on this page we detail out the components of criticized assets criticized loans were of total loans as of september totaling billion the largest concentration within criticized loans by either industry or property type remains oil and gas although criticized ci loans are diversified by industry and the criticized commercial real estate loans are likewise largely diversified by property type special mention loans were of total loans as of september in the amount of million up from of total loans as of june an increase of the quarteroverquarter increase in special mention loans was largely due to inflows from commercial real estate as of september of oil and gas loans of all other ci loans and of commercial real estate loans were graded special mention classified loans were of total loans as of september in the amount of million compared to as of june an increase of the quarteroverquarter increase in classified loans was largely driven by east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 downgrades of oil and gas loans followed by downgrades of all other ci loans as of september of oil and gas loans of all other ci and of commercial real estate loans were classified nonperforming assets were basis points of total assets as of september in the amount of million compared to basis points as of june an increase of the quarteroverquarter increase in nonperforming assets was primarily due to net inflows of previously classified oil and gas loans to nonaccrual status lastly accruing loans to days past due were million or basis points of total loans as of september a quarteroverquarter improvement of from million or basis points of total loans as of june as you can see in our credit quality metrics outside of oil and gas asset quality is moving across our other loan portfolios in terms of oil and gas id like to note that we continue to reduce our exposures through paydowns workouts and chargeoffs oil and gas loans outstanding are down quarteroverquarter and down yeartodate including undisbursed commitments total oil and gas commitments are down quarteroverquarter and down yeartodate in terms of hedges in place for our ep borrowers of their planned oil production is hedged and of their planned gas production is hedged and now moving to a discussion of our income statement on page this slide summarizes the key line items of the income statement which i will discuss in more detail on the following slides amortization of tax credit and other investments was million in the third quarter compared to million in the second quarter the quarter overquarter change reflects timing of tax credit investments and we expect this number to be approximately million in the fourth quarter the effective tax rate for the third quarter was up from in the second quarter of the quarterover quarter increase in the tax rate reflects the increase in pretax income third quarter income before taxes was million a increase from million in the second quarter as we increased our estimate for the full year effective tax rate to the effective tax rate for the third quarter includes a trueup to the higher full year effective tax rate the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter should be close to the full year effective tax rate of ill now review the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin on slides through starting with average balance sheet growth third quarter average loans of billion grew quarteroverquarter growth in commercial real estate residential mortgage and ppp loans was offset by a decrease in ci loans third quarter average deposits of billion grew linked quarter annualized driven by strong growth in demand and checking accounts offset by a reduction in highcost time deposits average noninterestbearing deposit accounts grew linked quarter annualized and made up of total deposits in the third quarter up from in the second quarter and in the yearago quarter with a strong deposit growth in excess of loan growth the average loan to deposit ratio decreased to in the third quarter down from in the second quarter excluding ppp loans where we match funded with the ppplf the average loan to deposit ratio was in the third quarter accordingly average interestbearing cash and deposits with banks increased by billion in the third quarter and made up of average earning assets up from in the second quarter this growth on loweryielding assets was a headwind to the net interest margin this quarter we continue to deploy excess liquidity into availableforsale securities but given the low interest rates and the flat curve attractive opportunities are limited east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 in the current environment we are comfortable in managing the balance sheet with a higher level of liquidity and recognize that when loan growth accelerates as it is starting to this headwind to net interest margin will largely selfcure on slide you can see that third quarter net interest income of million decreased by million or linked quarter and the net interest margin of compressed by basis points from the prior quarter however excluding the impact of ppp loans and the ppplf third quarter adjusted net interest income of million declined by or million quarteroverquarter exhibiting relative stability third quarter adjusted net interest margin of compressed by basis points from second quarter ppp loan interest and deferred fee income was million in the third quarter down from million in the second quarter the quarteroverquarter fluctuation is due to changes we made to our estimate for expected forgiveness of ppp loans by the sba resulting in reduced deferred fee accretion for the third quarter the quarteroverquarter change in net interest margin breaks down as follows negative basis points from lower loan yields negative basis points from lower other earning asset yields negative basis points from excess liquidity with higher balances of interestbearing cash and deposits with banks as well as a negative basis points of interestbearing cash and deposits with banks as well as a negative basis points of negative impact from less ppp income partially offset by basis points from a lower cost of deposits and basis point from a lower cost of borrowings headwinds then have been deposit growth in excess of loan growth a lack of attractive redeployment yields for excess liquidity but we see several tailwinds that should improve the nim and the net interest income going forward for the fourth quarter of we anticipate that our gaap net interest income will grow by to and that our gaap net interest margin will range from to including ppp income the drivers for our net interest income and nim outlook are as follows first continued reduction in deposit costs from the repricing of maturing cds we have billion in cds at a weighted average interest rate of maturing in the fourth quarter and another billion at a weighted average interest rate of in  of second partial repayment of the ppplf ahead of ppp loan forgiveness for our customers a process that we have already begun monthtodate in october we repaid million also we expect to recognize million of ppp loan deferred fee and interest income in the fourth quarter and thirdly general stability for loan yields as downward repricing of variable rate loans has largely run its course now turning to slide third quarter average loan yields of contracted by basis points from last quarter reflecting downward repricing of variable rate loans to benchmark interest rates as well as the reduced fee income accreted on ppp loans excluding the impact of ppp the third quarter adjusted loan yield of contracted by basis points quarter overquarter in the second quarter the quarteroverquarter contraction and the average loan yield excluding the impact of ppp was basis points of east west loan portfolio is variable rate and by now these loans have largely repriced nearly of variable rate loans we have are linked to benchmark interest rates with a duration of three months or less in the upper right quadrant weve laid out a new chart showing our average loan yields by portfolio as you can see our single family residential mortgage product is a least ratesensitive portfolio and continues to carry attractive yields to organically reduce asset sensitivity we have been growing fixedrate loans notably in single family yearoveryear fixedrate loans excluding ppp increased by east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 turning to slide against the backdrop of materially lower interest rates declines in earningasset yields have been partially offset by decreases in the cost of funds our average cost of deposits for the third quarter dropped to basis points down from basis points in the second quarter an improvement of basis points the spot rate of total deposits as of september was basis points our third quarter average cost of interestbearing deposits dropped to basis points down from basis points in the second quarter an improvement of basis points the spot rate of interestbearing deposits as of september was basis points in the lower left quadrant we present our third quarter cost of deposit by deposit category compared to the cost of deposits in the third quarter of which was the last full quarter under a zero interest rate policy before the fed raised rates in december at that time the average cost of deposits was basis points and the average cost of interestbearing deposits was basis points we included this chart in the deck as we believe it provides additional context of the repricing lever within our cost of deposits you can clearly see that our cd book has not fully repriced down to historic reserve levels we expect to continue to reduce our average cost of cds maturing cds over the next six months repriced lower bringing the total cost of deposits down further the rate paid on originations and renewals of domestic cds in the third quarter of was basis points and the retention rate of branch cds has been an excellent quartertodate rates paid on our cd originations and renewals have been lower than in the third quarter also as of yesterday the spot rate for our cost and interestbearing deposits is down to basis points and for our total cost of deposits its down basis points moving on to fee income on slide total noninterest income in the third quarter was million compared to million in the second quarter fee income and net gains on sales of loans was million in the third quarter down by million or quarteroverquarter lending fees of million decreased by million largely reflecting valuation changes for warrants received as part of lending relationships third quarter lending fees included million from the increase in the valuation of warrants in comparison second quarter included million from an increase in the valuation of warrants included in lending fees are customerdriven letters of credit fees valuation of warrants including in lending fees are customerdriven letters of credit fees which increased quarteroverquarter and parallel with increased customer activity reflecting an increase in the number or customer accounts and customerdriven transactions deposit account fees and wealth management fees increased quarteroverquarter foreign exchange fees decreased quarter overquarter due to downward revaluations of fxdenominated balance sheet items partially offset by an increase in customerdriven transactions moving on to slide third quarter noninterest expense was million a decrease of linked quarter excluding amortization of tax credits and other investments and core deposit intangible amortization adjusted noninterest expense was million in the third quarter an increase of only quarteroverquarter and a decrease of yearoveryear i would also note that excluding the impact of ppp loan origination costs deferred in the second quarter third quarter compensation expense of million decreased quarteroverquarter to million in the second east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 quarter in the second quarter million of the compensation expense associated with ppp loan originations was deferred the quarteroverquarter increase in computer software expense reflects amortization of previously capitalized investment spend our third quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was over the past five quarters our efficiency ratio has ranged from to as an organization we remain committed to controlling expenses across the board in order to support our strong profitability with that i will now turn the call back to dominic closing remarks dominic ng chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you irene well in summary our net interest margin is stabilizing our loan growth is positive we remain disciplined about efficiency and credit remains manageable business activity for our customers is picking up and we are looking forward to helping them rebuild and expand into the future here i would like to thank all of our associates for their dedication during these unprecedented times and wish everyone continued good health i will now open up the call to questions operator question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning ebrahim dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc if you could just start with credit dominic when we look at the provisioning level i think assuming that the macro doesnt deteriorate from here just talk to us in terms of your comfort around the portfolio well one like what do you expect with the rest of the deferrals that are still outstanding as we get towards the end of the year what percentage of those do you expect to go into nonaccrual versus go back to paying and what have you learned about the portfolio in the last six months to give us comfort that youre not going to have negative credit surprises in east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well weve been actually looking at our credit portfolio sectorbysector and within the ci also in commercial real estate in the ci with all the different industry vertical each vertical got review loanbyloan cre we break it down by if it is hotel office building multifamily and then regionbyregion and obviously our single family mortgages hardly have any problem and has always been for many years so weve done all of that kind of review and we as of today feel pretty good about where we are today we think our reserve is definitely adequate and in terms of our risk rating classification and so forth and we feel that we are very much current in terms of the classification from the deferral point of view as you can see from june to september and all the way even we showed that the deferral as of two days ago it continued to show great progress and we at this point do not see a lot of concern about surprises ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just in terms of capital i think dominic you mentioned on cet even on tangible equity you have one of the stronger capital levels you were conservative coming into the cycle not buying back stock just talk to us in terms of how you think about capital allocation maybe not in the next couple of months but as we look into the first half of next year and your i guess desire to buy back stock if it stays where it is dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well we have board meetings every months or so so this is always like i would say the outstanding agenda so we update the information financial condition and balance sheet and also mainly the economic outlook with the board members and then with those information we deliver it and then we have discussion of whether we take any kind of action so at this stage right now i would say that this and we are still in that pandemic environment we are not going to be looking into buying back stock on the other hand comes things can change dramatically in terms of the economic outlook and then we will do whatever is right accordingly based on the circumstances at that point operator our next question comes from ken zerbe with morgan stanley please go ahead kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thanks i guess maybe just looking for a little more detail on the npa increase i know you said it was driven by oil and gas i guess the concern that we would have is does it continue right i mean obviously you still have a sizable portfolio it is running off but is the worries does it continuedo you have to build reserves for the portfolio as it deteriorates thanks irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc ken thats a great question when we look at the increase in nonaccrual loans and also chargeoffs really over the course of last year and beyond that really a lot of that have come from the oil and gas portfolio and we have also increased the reserves lets say quarteroverquarter to so when i look at it from the perspective of where the loss content is i do think its still in our portfolio in oil and gas i would say though when these loans east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 were previously classified they are identified and one thing that is positive is that were not seeing ongoing kind of downward deterioration into classified assets dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah i would say ken let me just maybe add onto what irene just shared is that would there be a likelihood of more potential chargeoff losses from the oil and gas portfolio definitely there is that probability the difference is that we feel very confident because we only have so many loans in the oil and gas portfolio and its dwindling down and there are just so many loans in there and we have looked at every one of them and we continue to classify them in the right bucket and the macroeconomic condition as of today is actually more positive than a few months ago we all recall back in late march and early april the crude oil prices just dropped to a level that is unheard of but its been pretty much stabilized at that per barrel and then the gas price actually have gone up quite nicely and then keep in mind also that our portfolio has irene shared earlier i mean substantial percentage of these loans are properly hedged even going into so its not like these are the loans that on a daily basis they are going one by one going into ph double i think what we experience in terms of the chargeoffs are somewhat relative to peers in that industry and everyone get like from the oil and gas business so from our perspective is that this is a portfolio that is getting smaller and smaller and we have substantial reserve to provide for it and we feel confident that we can manage that and in addition to it we have plenty of profits and income to offset against these losses and still come up with a decent return of equity and return of assets kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah and is it a longterm plan just to keep running it off because i guess its just hard for us to see how this segment generates positive riskadjusted returns given every few years it almost feels like theres a problem and losses spike im not talking positive riskadjusted returns over like a multiyear period dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc we are managing it down and then we started managing it down last year and then we continue to manage it down but the environment keep changing who knows whats going to happen from the demand around the world or in united states or even technological advancements that change the dynamic that we have no ability to project i mean as a bank we basically facilitate financing with a very very focus of risk management if we feel that this is going to be an industry going forward that we can manage the risk very effectively there is no reason why were not into this segment i think this all get back down to we will be always very prudent to watch whats going on in the future and do the right thing accordingly operator our next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning jared dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc looking out at the expense side and the efficiency side do you think given the broader low rate environment we can get back to a sub40 efficiency ratio or will that really depend on seeing some broader rate improvement or is there anything you can do on the expense side to help accelerate that irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah jared ill take that question i think the largest variable for that would be on the revenue side as we talked about earlier in our prepared remarks we do feel strongly fourth quarter and beyond that revenue net interest margin nii will increase i think we have a long history of proven ability to control the expenses and thats something that we feel confident in this type of environment that well be able to continue to do so while still making the appropriate investments that we need to support our growing business jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then shifting a little bit to the cre portfolio and the growth you saw this quarter i guess how much of that was refiing i guess somebody elses loan and what gives you how are you getting comfort putting on new cre product now and is that translating into better terms and conditions in pricing or i guess maybe your thoughts around what youre seeing and doing on the cre side dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc in terms of with cre loans that we originated most of i mean almost all of them are with customers that weve been doing business for a long time and these are customers have very strong financial and balance sheet that we feel comfortable and then obviously these are the properties that are less impacted negatively by the pandemic and thats what we originated these new loans some of them are not refi some of them are just also taking shares from other banks and so forth the pricing is getting better slightly better than it was i would say six nine months ago obviously cre pricing was extremely competitive last year its no longer as competitive so we will be i would say that originating cre loan with a slightly better pricing going forward in terms of volume of cre loans i would think that in we probably may not have as nice of a robust growth of cre origination like we did in so you would expect that the growth rate will be tempered somewhat because of the lack of great quality asset to be financed but well continue to look and indiscernible east west is not a giant institution its not that difficult for us to keep looking and finding gems hide around the bushes and then just make up enough to show positive growth rate operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for the question i want to ask about everyones favorite topic on taxes given the markets expectation that there could be a tax rate increase next year could you walk us through the potential sensitivity on the tax line and also the amortization line given that you guys have been a little bit more proactive in managing your taxes over the years irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc chris so when we look at the changes that might happen from a corporate tax rate to of that at this point in time although there a lot of moving parts we think if that happens the impact to us will be about on the rest of it with the amortization once we have this call in january to talk about fourth quarter we can give you a little bit more details on that along with that if that happens ill add at this point in time we have about million at ddas that would reverse as well christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and then assuming this status quo just for modeling purposes i think you said for the fourth quarter amortization of million that would bring it to around million for the year all else equal is that the right math for next year tax rate and million or so on the amortization irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc well talk about that in january christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks operator our next question comes from dave rochester with compass point please go ahead david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc on credit you talked about the reserve release a bit i was just wondering if you could maybe just give a little bit more detail on your comfort level reducing that reserve on your cre book at this point were there still uncertainty in the economy and how the remaining deferrals in that book are going to pan out this quarter we saw other banks building that reserve in that particular bucket so i was just wondering what your thoughts were for this east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 quarter and then if you could talk about how much stimulus that you have baked into your outlook at this point that would be great irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc okay so if we look at kind of the breakdown of our allowance the amount of reserve that we have set aside for our new estate loans is just over million so on income producing real estate and also multifamily so ultimately i would say right now deferrals what were seeing in the portfolio our customers were very comfortable with that allowance level depending on what happens with the forecast well look and see as far as is the level appropriate for our allowance calculation we rely on moodys and the economic forecast there to kind of tailor to our portfolio we do use a multiscenario approach baseline s1 and s3 because s3 is a more severe adverse scenario overall ill share that the reserve the quantitative reserve that we set aside is higher than the baseline david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and then how much stimulus is baked into your overall outlook at this point were you guys assuming for additional government stimulus irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah so and i think ill just break it down with the scenario so baseline did assume trillion or the s3 assumed none so as i mentioned the overall quantitative reserve that we have is higher than the baseline operator our next question comes from gary tenner with da davidson please go ahead gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning a lot of questions have been answered but i was curious on your comments on prepaying the ppp i think you said if i remember the million monthtodate in terms of the liquidity facility how much of that do you expect to exit by yearend irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc so we paid off the million we all evaluate and see if as far excuse me million well evaluate and see if well pay off more i think more than the million is expected depending on how much and the timing of that well look and see as far as the liquidity that we have and then also the pace of the forgiveness of the ppp loans which has started for us gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay and then just in terms of overall balance sheet you talked about kind of holding some of that liquidity you have in anticipation of loan growth improving do you have any and also continue with your deposits even post pandemic at a good pace im just wondering what your thoughts are for expectations overall liquidity flows given the amount of excess funding in the system right now east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah i mean i think thats a great question especially in this quarter what weve done especially as deposit flow has continued i think weve gone a little bit more comfortable reinvesting some of that into securities and also with our securities book our afs securities book we have extended out the duration a little bit so i think if you look at the month of september not quartertodate and the average yields in the portfolio it is up a little bit close to if you look at duration at we were about and were at about as of operator our next question comes from matthew clark with piper sandler please go ahead matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hi good morning maybe first on special the increase in special mention i think youve touched the fact that the commercial real estate migrated a little bit can you give us some specific examples of what migrated this quarter irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah matthew when we look at kind of the migration into a special mention during the quarter it was really to a certain extent throughout the portfolio ill share regardless of whether a customer is on deferral were making sure that the grading is appropriate if necessarily we are downgrading these loans so some of the loans we downgraded were loans that were on deferral but across the board i would say in different kind of asset classes office multifamily and also retail matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just on the deferrals of ci exenergy has been fairly muted to date can you give us a sense for why that is and what your customers are saying at this point whether or not that might increase in the future irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc it doesnt look like that at this point in time i think we shared about this last quarter as well we did initially as an accommodation for our customers help them with a one month we called it a skipapay certainly i think that helped us kind of reach out and have those conversations with our customers on the ci front i think the requests and kind of conversations that weve had the requests for deferrals and the conversations weve had with our customers around our cash flows has generally been relatively positive operator our next question comes from david chiaverini with wedbush securities please go ahead david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks couple questions so first one on loan growth you hit on a couple of the categories already about cre expecting lower growth next year versus this year in single family residential you mentioned about similar trend going forward but on ci if we exclude ppp what type of growth are you expecting in that loan category east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well for we do plan to provide guidance at the next earnings release i mean at this point it will be too early for us right in the midst of this upcoming presidential election with the mystery about when the vaccine will be available all of sort of things that are happening right now i just feel that it will be much better for us to have the loan growth guidance to provide to you in january but in the meantime all i can share as of today is that in the second quarter april may and june we spent a lot of time focusing on ppp skipapayment deferral which took a lot of time number one thing is to focus on keeping our employees in great health and thank goodness as of today we do not have one employee actually went to a hospital for covid19 indiscernible and so all of us are in very good health we are going to continue to stay vigilant to keep everyone in good health so that we can take care of our customers and thats number one thing that were focusing on and then ppp kept us very busy and while were doing ppp were also looking into potential deferral and so forth some customers just get confused they dont really need they didnt need a deferral they just thought they have to get a deferral so a lot of conversation going on back then so not until sometime in the third quarter when these kind of issues all settled our frontline relationship managers and branch managers have start i mean really reaching out and then looking for new business the good news is that as we highlighted in our talk earlier that in the latter part of september we started really booking some nice ci loans and we started seeing growth in ci and actually many of these loans that we originated are brand new customers i think that to a certain degree were fortunate by being active helping our customers and even noncustomers for ppp or other type of matters that bankingrelated call some of these very good prospects to decide to move their banking relationship from ph other banks to east west so were picking up some new business so thats positive the first three weeks of october we also continue to bring in new business from other banks and that has been very very helpful for us and we hope this trend will continue now given the fact that we are still in the midst of a pandemic there are not going to be a lot of commercial business that are out there aggressively putting capital investment or growth other than the one that who happen to be in the business that the pandemic helped them for those who are in some of the traditional business the pandemic may not help them i think their utilization rate for their line of credit will probably continue to stay a little bit lower so we dont expect that many of the existing customers can have a strong push to draw down the line dramatically higher to cause a substantial growth there but we are getting new customers that supplement the growth so all in all i think at this point we feel that fourth quarter looking more positive from the ci side and by the way its not just coming from one particular industry or one particular geographic region its pretty much across the board for east west bank several industry verticals even our entertainment business are growing nicely back our digital media business are growing coming back strong and so our clean energy the project finance those type of business are all coming back stronger than before so we hope this trend will continue in but for the detail of providing some sort of a forecast for growth on the lending side indiscernible to the fourth quarter january david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 yes thats helpful thanks for that and then shifting gears to fee income you mentioned about how customer transaction activity increased in the third quarter curious as to what the outlook is for the fourth quarter of that customer transaction activity that momentum continued into the fourth quarter and we should expect either stabilization or a rebound just curious as to your thoughts there dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah as you can see the fee income side for customerrelated banking transaction type of fee income have all picked up so if you look at for example like deposit account fees that has a lot to do with this new banking relationship that i talked about earlier and some of the existing customers expanding their relationship with us that combination of two result in us generating even stronger cash management fee income keep in mind though we talked about for the last few years about investing in the internal infrastructure and product enhancement technology improvement all of those costs that we put in are generating tangible results weve built a cash management system that can not only just accommodate but actually offer great services to many of the more sophisticated largersized business who now can just comfortably move their banking relationship from large banks to east west bank because we have the capability to handle their cash management needs so that result in more fee income for us and larger dda account deposits and we see that trend as very positive that we are able to do all of that while a lot of us are still working at home under the pandemic so what were looking forward to is to continue to keep pushing and both working with existing customer expanding and deepening the banking relationship and also getting new customers from the outside so i look at from the cash management wealth management and even trade finance we have a pick up in term of business so all in all i look at it is that were just going to continue to focusing on making sure that we take good care of our clients and then hopefully well get more new business through this referral from our big clients and so forth and then one step at a time and then getting more meaningful core fee income coming to the bank in operator our next question comes from brock vandervliet with ubs please go ahead brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thanks dominic youve talked a lot in the past about the political environment or at least a bit in the past about it so obviously youve been pretty fraught between the us and china as we look at potentially a biden win how do you think this could potentially change your business dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc we always are sort of like an organization thats very nimble in terms of adjusting comfortably with whatever the political environment that is out there do recall four years ago the us government policy has been very very much wanted to bring in investments from china and also investing in china and so forth and for the last couple of years due to presidential election and then the political rhetoric had turned hostile and that have changed the dynamic dramatically and we looked at even with the trade war in place for the last few years with the tariff as you have seen so far we have such a big trade finance portfolio importexport business and then also with greater china exposure but at the end of the day we hardly have any losses east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 now the business slowed down a bit because were being more cautious temporarily and then also of course because of the pandemic actually china shut down for a few months and so that had affect the growth aspect but in terms of from a risk aspect we managed very very well and have almost no losses so with that in mind i would say that looking forward joe biden had made it very very clear about his foreign policy which is to get back instead of american go alone and against the world and americans going to work with allies and its going to take leadership back into united nation who wto et cetera and us and then get back into the front seat and i am sure when us wanted to get back into the front seat and engaging with their allies and china will be more than delighted to step back to stick a second or third or fourth seat and to collaborate with the united states for climate change and all the other activities that all the nations around the world need to work together so i would expect that if that happen theres no question whether as a republican party or a democrat at the end of the day us will compete with china economically and i think its the right thing to do to compete theres nothing wrong to compete but on the other hand i think that i have also strong confidence that theres going to be a lot more business exchange between us and china just reflect back for the last few months now while it doesnt get a whole lot of news coverage but jpmorgan citibank morgan stanley all increased their stake in their joint venture in china are taking majority ownership blackrock neuberger berman and a few others and the fund management business are getting new licenses insurance company getting new life licenses every day american express getting new license costco opening more stores starbucks opening more stores in fact us business never stopped never stopped expanding into china and the chinese government also have never stopped bringing them in and giving them even more business opportunities than have ever been given before in fact just last week a senior minister in china are talking about additional intellectual protection right for foreign direct investments in china so on a daytoday basis for people like us theyre constantly watching whats happening between us and china and actually do look at regulation instead of just mainstream media news we are seeing china making an aggressive effort to continue to open up the market letting foreign investors to take on the majority ownership or full ownership in notable different industries granting license that theyve never granted before and then changing the law of intellectual property protection and also penalizing company that ph force transfer of technology and so forth all of those things that weve been hearing many many times from the us trade representative lighthizer all of those things that weve been hearing theyre making the changes to it now theyre not broadcasting all over the world but they are making the changes and the business whether from us or from europe are directly benefiting from it so in this our position is that well most of those are irrelevant to us to a certain degree because were not going there to get some big capital investments and then get some license for certain type of new business our position is that the crossborder business is still strong and china has emerged from the pandemic back to business as usual many of my colleagues in shanghai and shenzhen they go out to movie theaters having dinner with their friends dont even have to wear a mask so im happy for them so they are doing business and we absolutely are there doing business also you look at hong kong hong kong the stock exchange is going to overpass us in terms of ipo listing because companies are all going there lining up unicorn after unicorn lining up in hong kong or in shanghai stock exchange and shenzhen stock exchange through these ipos there can be a lot more new millionaires to billionaires and they all need to make investments they all need to have their personal wealth management and east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 they are buying properties around the world us still one of the preferred places for either real estate investments or other investments so we do feel comfortable that business is going to be there so we have no ability to predict what the outcome is for the election coming on november but one way or the other one thing i can guarantee everyone east west knows how to adjust and adapt and find way to thrive under whatever circumstances brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thanks
