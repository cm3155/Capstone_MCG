limited at roughly of total loans and nearly all our ci loans also well diversified by industry slide shows the details of our commercial real estate portfolio it is important to note that east west portfolio remains welldiversified by geography and property type when comparing our portfolio to the ffiec commercial real estate concentration guidelines we have consistently been below the guideline since the end of slide provides additional detail on commercial real estate as you see the portfolio is very granular with an average loan size of million the weighted average loantovalue for the portfolio was a low fewer than of our commercial real estate loans have a loantovalue of or over in the appendix we have shared similar trends of low average loan sizes and ltvs within our office and retail commercial real estate portfolio many of our commercial real estate borrowers have had longstanding relationships with our banks and a large portion of our loans are full recourse with personal guarantees as a reminder we typically originate amortizing loans with a maturity of to years we also have low risk from nearterm maturities out of quarter end only of the income producing commercial real estate portfolio matures in the fourth quarter of and for all of on slide we provide detail on our residential mortgage portfolio which is made up largely of singlefamily mortgages and also home equity lines of credit like commercial real estate our residential mortgage portfolio is welldiversified by geography and property the average loantovalue for our residential mortgage portfolio is also quite low at with close to of our portfolio below a ltv as you can see on the slide in our distribution by geography our residential mortgage loans are overwhelmingly in footprint with the primary source of originations coming through our branch network residential mortgage has proven to be a resilient source of loan growth for us growing from the second quarter i would also like to highlight that over of our heloc commitment we are in first lien position turning to slide the asset quality of our portfolio remained broadly stable during the third quarter we recorded net chargeoffs of million or basis points an increase from net chargeoffs of basis points in the second quarter quarteroverquarter nonperforming assets as of september 30th decreased modestly to million or basis points of total assets from basis points as of june 30th east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 the criticized loan ratio increased basis points from june 30th to of loans held for investment the special mention loans ratio increased basis points quarteroverquarter to sic of loans held for investment as of september 30th and the classified loans ratio increased basis points to as credit continued to normalize the increases were driven primarily by ci as some borrowers are being impacted by higher rates and inflation there were no industry or sector trends for this increase in criticized ci loans and also no geographic trends to highlight and the slight uptick in commercial real estate criticized loans we remain vigilant and proactive in monitoring and managing our credit risk we recorded a provision for credit losses of million in the third quarter compared with million for the second quarter building the allowance for loan losses ratio basis point to turning to slide as shown on this slide all of our capital ratios expanded quarteroverquarter due to the strength of our earnings if adjustments were made for afs and htm security marks and the allowance for loan losses that is not already reflected in equity our capital ratios would still be very strong tangible common equity grew to as of september 30th quarteroverquarter our tangible book value per share increased yearoveryear tangible book value per share increased east west board of directors has declared fourth quarter dividend for the companys common stock the quarterly common stock dividend of per share will be payable on november to stockholders of record on november we currently have million of repurchase authorization that remains available for future buybacks although we did not repurchase any shares during the third quarter of as announced in our earnings release we intend to resume repurchases in the fourth quarter ill now turn the call over to chris for a more detailed discussion of the drivers of our income statement and outlook chris christopher j del moralniles chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc thank you irene and good morning to all i will start with a discussion of our deposit strength and then review the key drivers of net interest income and net interest margin slide highlights our deposit mix by segment customer type and source in the third quarter we grew both commercial and consumer deposit balances increased the number of customer accounts and reduced higher cost wholesale deposits yearoveryear we have successfully grown deposits across our client sectors our commercial deposits remain welldiversified by industry and our consumer deposits are fairly granular turning to the balance sheet on slide third quarter average loans grew sequentially driven by growth in all major categories third quarter average deposits of billion increased million or from the second quarter during the third quarter growth in average money market and time deposits was offset by declines in other deposit categories largely reflecting customers optimizing their yields in a higher interest rate environment our average loantodeposit ratio was during the third quarter and average noninterestbearing demand deposits made up of average deposits for the period turning to the nim on slide third quarter net interest income was million a new third quarter record for east west net interest margin was which compressed by basis points quarteroverquarter as you can see from the waterfall chart on this slide nim compression was largely due to the impact of higher east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 interestbearing deposit costs and the deposit mix shift to higher cost customer deposit categories partially offset by the lower wholesale deposits and higher loan volumes turning to slide the third quarter average loan yield increased by basis points quarteroverquarter and the spot coupon rate on our loans was at quarter end compared with at june 30th in total nearly of our loan portfolio was variable rate at september 30th with a fairly balanced split between prime rate and sofrlinked loans over the last several years while rates were low we continue to help many of our cre and also some ci customers hedge against the rising rate risk through the use of swaps caps and collars as a result on the customer side nearly twothirds of the total cre book was fixed rate to them at september 30th these clients are partially protected against the rising debt service costs and the payment shocks from the higher rate environment over the nearterm turning to slide our average cost of deposits for the third quarter was basis points up basis points from the second quarter our spot rate on total deposits was basis points as of september 30th reflecting a cumulative beta relative to the change in fed funds since december in comparison the cumulative beta on our loans has been over the same period we were pleased with our ability to manage deposit costs during the quarter we paid down billion of higher cost wholesale deposits and replaced much of that with lower cost customer funds moving on to noninterest income on slide total noninterest income in the quarter was million for the third quarter interest rate contracts and other derivative income of million increased million from the second quarter primarily reflecting changes in market valuations other investment income of million was down a bit quarteroverquarter reflecting higher valuation marks on cre investments recognized during the second quarter our fee income for the period was million moving on to slide third quarter noninterest expense was million a decrease quarteroverquarter excluding amortization of tax credits and cdi adjusted noninterest expense was million in the third quarter down over million or down sequentially this was driven by decreases in several categories including lower consulting costs lower loan related expense lower comp and benefits expense and lower occupancy expense the third quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was compared with in the prior quarter we are pleased with our ability to consistently deliver industry leading efficiencies and with that ill now review our updated outlook for the full year on slide for the full year we are reaffirming our prior guidance for the end of period loans net interest income adjusted noninterest expense and credit items regarding tax items we now expect our effective tax rate for the full year will be between to based on about million of tax credit investments we currently anticipate that for the fourth quarter the amortization of tax credit investments will be approximately million with that ill now turn the call back to dominic for his closing remarks dominic ng chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you chris in closing we are looking forward to finishing on a high note our revenue net interest income and profitability measures remain high the east west business model is resilient and diversified and our balance sheet has positioned us well to continue to focus on our customers i want to thank our associates for all of their hard work last quarter which was reflected in our strong performance east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 i will now open the call to questions operator question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswersession operator instructions our first question comes from casey haire with audio gap casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah yeah thanks good morning everyone and welcome back chris yeah first question for you chris just on the nii the curious about the cash position and working down those wholesale deposits going forward how much more can you lean into the cash position to retire the rest of wholesale deposits christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc sure as irene mentioned on the last call it was our intention to pay down up to billion by year end and weve obviously chopped a lot of that wood here in the third quarter with billion paid off so theres a little bit that we had planned thats maturing that were going to take care of as we go forward and then well continue to evaluate the optimal level of cash as we move into next years planning casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got it okay and just as my followup on the buyback resumption just curious how aggressive you might be with that i know you have the million authorization but are you looking to manage to a specific cet1 ratio or payout ratio just trying to get a sense of how aggressive you might be on the buyback with the stock at obviously attractive valuation dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc i dont know i will use the word aggressive i think were always opportunistic we have million left to go thats already been authorized and so i think obviously price is pretty good and so well proceed and so i will leave it at that operator our next question comes from brandon king with truist securities please go ahead brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc good morning east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc good morning brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so i wanted to get more context in regards to net interest margin trends potentially being in the higher for longer rate environment when do you think we could see some stabilization or potential bottoming christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc well i think we expect generally continued modest compression given the current rate outlook and given our expectation that theres potentially another fed action towards year end in the mediumterm of course were managing more towards dollar nii and in the long term obviously our largest risk is actually to rapidly declining rates so were taking proactive measures to make sure were positioned for the long term brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and being that next year is going to be more challenging from a revenue standpoint what are you thinking about in terms of managing or maintaining positive operating leverage in regard to expense base christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc i think its a little early for us to give you guidance we typically do that at the january call and well be happy to followup then operator our next question comes from broderick preston with ubs please go ahead broderick preston q analyst ubs securities llc im actually using my full name i like it i wanted to ask maybe a more pointed question on the buyback dominic so you got million of authorization capital is obviously robust the stock is cheap and well below where you bought it back in the past and you had million left over after paying the dividend out of net income in alone so would you consider using the full amount in the fourth quarter dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc so as i said earlier we are well we are opportunistic and so we dont really have any specific sort of like a direction that we have to be doing it in one quarter or not and well see how what the price is and how things go and one thing you can be rest assured east west bank is always shareholders friendly and we always do the right thing at the right time and whatever that makes sense that well go according to what we think is the best broderick preston q analyst ubs securities llc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 got it okay and then i did have a followup as a multipart kind of question wanted to ask how much of the banks loan portfolio was ph sncs and of that what amount is the bank the lead underwriter on and then also i dont know if chris or irene would have this do you happen to have what the reserve on the office portfolio is irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc yeah brody so as of we held billion of ph sncs that we have purchased from others as of were also the lead on million of ph sncs indication million of which we participated out to others and i think your next question although you squeezed some three questions brody i want to comment on that on office so we increased the reserve for office total reserve for office was million as of up from million as of and ill just share that half of that continues to be qualitative factors versus quantitative reserves that we need as we look at the portfolio and the economic outlook and the portfolio credit quality so we continue to monitor this and make sure that our reserve is building as we think is appropriate given the environment operator our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess maybe dominic for you so as we think about you have a lot of excess capital a lot of banking peers are pulling back just give us a sense of customer demand as we think about lending on the commercial side and how youre approaching are you pulling back in certain areas just give us a sense of the growth opportunity be it market share driven or just customer demand driven that youre seeing today dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well our priority has been mainly focusing on taking good care of our customers as you can see actually back in march some of our other former competitors were really hurting their customer in a big way so one of the things that east west offer is stability and consistency so we have frankly some really good commercial real estate clients year in and year out have been banking with us for decades that went through cycles of various economic conditions and actually have done really well in fact whenever there is a down cycle they tend to do better and when there are customers like that that find really great opportunities we step up and take good care of them and make sure they get the financing needs but were not out there chasing down every other customers who are ph fleeing other banks and east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 things like that so obviously as we all know interest rate is a relatively high level and there are not that many great deals out there and also on the ci side many of our very strong customers are not out there making substantial investments so in the standpoint of where are we today is that we got plenty of capital to be deployed we are able to continue to take very good care of our customers for their needs but on the other hand our customers are not out there making very aggressive purchases or acquisitions that require a whole lot of additional line increase and so forth so with that i think that well i would say that the growth is relatively somewhat stable and i dont expect something dramatic just because of the market disruption that happened back in march but secondly i do feel that we are getting more inquiries from customers from other banks from banks that ph failed or banks that currently are not doing well their customers are making indiscernible we are prudently taking these new customers one at a time we dont want to just quickly and then start bringing too many on and then just causing indigestion for ourselves so we are just prudently taking them on one at a time and then we feel that in the next few years in general the market is somewhat more favorable to east west simply because of the current competitive landscape ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc that is good color thanks dominic and maybe just one maybe chris for you and apologies if i missed it but the special mention loans we saw that tick up bps was bps whats driving that is it just your own internal portfolio review or are there certain areas within the commercial book where youre seeing some softness christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc ill let our chief risk officer address that one irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc thank you chris so ebrahim when we look at that honestly there really arent any drivers one way or another or sector it is really pretty broadbased as i mentioned in the prepared remarks we continue to monitor the portfolio very carefully and as appropriate given kind of where rates are we do expect that there will be some kind of increases in the classified and the criticized asset ratios given the very very low basis ph those are at i might add operator our next question comes from dave rochester with compass point please go ahead david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning everyone and irene and chris congrats on the new roles christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc thanks dave east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc thanks dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc i know you mentioned its a little early on the expense front for next year but just bigger picture is there anything we need to watch out for any big ticket items either on the regulatory side or systems upgrades or anything like that that would potentially keep that expense growth rate elevated next year irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc yeah i dont think so dave i mean obviously we have a special assessment the fdic special assessment that will impact everyone in the industry but nothing particular david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great and then as a followup on the margin first it sounded like you mentioned maybe seeing a little bit of nim pressure nearterm correct me if im wrong but you guys also highlighted a pretty big deceleration and the increase in deposit costs with the spot barely up from the quarter average so just wondering absent any fed rate changes could you actually see nim stabilize nearterm and still continue to benefit from earning assets repricing higher and are you seeing that potentially drive the nim stabilization and growth into christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc as i look to the fourth quarter i certainly see the mix should we be able to continue the deposit growth from our customer that were seeing as providing some lift to that compression risk that having been said if theres another fed hike therell probably be some repricing of existing deposits thatll work against us so those are the dynamics that are at play but i think youve captured the ph spirit of remarks well david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great thanks guys irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc maybe ill just add i mean if you look at the third quarter and the trajectory of the nim and this helps kind of inform our thoughts around this so nim for july was and then for august and september weve got a little bit of better for both quarters so months excuse me so that helps us kind of frame where were at and why were comfortable with the stabilization as we move forward operator the next question comes from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 hi good morning christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i wanted to ask about just a little bit more color on the funding side it looks like youre getting some nice loan growth and it sounds like youre going to continue to lean in here yeah i think you noted that ph marketed deposit growth this quarter is coming from money market and time deposits is that where youre going to be focused on bringing in new funding to fund the loans christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc i think were going to be looking across the board and frankly weve seen success across the board in fact on the consumer side were expecting to grow deposits driven by some initiatives we have internally with business checking accounts on small and mediumsized businesses as well as consumers as well as a further push to better integrate our new mortgage customers into our checking ecosystem so i think well see consumer lift that wont necessarily be at the higher end costs but were also expecting to grow commercial balances and as dominic alluded to there have been opportunities for us to be selective and proactive with new customers for the bank and were obviously prioritizing new customers that come with significant deposits at the right price point manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc so maybe on that dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc i also want to add that for our commercial clients new commercial clients we brought in that have primary operating accounts that transfer over to east west bank its going to take some time to set up the cash management online banking and whatnot and in order to have it fully operated its going to take a few months so therefore theres going to be a gradual increase when it comes to the noninterestbearing deposits manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay and then maybe just to focus on the cds and time deposits it looks like you are seeing some good traction there i think i can see online that youre offering about a rate i guess it is slightly below market given where other banks are can you talk about how youre able to do that is it because of the longer relationships you have with your depositors is it relationship pricing elsewhere in the services you offer christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 i think weve had success both with our ph rack rates what youre referring to and also on selected new opportunities were able to look at exceptions and opportunities to bring folks in on an individualized basis and i think thats one of the hallmarks of east west is theyre able to look at the entire relationship and make appropriate business judgments to move forward on individual opportunities and thats been part of whats given them their low cost base they have today and allowed us to continue to attract the right customers with the right relationship going forward operator our next question comes from matthew clark with piper sandler please go ahead matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hi good morning everyone first one for me just on deposit your deposit cost outlook kind of beyond the fourth quarter if the forward curve plays itself out i guess how quickly do you think you might be able to start cutting deposit costs christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc theres going to be a bit of a lag over the nearterm but as soon as the fed starts moving i think itll be a function of how fast the fed starts moving so when rates fell precipitously and rapidly in the bank reacted pretty well and obviously itll be a function of how and why the fed moves as to how well react and lag on the next turn here matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay okay and then on office cre one of your competitors had a couple of new nonperformers on the suburban side of office are you seeing any performance differences within your office portfolio as it relates to suburban versus central business district irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc yeah matthew we actually dont have much exposure at all for any kind of central business district quite honestly and you can see that reflected really with the loan sizes as far as the size of the loan if its granular or smaller theyre smaller properties so based on that i would say that most of ours is really more kind of suburban or non kind of cbd with that said i would say as we continue to indiscernible through the portfolio although there are loans that we are working out with clients overall were comfortable with the grades were comfortable with the strategy and theres no major difference that were seeing in one sector or region geographically operator our next question comes from timur braziler with wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning two big picture questions for me maybe for dominic just on the timing of the buyback i mean how much of that is symbolic in nature its a question that it seems like you get every single conference east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 call and im just wondering announcing it here how much does that speak to your confidence in navigating the current credit cycle dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc i dont quite irene and chris did you hear the question i didnt quite exactly heard it clear irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc yeah maybe ill start to answer your question look i mean i think as we look at the uses of capital highest indiscernible of capital also the growth of the capital the confidence that we have the capital will continue to grow not just quarterbyquarter but if we look multiyear this is part of our process and quite candidly just where the capital levels are at so i think in answer to your question yes we do think it is a commentary on kind of the strength of where we see the franchise is and what will happen with our capital levels timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats great and then maybe just talk to the recent management changes and how that relates to your thinking on succession planning dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc in fact i think this is always at east west banks sort of like longterm plan leadership development succession planning and we are very pleased in fact that were able to get chris to join us in the cfo position and which allow us to get irene to rotate to a very important position to be our chief risk officer we feel that as our organization continue to grow its going to be very important for us to make sure that we have very very solid and strong leadership both in the finance area and also in the risk area we cant think of any better person that can fill that chief risk officer job going forward than irene and also thank goodness chris came in and shortly and act like hes been moonlighting at east west for years so this has been all working out pretty good for us because i think we strengthened our executive leadership desk at east west and this is going to be pretty good for us for many years to go operator our next question comes from gary tenner with da davidson please go ahead gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc good morning gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 as it relates chris to your comments about kind of planning longerterm wondering if there are any additions to the interest rate swap book which i think was billion as of june just a quick math looks like the headwind there was maybe million or million higher quarteroverquarter versus the second quarter so thinking about how to view that going forward christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc sure yeah we did add a total of million for the quarter million of which irene had mentioned on the last earnings call another million came after that and weve done a further million just for transparency here in the fourth quarter irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc indiscernible christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah with a forward start so were looking at essentially protecting against that downside risk as the previous call alluded to indiscernible the fed moves precipitously downward were sort of protecting ourselves against that profile the total cost collectively of all of the swaps for the quarter was million which is to say our income would have been million higher had we not put those in place but we think thats prudent and appropriate protection going forward thats costing us currently or cost us in the quarter basis points to the nim but we think thats a reasonable price to pay for that longterm insurance that were putting in place gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co all right i appreciate that and just remind me in your loan your slide that shows fixed in hybrid and fixed is that adjusted for the swaps or adjusted is a little over irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc it is not adjusted christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah the slide numbers are the actual underlying loans and the swaps are an overlay to that and again keep in mind that some of the swaps that irene mentioned the more recent ones have all been forward starting so theres a bit of a lag there before theyll take effect but theres obviously a component operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 great maybe for the team you talked about capital ph use of capital a lot the buybacks seemingly i think the market likes that what about an appetite to reposition a portion of the bond portfolio given the move in rates christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc chris i think were always looking at the right portfolio strategies and i think were going to be looking at our cash positions our portfolio strategies and our growth dynamics as we look here at the fourth quarter going into planning for next year and well take all of that into consideration and i think as dominic has said were shareholder friendly well do the right thing but well be very thoughtful about what that right thing should be christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks chris and then a lot of questions about office and maybe by the market but dominic do you think thats where the we should be focusing i mean weve seen some ci credits from some of your peers go sideways this quarter i guess if you were to kind of stack rank where youre most worried about credit going into next year like what would you say dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc right now im not too concerned about much anything frankly from a credit perspective we actually are in pretty good shape i mean we do have a slight ph tick up in terms of chargeoff but it doesnt really compare indiscernible i mean almost like a no chargeoff at all for the last two quarters so i think that we just kind of normalize at this point at this stage i agree i mean if i look at the overall credit portfolio i really havent seen much that i would say really got me concerned i mean i would reflect back five years ago six years ago i mean this oil and gas portfolio that we had was not very good and so we had a little bit of chargeoff but the nice thing about having a very diverse portfolio that we have is that despite the fact that we have some challenges with our oil and gas portfolio the fact is ph we still are making record earnings simply because everything else are doing so well so that one particular industry couldnt hurt us much so when i look at cre right now our office building a lot of people have their eyes on it and im pretty sure at some point we may take a hit here and there its just that the overall portfolio is not big enough the size of this portfolio the size of loans the average size as you can see is so small and our ltv is so low and so therefore at the end of the day and the earnings for everything else is so high and i think that allinall we should be in great shape so at this stage right now im still not concerned and i would tell you though i always expect that by the second quarter to third quarter well be going through recession thats what i expected a year a yearandahalf ago it didnt turn out and would it be like six months from now or is that actually were exactly in a soft landing who knows but the way i looked at it is that doesnt really matter whether its a recession or a soft landing our position is that east west will continue to stay true to our philosophy which is having a very diverse portfolio and having a strong customer base and this is how we mature at the end of the day relatively speaking we always end up doing better ph than the other banks east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to dominic ng for any
