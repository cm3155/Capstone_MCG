executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thanks dominic ill start with our asset quality metrics on slide overall our key asset quality metrics continue to improve quarteroverquarter total criticized loans were down sequentially by to billion or of total loans as of september yeartodate criticized loans decreased by and the criticized loan ratio improved by basis points from of loans as of december quarteroverquarter nonperforming assets were down by to million or basis points of total assets as of september yeartodate nonperforming assets decreased by and the nonperforming asset ratio improved by basis points from basis points of assets the third quarter improvement in nonperforming assets was largely driven by commercial real estate and oil and gas resolutions our oil and gas loan portfolio has continued to decrease and commitments are now below billion as discussed previously our goal was to reduce commitments to this level this is about the right size for us on slide we present the components of our allowance for loan losses our allowance totaled million as of september of loans excluding ppp compared with million or as of june the quarteroverquarter reduction in the allowance largely reflects an improved macroeconomic forecast net charge offs were essentially unchanged at million in the third quarter compared with million in the second quarter the net chargeoff ratio was basis points of average loans annualized for both the third and second quarters during the third quarter we recorded a negative million provision for the credit losses compared with a negative million provision in the second quarter currently we expect to record a negative provision of approximately million for the fourth quarter similar to this quarter and now moving on to a discussion of our income statement on slide this slide summarizes the key line items of the income statement which ill discuss in more detail on the following slides ph in noninterest income included in interest rate contrast and other derivatives are marktomarket adjustments which were a positive million in the third quarter compared with a million loss in the second quarter these primarily relate to changes in the credit valuation adjustment on this slide the cba marks are included under the other line of noninterest income amortization of tax credits and other investments increased this quarter to million compared with million in the second quarter reflecting the impact of investments that closed during the third quarter for the fourth quarter we anticipate that the amortization of tax credits and other investments will be approximately million the third quarter income tax expense was million and the effective tax rate was the yeartodate effective tax rate for the first nine months of was and we expect that the full year effective tax rate will be approximately east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 ill now review the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin on slides through starting with the average balance sheet third quarter average loans of billion grew by million or linked quarter annualized and by billion or annualized excluding ppp million of our ppp loans were forgiven by the sba during the third quarter third quarter average deposits of billion were up by billion or linked quarter annualized led by growth in noninterestbearing demand deposits which increased by billion with a strong deposit growth our average loantodeposit ratio was in the third quarter down from in the second quarter average earning assets growth in the third quarter reflected the strong deposit growth on an average basis interest bearing cash and deposits with banks grew billion securities increased by million and repurchase agreements increased by million turning to slide third quarter net interest income of million was the highest quarterly net interest income in the history of east west growing by linked quarter annualized income related to ppp loans was million in the third quarter consisting of million of deferred fees and million of interest income as of september we have million of ppp deferred loan fees remaining to accrete quarteroverquarter the gaap net interest margin contracted to in the third quarter a decrease of basis points from the prior quarter excluding ppp the third quarter adjusted net interest margin of contracted by basis points sequentially as you can see from the waterfall chart on this slide the variability of our net interest margin comes from excess liquidity the quarteroverquarter decrease in the net interest margin for the third quarter was largely driven by the increase in average cash and interestbearing deposits with banks due to the strong average deposit growth the impact of this was a negative basis points to the margin the margin headwind from incremental lower asset yields was offset by a lower cost of interest bearing funds and a higher share of ph dda balance non interestbearing dda in the deposit mix quarteroverquarter our robust net interest income growth came from loan growth and incremental purchases of securities and repo agreements and for the full year we expect nii growth of to excluding the impact of ppp turning to slide the third quarter average loan yield was million and excluding the impact of ppp the adjusted loan yield was down by basis points from in the second quarter of turning to slide our average cost of deposits for the third quarter dropped to basis points an improvement of basis points from the second quarter the spot rate on total deposits was basis points as of september also down by basis points from june our cost of deposits declined as maturing higher rate cds repriced to current market rates and we lowered the rates paid on other accounts the average cost of cds in the third quarter was basis points a drop of basis points from the second quarter in the third quarter we originated or renewed billion of domestic cds at a blended rate of basis points and weighted average duration of four months over the course of many of the higher price cds have already repriced down in the fourth quarter we have billion of domestic cds maturing at a blended rate of basis points of which million have originated when deposit rates were higher at a blended rate of basis points moving on to fee income on slide total noninterest income in the third quarter was million an increase from million in the second quarter customerdriven fee income and net gains on sales of loans was million essentially flat compared with the second quarter and up yearoveryear quarteroverquarter east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 growth in deposit account fees and interest rate swap revenue and sba loan sale gains were offset by decreases in lending fees and in wealth management yearoveryear the growth in fee income reflects new customer acquisition particularly for gts and fx beyond rebound from covid related troughs beyond quartertoquarter volatility we are positive about the yearoveryear trends in fee income and momentum for future growth moving on to slide third quarter noninterest expense was million excluding amortization of tax credits and other investments ph and quite a positive tangible amortization adjusted noninterest expense was million in the third quarter an increase of million or sequentially the largest quarteroverquarter change was in other operating expenses which increased largely due to higher loan related expenses and charitable contributions the third quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was compared with in the second quarter while achieving industryleading efficiency we continue to make investments in people and technology to expand our banking capabilities and product offerings with that ill now review our updated full year outlook for on slide weve updated our full year outlook relative to a quarter ph to go for the full year of compared with our full year results we expect yearoveryear loan growth excluding ppp in the range of to up from the prior range of to yearoveryear adjusted net interest income growth excluding ppp in the range of to unchanged from our prior outlook our increased loan growth outlook is a good foundation for robust net interest growth net interest income growth in even though it does not materially shift the full year growth outlook adjusted noninterest expense growth excluding tax credit amortization of unchanged from our prior outlook based on our macroeconomic forecasts and loan growth outlook at this point we expect to book a negative provision for credit losses of million in the fourth quarter similar to what we recorded in the third quarter this is a change from our prior outlook of zero provision expense in the second half of the year we currently expect that the full year effective tax rate will be approximately excluding the impact of tax credit investments we also anticipate that the amortization of tax credits and other investments will be approximately million for the fourth quarter this is an update from our prior outlook of a full year tax rate with that ill now turn the call back over to dominic for closing remarks dominic ng chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you irene in closing this was another quarter of outstanding results for east west and we expect a strong finish to i will now open up the call to questions operator east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and the first question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc hey ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess dominic you mentioned your expectations for strong loan growth into driven by ci just talk to us i mean you had pretty strong growth even this year you revised guidance for the last three quarters as we think about why loan growth probably is not going to be somewhere in the midteens range just give us a sense of like what could be the risk to that level of growth next year given the rest of the industry is talking pretty positively about a pickup in loan demand and activity levels dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well i mean at this point we see that the trajectory is for will be somewhat similar to what were currently experiencing its too early of a stage right now for us to provide guidance for we always provide our guidance in our january fourth quarter call so but so far if i look at the pipeline in the fourth quarter things are going pretty good i mean particularly in the ci sector that we feel that we will be able to continue to have that kind of growth based on what we share in our guidance to end the year at to annualized growth ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just tied to that you mentioned the loans in the china sub up from billion to billion just remind us in terms of the strategy there are there things that youre doing a bit differently today versus two or three years ago that could lead to a lot more growth contribution from the china sub over the next year and going forward dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc in terms of china our in fact i would say that overall east west bridge banking strategy we pride ourselves to be the financial bridge between the east and the west and weve always looked at our value proposition comes east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 from our knowledge and expertise of knowing the regulatory change in both us and china and because of that we can help business like chinese business to do business more effectively in united states and vice versa so we actually are able to in fact for the last months i would say that we benefited tremendously from continuing to build new business in us that have crossborder banking needs you see that in our ci loan growth you see that in our some of our cre loan growth and absolutely so in fx and treasury management fee income growth so the crossborder banking business has helped us tremendously in the united states now the china part and hong kong both hong kong and mainland china our strategy have always been that because we have the knowledge because we also have the presence that will continue to feed good high quality crossborder business in us that is the main part now but in the meantime obviously we are still growing in china what youve noticed is that the percentage growth of loans in china may be higher than us because the base is smaller keep in mind that we only i mean the billion is only of our total loan so if next year theyll grow in a percentage within their own region by lets say of that its not something thats surprising at all its something thats just given simply because that the base is so low well were not were going to be comfortable to let it grow to whatever the size it should be based on the needs but the most important thing is that we are looking at high quality asset growth and clients that is core and they have business that is expandable sustainable and profitable and because the base is small so we got plenty of room so but were not out there trying to aggressively grow the china portfolio just to make sure that even now the percentage or anything like that is all based on what are the good clients that we can actually do banking with and when we find one well work with them and thats pretty much ph to our philosophy and so far weve been benefiting tremendously particularly in us of these crossborder banking business ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood thanks for that dominic thank you dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you operator the next question comes from ken zerbe with morgan stanley please go ahead ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thanks i guess two questions so first of all could you just help us think about how to model out the credit valuation adjustment in industry contract line i mean obviously it was great this quarter but just want to understand the sustainability thanks irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah i mean i think the cba adjustment is really a function of kind of assumptions around kind of the credit component of it but also largely whats happening with rates the tenure swap rate in particular so honestly i think its hard to model that pointtopoint in particular but i think if you follow as far as whats happening with the east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 tenure thats probably the largest indicator thats helpful ken in trying to understand what that ph mark is going to be quarteroverquarter ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it understood okay and then just as a second question your noninterestbearing deposit growth has just been outstanding i think it was up over sequentially this quarter can you just talk about whats driving that growth thanks irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah were delighted with the growth that we have had in deposits across the board if you look at it from our retail branches consumer accounts a number of accounts have increased the customers have increased small business weve been very successful with kind of promotions and then also product packages that weve created that really meet the needs of our small business customers i think with that probably from a dollar perspective the largest growth has come in us domestic corporate commercial accounts and weve been very excited from the perspective of the investments that weve made the last several years for gts products capabilities and people really be able to utilize that and help our customers so the long and short of it is were very excited about the growth the customers that weve on boarded and we think that that is something that can continue realistically i would say ken though there is a certain amount of with kind of the stimulus the kind of the monetary policies there is a certain amount of excess deposits in the system and were realistic about that as well but overall i think the trends are very positive and we think that we can continue this deposit growth momentum ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you operator the next question comes from dave rochester with compass point please go ahead david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc back on the deposit commentary that all sounded great i was just curious if you think that momentum can effectively cover loan growth that you guys are expecting next year do you think you can fund that loan growth with deposit growth east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well we are currently at loan to deposit ratio so weve got a lot of cushion there right so david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc and its something that i think that is still the loantodeposit cushion that obviously causing some of the margin pressure but obviously we have such a strong net interest income growth that our volume will overcome this margin compression the way i looked at it is that we got plenty of room so that would not be a concern for us for now and we still expect continued deposit growth simply because well continue to bring in new clients i look at the pipeline well ci there are going to be new clients that well be booking when they come in that we provide a loan commitment to them ph it comes with operating accounts and then excess liquidity for money market account and so so now i do wanted to mention that it is indeed back in in the second half of last year that due to ppp we just did quite a tremendously great job and generated a lot of goodwill and brought in a lot of new clients and we were able to benefit from that and book a lot of new customers and still continue to through that goodwill and get new clients referral so i would expect that in maybe in maybe that new clients acquisition may not necessarily be as strong as the last year yearandahalf or so simply because it is somewhat unusual in for that ppp situation but ph these goodwill sometimes you have one customer has got happy theyll tell five of their friends and then well continue to pick up business this will be something that i would expect that maybe is going to continue on for the next several years but in terms of the velocity of growth may not necessarily be as strong from these deposit sort of commercial deposit side david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah yeah that will make sense good and maybe just for my followup switching to fees you mentioned seeing a lot of momentum there for future growth was just wondering youve got a lot of contributing lines here where do you expect to see the strongest growth and i know its probably difficult but how are you thinking about the pace of that growth going forward dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc i think that for we you if you looked at these different line items like foreign exchange and the cash management and treasury management the from the deposit side these are the areas that we have a tremendous growth because as we just mentioned about two things one is that the domestic commercial small middlesized business that are moving their banking relationship over to east west that generate a lot of fee income in our treasury management line item the other one crossborder business that i mentioned earlier will pick up a lot of new crossborder clients again foreign exchange fees and also treasury management area that those are the two that i would say that pretty much in addition to i mentioned about ppp and in terms of the china situation actually more us bank may not be as excited about working with chinese subsidiary company in united states that we end up benefiting from it we also have a situation of internal technology improvement as east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 we talked about the last two or three years we have continued to invest in upgrading our technology platform our system and our product offerings so these product offerings particularly in the treasury management area have put us in a position that we have the ability to service much larger commercial clients with more complexity in terms of their cash management needs so all of that have resulted in us having these kind of growth now we think they will continue but in terms of the pace volume and so forth we will i think that we will need to take a look i mean at this point my sense is that if we do not continue to innovate and continue to provide come up with new products well probably slow down but east west doesnt stop ph working and then just sit and wait for all the business to come in well continue in to develop new product capability and looking to even newer geographic areas and start identifying new prospect and through that well continue to upgrade our system too and provide even better products and through that hopefully well continue to maintain some sort of momentum going forward david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great appreciate all the color there thanks operator the next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning thank you irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess shifting back to the growth outlook and the optimism there can you break down the difference between i guess your expectation that customers increased their own optimism and the utilization rate starts turning back to normal versus the success youve had with acquiring new customers are you expecting that sees a normalization of utilization rate and i guess if not whats holding those customers back dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well i think that utilization rate would have a lot to do with how the us economy is going to be like in as we shared with you at our remarks that in fact the utilization rate amount of ci dropped from ph to just slightly but if you look at the loan growth our ci loan balance growth was annualized but then our commitment growth was higher was it or something around that range so we actually brought in more customers that we booked more new loans just that havent been funded yet what i looked at in i would expect that our customer will actually increase the utilization but while i would expect that even four or five months ago it didnt happen it just keeps coming down so its just a matter of time its a matter of time i mean something that i wish i had a crystal ball to predict what the economy is going to be like to give our clients the confidence to start drawing up the line but as of today overall amount a welldiversified portfolio with east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 many different industries somehow it averaged out to more or less the same and well see what its going to be like in its just like interest rate you know every year we wait for a little bit of a hike it hadnt happened but eventually at some point it will happen so i would expect that the utilization rate also at some point is going to start rising jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and just my followup capital continues to grow when you look at the dividend payout ratio its under you have the buyback authorization out there what are your thoughts on capital management more broadly and then the buyback more specifically now that the worst of the covid fears are behind us irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah first and foremost our focus on returning the capital to shareholders is the form of strong organic growth and being able to utilize that in the most optimal way we do have the authorization outstanding its been a while so honestly at this point wed go back to the board with any actions that we would take and thats not something that were evaluating at this point in time quite frankly because of the growth that we have and the optimism we have on the dividend side generally speaking on an annual basis ph thats through discussion with the board we evaluate and we want to make sure that the dividends payout ratio and the yield are appropriate especially relative to our expectations about the utilization of capital and then also relative to other peers jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc youre welcome operator the next question comes from brandon king with truist please go ahead brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning julianna balicka a directorinvestor relations corporate finance east west bancorp inc good morning brandon king q analyst truist securities inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 so cre growth you mentioned industrial and multifamily being the sources of that why it was a little slower than what was the level of paydowns in the quarter compared to last quarter and how do you see that shaping out in irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc generally we expect that cre is top i think on the pricing we see that as far as a lot of competition and so our overall focus has been clients where maybe were not just competing on price and structure overall as we look at the pipeline and what we expect brandon we do think fourth quarter is going to be a little better than third quarter and then also at this point in time given the visibility that we have we also think that the payoffs will decline slightly brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and resi mortgage was once again strong in this quarter could you just remind us what was the purchase and refinance mix in volumes and is a certain regions performing better than others when it comes to residential mortgage i know a lot of banks are experiencing more of normalization as far as origination volumes irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah brandon i dont have those exact stats but generally speaking at this point in time most of the loans that were originating are refinancing are purchase excuse me versus refinance that change thats happened for a period of time and for us i think in the markets that were in and the markets that we have strong branch presence as you know most of these are referrals that come in through our branch network our the volume of origination is predominantly in areas where we have lots of branches you know california southern california and northern california and then also new york metro brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and lastly with the provision guidance with another negative provision expected in by just rough assumes with a chargeoffs level of around i guess like second quarter it looks like the loan loss reserve could be around million or a little bit below million is that kind of a trough level based on your outlook now or could that go even lower in irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah you know thats a great question as you know the allowance calculation is largely driven on the macroeconomic outlook of course i think as we look at it and part of the reason i think where we felt that the negative part of it is driven by the macroeconomic outlook and as that improves i think thats why ultimately we had to book the negative provision on a goforward basis ill say that that continues to drive it i think as a trough perspective and your numbers or not you know i think thats not complex math there are about million or so that is something i think thats within the realm of possibility in the fourth quarter and then if we look at depending on the macroeconomic forecast depending on what were seeing in the portfolio i do think that number could come down from that level operator the next question comes from brock vandervliet with ubs please go ahead east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for the question just following up on the resi question if i got the number correctly it sounded like your originations there were up about billion from a year ago that seems really strong im wondering if thats im just wondering whats driving that because were really not seeing that across the board where yearoveryear increases are much closer to flat dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc are you talking about yeartodate or youre talking about just the quarter irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yearoveryear brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc yearoveryear i thought the number was ph dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc oh yearoveryear oh okay and so sorry can you repeat that question so youre just saying that for yearto date origination is about billion above last year that youre wondering why it is so strong brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc yeah exactly yeah it just seems very outsized so i was just wondering what was driving that irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah so we have a very unique product right most of what were originating is a reduced stock but high down payment singlefamily and heloc product and i think for our customer base this is something thats very attractive for them dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yes well because i think you are looking at the combination of both irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah singlefamily dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 purchase refi and heloc right and we have done i mean really well actually not just for the last months we have consistently done well with residential mortgage i would say for the last three or four years now granted everyone in the banking industry that in the mortgages business have done well because the rates have come down and which benefit people to think about refinancing and with covid more people are purchasing homes and so to that extent our customers are no different than the market the only difference that our customers tend to pay anywhere or more down payment but beyond that i mean the other characteristics is more or less the same because the overall market has been really strong and there is a lot of purchase and refi going on brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and as a followup it looked like you got comfortable in terms of where rates were deploying pretty aggressively into investment securities in the quarter any sense of where cash levels could end the year irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc no thats a hard question to answer i can talk about what we did and the deliberate actions we took in the third quarter overall in the third quarter we knew that wed have about billion of securities that were called and matured that weve deployed some of that also the ongoing analysis of cash and the deposit levels that we had and then additionally as we said before in our prepared remarks we had million of ppp loans that we deployed that cash as well so we took all this into consideration generally speaking of the securities that we did purchase we wanted to be mindful with the duration which was a little bit lower than the existing duration as of million of the portfolio but just keeping in mind being able to kind of redeploy our excess cash into earning assets but maintaining kind of the duration that we think is appropriate given kind of where interest rates are going now thats been our focus that weve had in the fourth quarter depending on the cash activity that we have the excess liquidity certainly this is something that were evaluating as well but whats really not extending the duration out further operator the next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning theres been a lot of discussion on quarterly calls this earnings season about inflation and costs im interested you guys have done a really nice job over the years to keep costs contained and have operating leverage but im wondering the ability to hold that into the year end and into next year thanks east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 21oct2021 dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well we didnt hold back much we have a growth in expenses which somewhat painful in my view but then we need to spend what we need to spend that is that investing into the system continue to improve our product capability and most importantly pay our people and recruiting both new talents and then promoting talents within and those are the things that weve been doing year in and year out and well continue to do in frankly if you recall we used to have you know maybe to type of yeartoyear expenses increase and then we ratcheted up to and then and the guidance and so those are kind of things that we because of in anticipation of inflations out there that we would need to spend what its appropriate and then it also depends on how the economy goes and the business go and then we will continue to spend prudently if we continue to grow even stronger that require more manpower were not going to shy away from increasing the expenses to support the business because the revenue will always take care of itself so i always looked at it is that i wouldnt be too focus on the expense can only go up by a certain percentage because well spend prudently and wisely and whatever we spend is going to add into more profit more revenues and more profitability and then allow us to have more sustainable growth and that pretty much is the philosophy at east west bank christopher

sheet irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc im sorry could you repeat the question that came in loud clark wright q analyst da davidson companies oh came in im sorry about that i would just essentially i was just looking at your thoughts on deposit duration and how its impacting your liquidity deployment strategy julianna balicka a directorinvestor relations corporate finance east west bancorp inc so clark this is julianna filling in for irene we will repeat the same pattern in terms of our modeling of deposit duration we take a look at the expected life of the deposit in terms of our modeling for cash deployment so for example our customers with a long history with us multiple years we have an expectation of our lifetime of say their demand deposit customers with demand deposit due to you know say an ipo or some other corporate action those are a shorter duration life expected life of deposit so we model that in as well in terms of our forecasting of the cash balances at the organization and then attributing a ability to redeploy that into whatever is the appropriate earning asset irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc and okay ill just add thanks julianna for filling in that overall as we talked about before weve seen great growth in commercial deposits operating accounts whether for small business or for larger companies those are long duration assets i think with that as with part of our analysis we also look at what kind of surge deposits they are and certainly as julianna noted some of those we will evaluate and look at it and expect a shorter life but overall relative to where we were before before these last couple of years before kind of and the changes that weve been able to make in our deposit base over the last few years id say that deposit duration is something that has certainly improved east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings
