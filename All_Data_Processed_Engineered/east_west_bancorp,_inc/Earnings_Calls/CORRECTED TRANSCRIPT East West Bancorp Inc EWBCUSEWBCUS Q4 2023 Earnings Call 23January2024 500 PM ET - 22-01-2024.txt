for our yearend earnings call was another recordbreaking year for east west our highlights include new record levels for revenue net interest income net income loans and deposits our results speak to the resilience of our business model the loyalty of our customers and the persistence of our bankers despite the turbulence in the earlier half of the year we grew customer deposits by billion in each of the past two quarters we did this by adding new deposit accounts over the past year both consumer and commercial and driving our more granular deposit base our loan growth was driven by our differentiated residential mortgage product and the strength of our commercial lending relationships asset quality remained strong and we continue to proactively manage our credit risk our annual net chargeoffs to average loans were just basis points and nonperforming assets to total asset ratio was just basis points at year end we continue to deliver industryleading efficiency supported by our simple proven business model and effective branch network our efforts drove a adjusted return on average tangible common equity and a return on average assets in looking forward we remain focused on driving core deposit growth and we are pleased by the early progress on continued net new customers and balances as we begin we have started the new year from a position of east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 strength given our earnings ability solid credit performance and strong capital levels i am pleased to announce that our board of directors has approved a increase to the quarterly common stock dividend to per share i will now turn the call over to chris to provide more details on our fourth quarter financial performance chris christopher j del moralniles chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc thank you dominic our fourth quarter net income was million excluding the onetime fdic charge and securities gains our  adjusted eps was million turning to loans on slide east west grew total average loans by for the year reflecting the strength and scale of our core residential mortgage and commercial real estate platforms we note that over the last five years east west has grown loans at a very healthy compounded annual growth rate demand for residential mortgage remained quite strong despite the generally rising rate environment we originated billion of lowrisk lowltv mortgages in and while we expect growth to moderate from q4s trend our pipelines remain resilient going into the first quarter of average cre balances grew in as we continued to work with longstanding relationship clients we saw solid increases in both multifamily and industrial property lending while office loans declined looking at the  end of period balances our fourth quarter growth was driven by an uptick in ci utilization and continued solid residential mortgage originations looking forward assuming the economy moderates into a soft landing we expect overall loan demand to moderate as well we expect our growth will continue to be driven by strong residential mortgage activity and continued growth in ci lending leading to a further and better diversified loan portfolio moving on to deposits we note that over the last five years east west has grown deposits faster than loans overall despite volatility in the first half of east west continued to grow average deposits yearoveryear we continue to show deposit momentum in the fourth quarter by adding another billion in deposit balances our growth reflects the focus and dedication of our bankers and the loyalty and resilience of our broadbased customers looking forward we will continue to focus on adding granular lowcost consumer and business deposits while continuing to reduce our use of noncore brokered or wholesale funding turning to net interest income and margin on slide  dollar net interest income increased by to million from third quarter we held our net interest margin stable at while our billion of cash flow hedges continued to be a net drag on nii in  on a marktomarket basis some of these forwardlooking hedges are now in the money and expected rate cuts will only make that better while these hedges cost us approximately million of nii in the fourth quarter theyre expected to provide valuable earnings protection as rates decline given the current forward curve and consensus economic outlook we expect nim to decline by basis points to basis points in  as deposit costs continue to normalize and new asset yields continue to flatten out we then expect our margin to be further compressed in  and  as a result of the expected rates moving lower nim likely troughed in  and we expect this to begin to rebound thereafter as assets grow expected east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 lower funding costs kick in and the expected positive cash flow benefits from our balance sheet hedges begin to offset lower asset yields speaking of asset yield please turn to slide our expectation for margin resilience is also supported by the enhanced levels of fixed rate assets in our portfolio at year end fixed rate and hybrid loans in their fixed period represented of our loan portfolio at year end versus at the beginning of turning to funding cost on slide our average cost of deposits for the fourth quarter was basis points up basis points from the third quarter as dominic previously mentioned we remain laserfocused on driving core deposit growth and growing net new customers and balances as we begin looking forward we are optimistic about our operational ability to rapidly reprice nontime deposits in a falling rate environment moving on to fees and noninterest income east west has grown fee income at a annual rate over the past five years fee income growth reflects a continuing strength in our customer derivatives business lending fees and foreign exchange income we note that  saw growth in every fee category moving on to slide total annual adjusted noninterest expense trends are on the left adjusted noninterest expense has grown annually over the past four years compared with our annual revenue growth east west consistently delivers industryleading efficiency the fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was compared with in the prior quarter adjusted noninterest expense was million in the fourth quarter comp and benefits did increase million reflecting higher commissions and incentive accruals and other operating expenses did increase million reflecting some increased legal expense realized credit card fraud losses and some advertising expense looking forward we expect adjusted noninterest expense to increase in the range of to yearoveryear driven primarily by comp and benefits and partially offset by lower deposit account expense as earnings credit and related ratedriven expense pressure begins to ease in a lower rate environment i will now turn the call over to irene for discussion of our asset quality and capital position irene irene h oh executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc thank you chris and good afternoon to all on the call as you can see on slide the asset quality of our portfolio remains broadly stable during the fourth quarter we recorded net chargeoffs of million or basis points a basis point increase from the third quarter quarteroverquarter nonperforming assets as of december increased modestly by basis point to basis points of total assets the criticized loan ratio decreased basis points from september to of loans held for investment the special mention loans ratio decreased basis points quarteroverquarter to basis points of total loans held for investment as of december and the classified loans ratio increased basis points to onetenth as credit continued to normalize we remain vigilant and proactive in managing our credit risks we recorded a provision for credit losses of million in the fourth quarter compared with million for the third quarter turning to slide the allowance for loan losses increased million quarteroverquarter primarily reflecting net loan growth the allowance for ci loans increased million the allowance for commercial real estate loans east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 increased million and the allowance for resi mortgage and consumer remained unchanged from the prior quarter the reserve for office loans increased by million to basis points of total office loans we believe we are adequately reserved for the content of our loan portfolio given the current economic outlook turning to slide as shown on this slide all of our capital ratios expanded quarteroverquarter due to the strength of our earnings east west cet1 capital ratio stands at a robust while the tangible common equity ratio grew basis points to these capital levels place us among the most wellcapitalized banks in the industry east wests board of directors has declared first quarter dividends for the companys common stock resulting in a increase in the dividend the quarterly common stock dividend of per share will be payable on february to stockholders of record on february east west repurchased million shares of common stock during the fourth quarter of for million we currently have million of repurchase authorization that remained available for future buybacks ill now turn it over to chris to share our outlook for the full year christopher j del moralniles chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc thank you irene to summarize as stated on slide our full year outlook assumes a softening economy with a more modest growth profile in and takes into consideration the yearend forward curve with cuts assumed to begin in the second quarter we expect end of period loan growth in this environment to be in the range of to driven by moderating demand but duly by a relative strength in our residential mortgage and ci lending activity we expect net interest income to decline in the range of to driven by the expected rate cuts adjusted noninterest expense is expected to increase in the range of to driven again primarily by comp and benefits and partially offset by lower deposit related expenses first quarter net chargeoff levels are expected to be in line with the fourth quarter of with subsequent quarters increasing modestly as we expect full year net chargeoffs will fall within the range of basis points to basis points we expect our effective tax rate will increase modestly for the full year with that recap now let me turn the call back to dominic for his closing remarks dominic ng chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you chris lets go to slide as i look back im very proud of our strong performance in marked by growth in tangible book value per share yearoveryear and by recognition from sp global forbes and bank director as a top performing american bank i also would like to thank our associates for their unwavering dedication to our clients as chris mentioned economists are projecting a softening economy and a declining rate environment in but at east west our goals remain the same which are to help our commercial clients thrive to meet the savings and investment needs of our branch customers and to operate with strong capital and prudent risk management allowing us to deliver toptier returns to our shareholders in any environment east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 i will now open the call to questions operator question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question comes from ebrahim h poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america securitiesmerrill lynch thank you and good afternoon dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good afternoon ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america securitiesmerrill lynch i guess maybe first question hey dominic maybe first question for chris just around the nii outlook and the sensitivity to the rate cut so it seems like the down to assumes the six rate cuts that were there in the forward curve give us a sense of what if we get zero rate cuts or just get three rate cuts should we assume proportionately nii holds up a lot better and if we dont get rate cuts in through until maybe even may are you doing taking further actions to kind of neutralizing the balance sheet christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yes yes and yes so yes if there are not as many rate cuts as were projected at year end nii will do better yes if rate cuts start later nii will do better and yes we are proactively taking a number of steps to make sure we manage our sensitivity to rates but in particular our focus on deposits is one that we think will yield us some benefit as we move through the course of the year ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america securitiesmerrill lynch noted and i guess maybe another question dominic for you so you managed through last year very strong results you have solid capital levels it feels like theres a fair amount of disruption just across the banking sector maybe in terms of people moving loan portfolios maybe banks up for sale just give us a sense in terms of when youre looking at how do you see the opportunity set in terms of actually putting investment dollars to work and capitalizing on the disruption out there dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well we actually continue to look into the market and see to a certain extent obviously we all saw what happened last year that a lot of our larger peers well two of them were gone and then some of the other peers are having some financial difficulty or transitioning and whatnot and so from that from a competitive landscape i think it is marginally better for east west bank east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 but we have always been prudent and the reason we didnt get into trouble is because we dont try to go all out in any one particular direction were always trying to look at making sure that we have a diversified portfolio so in terms of recruiting talents and so forth were very selective were trying to make sure that there have there are talents out there to have the right mindset that fit into the east west culture and also they are in the kind of like business that fit into our sweet spot and then we will bring them over and well continue to be out there recruiting and looking for the right talents to join us and together with our own associate who continue to grow and so we feel that we cannot predict exactly what the economy is going to be like but we do know what east west can do which is that our team will find a way to continue to bring in new customers and well be able to continue to help support our existing customers and with that well be able to grow deposits well be able to grow loans and also have meaningful fee diversified fee income and thats the plan ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america securitiesmerrill lynch got it ill requeue thank you operator the next question comes from ben gerlinger with citi please go ahead benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc good afternoon christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc good afternoon ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc audio gap christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc so ben i think we missed a good portion of your question but i think your question was broadly around deposit betas and how do we think deposit betas unfold and so i think theres a couple of thoughts here the first part is we had a reasonable uptick in deposit beta as rates rose we would expect to have a reasonable downtick in deposit pricing as rates fall specifically we are expecting our deposit beta to be north of on the downtick and i think that is a that we recognize we could be more aggressive on particularly if rate cuts come sooner or faster and we would note that we think theres upside to that level if we can get our arms around the pace of cuts that we expect and i think thatll be fed path dependent but i think were very comfortable that theres upside to that if we can get some clarity on that as we move through the course of the year east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got it thats helpful operator gerlinger if you could pick up a handset perhaps if youre on the speakerphone by any chance benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc audio gap christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc we continue to see as a year for continued investment in our core businesses and platforms and so while we recognize that up may be a higher number than youve heard from some others we would also suggest that a efficiency ratio is a much better start point than you have for many others and we think thats the right decision to make for the longterm strength of east west franchise benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc we would also note that growth off a efficiency is a lot lower than growth say off of a its just for conversations operator okay the next question comes from dave rochester with compass point please go ahead david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good afternoon guys under nii guide what are you guys assuming for deposit growth in that and what are you baking in for the btfp maturity thats coming up and if you can just give like a rough estimate what are you seeing in terms of what a single cut means from a margin or nii impact at this point just given the assumptions that you talked about on deposit betas christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah so we fully expect to fund all of our loan growth with core deposit funding we expect to pay down btfp over the course of the year it rolled over in march well pay down some well roll over some and well be exiting the program in all likelihood by yearend and with regard to sort of the rate sensitivity its somewhere in the million to million per cut per month is one way to think about it and i think were sort of working our way through that but thats in the zip code east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great and then the pay down of the btfp is that are you expecting to do that with deposits or could you fund that with some wholesale funding as well christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc well at the march date well pay down some well roll over some well have some securities coming due well have a variety of other things if we have better than expected deposit growth well certainly avail ourselves of that better deposit flow but whatever is left over well just refinance at the end david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great and then maybe one last one on the loan pipeline it sounded like that was looking pretty good obviously youre expecting to grow loans really faster than other larger banks how are you thinking about the composition of that growth this year if you can just go through some of the puts and takes on that itd be great christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah the pipeline strength that were seeing today is primarily on the residential mortgage side which has been a strong contributor to our growth over the past year and we expect we will be the strongest contributor here certainly over the nearterm david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great thanks guys operator the next question comes from gary tenner with da davidson please go ahead gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good afternoon just a quick dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good afternoon gary gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co hey a quick followup question on the loan growth guide given the strength of growth in the back half of the year near annualized i would have thought that it would be maybe a little higher than that just wondering about kind of the ci activity in the fourth quarter was there any sort of pull forward or drawdowns that were more seasonal in nature that were kind of normalized here early in the first quarter that would impact the point to point loan growth outlook east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc we did see an uptick in utilization in december and so that utilization rate as you may not be surprised came back a little bit in january but nonetheless we would expect ci to be additionally contributor to our growth but as i just mentioned to mr rochester i think residential growth will lead the way and from what were hearing and seeing from our activity levels on the cre side cre will be muted level of growth net for the year irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc and ill just add the ci utilization at yearend the trends are not that different lets say from the prior year as well right well pick up at your end gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co yeah irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc its pretty normal for us gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co yeah got you and then just as a followup in terms of your guidance in the past and i hadnt chance to look back and i apologize have you not guided to also a fee income growth rate correct me if im wrong if thats not the case but if it was curious as to why you did not indiscernible christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc ive only been here one quarter but it wasnt in last quarters numbers gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co yeah okay not fair enough i apologize i dont have a chance to take a look back prior to asking the question so all right thank you operator the next question comes from casey haire with jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good afternoon everyone maybe first one just apologies if i missed this the expense guide is that examortization or does that include that and if so what is the tax amortization expense going forward christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 it is excluding the onetime items and excluding the tax amortization so its already reported adjusted expense which is net of those things so its a clean operating expense level and we think the clean level comes up a bit casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay but there will be a tax amortization hitting the pl correct christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc there will yeah and so the tax amortization expense as you can see from this quarters numbers can sometimes bounce around from quartertoquarter we havent given you a specific guide for that but were also looking at adopting pam with the new accounting standard for that which may move the numbers around geographically so therell probably be a reduction yearoveryear in amortization expense and a slight uptick in the tax rate as a result but those two will net out to the bottom line casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you okay thanks for clearing that up and then just switching to capital just thoughts on buyback appetite going forward with the still strong cet1 irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc well thats correct we do have strong capital thats something were very proud of we do have the remaining authorization certainly thats something that well evaluate over the course of the coming months right operator okay the next question comes from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good afternoon on the nim trough in the second half of is a little later than what others are suggesting you know hear your comments on the beta on the downside but are you modelling some sort of lag into your deposit betas on the way down because i know you also mentioned that the nim should rebound in after the lower funding costs kick in so i was wondering if there is a little bit of a lag there christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc theres a little bit of a lag i would say driven by the fact that you have to remember we have a fair amount of cds on the books and so those cds for example our lunar cds special thats in the market today will be in place for the next six months so well book those here january and february theyll be with us until july august and so therell be a bit of a lag because of the cds that were pricing today versus what will happen so again depending on the timing and the pace of rate cuts we could outperform that and certainly as those roll over six months from now we would expect to fully participate in the benefit of those lower funding costs at that point in time east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great and maybe flipping over to credit there remain a lot of concerns around california commercial real estate can you talk about why your book is different and also what youre hearing from borrowers right now and how negotiations are going given that given the outlook for lower rates coming up irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc yeah thanks thats a great question and as you can see from what weve reported when we look at the criticized classified assets those ratios the nonperforming loan ratios the criticized loans are down nonperforming loans are down were pleased with that as we look at the different categories office multifamily etcetera within cre were comfortable with the loan grades were also very pleased to see that there are not a lot of new problem loans that are coming up so overall these conversations with customers certainly there are some that were working through but its very manageable at this point and were very pleased to see that all the efforts and work that we went through the last couple of years to shore up borrowers have them pay down have them swap by cap those are all things that we see as positive today dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc also as we highlighted in the previous calls before that we dont have that many loans mature well neither in nor in a very small percentage of loans coming due so we actually really dont have much opportunity to have too many conversation with our customers in terms of dealing with some of the challenge when it comes to refinancing and keep in mind that we have very low ltv and our portfolio is quite granular so i think thats the reason why our portfolio so far stands up really well versus some of the other banks manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and sorry if i missed it but did you update what your reserve levels were on cre office and if its still around or so as it was last quarter can you talk about what keeps you comfortable with that level of reserves christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc its on page of the slide deck and it was at year end which is up obviously from the you cited manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and what keeps you up irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 indiscernible yeah office and all of cre we have a rigorous process where we go through the portfolios our rms our team leader credit supervision all work together and i think as were going through these loan reviews on a regular basis and the cash flows from the clients the properties those are all things that help us and the cash quite candidly and the network many of our borrowers and indiscernible are all things that give us comfort manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator operator instructions the next question comes from matthew clark with piper sandler please go ahead matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey good afternoon thank you for the questions first one just around deposits if you can speak to your outlook on noninterestbearing down here this quarter just your expectation on where that might trough relative to the mix and then it also looks like your chinese new year special is at least on your website so just thoughts there around kind of growth going forward is it going to continue to be dominated by cds christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc in the near term we expect cd growth certainly in the first quarter to be a significant contributor our current lunar cd special will attract good flows its been out there for about a week and the early read on that has been very positive both on the consumer side and in the private banking client base so were encouraged by that and that will result partly in some of the deposit compression we expect to see in the first quarter with regard to overall levels of noninterestbearing demand accounts we have previously bottomed out in the high we were at at sort of a low point we think we are trending in that level today and we think that is a relative benchmark from which we will grow from over time matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just on some spot rates it looks like that slide is no longer in there that detail give us spot rate on deposits at year end and then just a related question well on the other side on the resi mortgage book you show a rate sheet price for 30year fixed is your portfolio is at which obviously includes hybrids but can you give us a sense for kind of the spot rate on that book as well you would think you get some decent lift out of that rate the two questions within there im sorry christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah so i would say we have started to see aside from the cds saw the deposit rates flatten out and some even start to trend lower and on the mortgages yes it was at year end and its in the zone as we sit here today east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc the spot rate on deposits at year end was matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you operator the next question comes from andrew terrell with stephens please go ahead andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc hey thanks good afternoon everybody dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good afternoon andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc i wanted to circle back to the expense guidance just a little bit can you talk maybe chris just about how we should expect the expense run rate to progress throughout the year it feels like we could see kind of a seasonal bump earlier in the year and then kind of run rate moderation into the back half especially if were to get the forward curve to play out and you get that relief on the deposit costs so any color on kind of the run rate throughout the year on expenses will be helpful christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc i think you call that correctly so were not going to see a material savings in deposit related costs in the first quarter absent some fed rate action and maybe even a slight delay in the second quarter so those cost savings and those benefits will really come in the third and fourth quarter and on the other side we are going to see an increase in our comp and benefit expense as we move through the first quarter as we go through the normal round of salary adjustments that we do here every year and so as those numbers roll through which will pick up at the end of the first quarter theyll impact expenses a little bit in the first quarter and then well see the offsets coming in as rates decline later in the year andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay great i appreciate it and if i could also ask just as we think about maybe the opportunity for some of the btfp reduction that you talked about earlier can you just remind us the cash flow youd expect off the bond book coming in christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc roughly billion or million a quarter east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay great i appreciate it operator the next question comes from brandon king with truist securities please go ahead brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good afternoon dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good afternoon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so on the strong ci loan growth in the quarter and i didnt see this in the deck but could you comment on what the utilization levels were and then just give us your expectations for utilization levels and if we could potentially see maybe indiscernible uptick if rates come down from christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc the utilization level was at year end i think when we look about when we think about uptick its a demand dependent question though and we would say in a softening economy we dont expect demand to run away with that number in brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and then lastly just on the hedges you have and then indiscernible you have how do you currently feel about your position and are you looking to potentially add more christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yes i feel we certainly got comfort in the fourth quarter that our forward starting hedges were a good call as i mentioned in my comments some of them are already in the money so you dont usually put a trade on expecting to be in the money in the same quarter but im glad we did and were looking forward to an outlook that should have those cash flowing as we move to the end of the year which is always a wonderful thing brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it so feel pretty comfortable where youre at is a fair way to say it christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc absolutely east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks for taking my questions christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc thank you operator the next question comes from brody preston with ubs please go ahead brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good afternoon everyone dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good afternoon brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc i just wanted to follow up on a couple of things real quick on the nii the cash flow hedges are there any maturities through on the swaps that we need to be aware of and then you said earlier that you expect that the deposit beta on the way down just wanted to clarify if that was interestbearing deposit beta on the way down through is that a correct interpretation christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah that will we will save at least half of every move in the fed funds rate that the fed engineers in the form of reduced deposit costs collectively across our deposit base on the interestbearing deposits with regard to the cash flow hedges there really are no material maturities in however two of our earliest or oldest trades will actually mature early in and there are two of the lowest strike points so it gets better as we move into brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay do you happen to have the dollar amount of those two hedges christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah those two hedges are both underwater at billion and so theyre currently part of the drag and as we move through obviously as rates decline they incrementally improve as well but when they go away therell be probably a net pickup in in the first quarter brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 okay and then chris my last one i just wanted to clarify on the tax stuff weve seen a couple other banks i think adopt that this earnings season where i think effectively the amortization almost went to zero and its going to show up in a higher tax rate just wanted to ask if you guys adopted that treatment should we expect something similar and if so you know i know that you guys have some lumpy amortization so would that kind of introduce quartertoquarter kind of peaks and valleys in the tax rate itself christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah so our goal in adopting pam will be to dampen out the volatility that youve seen to introduce a greater level of stability and it will help us on certain of the tax credits however on those tax credits such as the energy tax credits that we placed into service as project completed basis that level of volatility from when the projects get placed in a service will continue to be with us and will continue to flow as amortization in sort of above the line so we will not go to zero it will be dampened and reduced and it will be both a function of how much we do in the different types of credits and how we moderate that activity as we think about making this a less volatile component of our expense stream moving forward and our goal is to make it brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc thank you very much christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc less of a talking point and more of a steady state number for you guys brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc awesome i appreciate it thank you operator the next question comes from timur braziler with wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good afternoon how should we think about the how should we think about the interplay of lower interest rates in your residential product is that seems pretty rate agnostic does demand actually pick up as rates fall and then just maybe talk more broadly what factors impact that line item most dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah well i think its a relatively unique product that really cater to our core asianamerican customers and we always think that the rate is not anywhere i guess sensitive like these traditional fannie mae freddie mac type of products so we feel pretty good about even when rate starts going down the rate reduction from our home mortgages would not be going in the same proportionally at higher pace like the normal products in the market timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2024 got
