22apr2021 on an average basis total cre loans grew by annualized in the first quarter this run rate of growth is stronger than we had originally expected because of higher origination volume ph our total traditional cre lending customers as well as lower than anticipated payoffs we expect the cre payoffs to tick up in the second quarter but for the full year we are comfortable that our total cre loan growth will be supported by continued good demand from our customers as the economy reopens and rebounds in slides and we provide details regarding our singlefamily residential loans and home equity lines during the first quarter we originated billion of residential mortgage loans an increase of quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear this was a record quarter of residential mortgage

into adversely graded loans in the first quarter was limited resulting in stable criticized loans quarteroverquarter oil and gas exposures continue to be the largest single concentration in our performing assets and the operating backdrop for this sector is improving outside of oil and gas we do not see systemic issues in our loan portfolio furthermore at million as of march we believe that our allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio as well as incremental reserve build needed for new loan growth we do not expect to record any provision for loan losses for the remainder of the year east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 on slide we present the components of our allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan losses totaled million as of march or basis points of loans held for investment excluding ppp compared with million or basis points as of december and compared with million or basis points on day one post cecl the quarteroverquarter reduction in allowance largely reflects an improved macroeconomic forecast net chargeoffs in the first quarter were million compared with million in the fourth quarter the first quarter net chargeoff ratio was basis points of average loans annualized an improvement of basis points from the fourth quarter of this improvement primarily reflects a decrease in commercial real estate charge offs during the first quarter we recorded no provision for loan losses compared to million in the fourth quarter and now moving to a discussion of our income statement on slide this slide summarizes the key line items of the income statement which ill discuss in more detail in the following slides first quarter income tax expense was million and effective tax rate was compared with million and for the fourth quarter first quarter income tax expense and effective tax rate reflect the benefit of a higher amount of tax credit investments and discrete items compared with the prior quarter also fourth quarter income tax expense included million related to dc solar tax credit investments ill now review the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin on slides through starting with average balance sheet growth first quarter average loans of billion grew by billion or linked quarter annualized the growth rate accelerated from the fourth quarter and was broadbased across the major loan categories with the strongest growth from residential mortgage first quarter average deposits of billion grew by billion or linked quarter annualized all deposit categories grew led by growth in noninterest bearing demand deposits at a rate of annualized with a strong deposit growth our average loan to deposit ratio was in the first quarter down from in the fourth quarter during the first quarter we deployed some cash into debt securities available for sale and also repo assets on a quarterly average basis securities afs increased by billion and repo assets increased by million during the second quarter of million of our fhlb funding carrying effective interest rate of will mature which we expect to pay off turning to slide first quarter net interest income of million grew by linked quarter annualized and the net interest margin was a decrease of basis points from the prior quarter excluding income related to ppp loans our first quarter adjusted net interest income of million grew by linked quarter annualized net interest income related to ppp loans was million in the first quarter compared with million in the fourth quarter as of march we had million of ppp loan deferred fees to accrete into income the basis points quarter overquarter decrease in the first quarter gaap nim breaks down as follows plus basis points from a lower cost of interestbearing deposits plus basis points from more dda in the funding mix offset by minus basis points from lower loan yields and minus basis points from excess liquidity due to the strong deposit growth turning to slide first quarter average loan yield was and excluding the impact of ppp the adjusted loan yield was down by basis points quarteroverquarter from reflecting the impact of low interest rate in our own portfolio east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 turning to slide our cost of deposits continues to decline as maturing higher price cds reprice to current market rates our average cost of deposits for the first quarter dropped to basis points down from basis points in the fourth quarter the spot rate of total deposits as of march was basis points our first quarter average cost of interestbearing deposits dropped to basis points down from basis points in the fourth quarter the spot rate of interestbearing deposits as of march was basis points the quarterover quarter improvement was primarily driven by the repricing of cds as well as by a decrease in the cost of money market accounts the average cost of cds in the first quarter was basis points a meaningful drop of basis points from basis points in the fourth quarter in the first quarter we originated or renewed billion of domestic us cds at a blended rate of basis points and a weighted average term of four months we have million of cds maturing in the second quarter at a blended rate of basis points and another million in the third quarter at a blended rate of basis points moving on to fee income on slide total noninterest income in the first quarter was million up from million in the fourth quarter first quarter fee income and net gains on sales of loans were million growing by annualized from the fourth quarter higher foreign exchange income wealth management and deposit account fees reflected growth in customerdriven transactions for these business lines fee income growth momentum is continuing into the second quarter and we expect these business lines to show strength for the full year the quarteroverquarter increase in interest rate contracts and other derivative income reflected a favorable change in the credit valuation adjustment due to the increase in benchmark longterm interest rates and an improved macroeconomic outlook the decline in interest rate contracts revenue reflects the lower customer transaction volume and demand in the current environment moving on to slide first quarter noninterest expense was million excluding amortization of tax credits and other investments and core deposit intangible amortization adjusted noninterest expense was million in the first quarter a decrease of million quarteroverquarter reductions in overall operating expenses more than offset increased compensation and employee benefit expense which is typically higher in the first quarter due to payroll taxes and other payrollrelated expenses yearoveryear adjusted noninterest expense increased by in the first quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was compared with in the fourth quarter over the past five quarters our efficiency ratio has ranged from to despite operating headwinds from the covid pandemic related economic slowdown and near zero interest rates and with that ill now review our updated full year outlook for on slide for the full year of compared to our full year results we expect that yearoveryear loan growth excluding ppp will be approximately narrowing to the upper end of our prior range of to yearoveryear adjusted net interest income growth excluding ppp will be generally in line with loan growth on a full year basis in the current interest rate environment we are focused on net interest income growth which will be primarily driven by loan growth for our bank underpinning our interest income assumptions is the current forward interest rate curve adjusted noninterest expense growth excluding tax credit investment amortization up yearover year narrowing to the upper end of our prior range of to east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 this change parallels to the update of our loan growth outlook and largely reflects growth in compensation expense and higher computer software amortization expense as we amortize previously capitalized technology investments compensation expense will reflect loan production and revenue growth for the year our updated outlook for revenue expense translates to higher pretax preprovision income growth for compared to our prior expectations i would add that we also expect to see stable to modestly improving operating leverage for the year compared to based on our macroeconomic forecasts and loan growth outlook we do not expect to book provision for loan credit losses for the full year finally full year effective tax rate of approximately including the impact of tax credit investment unchanged from our prior outlook there will be quarterly variability in the tax rate due to the timing of tax credit investments placed into service with that ill now turn the call back to dominic for closing remarks dominic ng chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you irene in closing we had a very good start to the year with attractive growth in profitability and look forward to delivering strong financial results for our shareholders in i will now open up the call to questions operator question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions first question comes from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess my first question is just around im trying to figure out the potential for upside to your loan growth outlook dominic if you could help us just across the three major buckets one on the residential mortgage side is there any reason to believe that momentum slows on ci what are the industries that you think will drive loan growth and then on cre it sounded a lot more constructive than you did in the last two to six months so is there the reopening or what you are hearing from clients makes you feel better about cre activity for the year thank you east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc okay three yeah the three buckets so residential mortgages and home equity in fact ive been predicting it to slow down for the last four or five years and i havent succeeded weve been having a very strong momentum in the residential mortgages and home equity lines of business for actually quite a few years now i said almost were getting tired of setting record every quarter after quarter i think that obviously these low interest rate help but for what weve seen so far i mean our momentum has continued to grow strong and i look at even so far in april its kept going and at this stage right now i just dont see the residential mortgage to come down much simply because we are getting good momentum both on refinance from home purchases and our home equity lines are picking up really strong so at this stage right now i think that should be looking pretty good to continue on for a while on the ci side i think that the good news really is that we are getting new customers we continue to getting really highquality new customers i think since the ppp back in april of we were successfully getting some very highquality customers because of a bit more chaotic situation ph now in some of the other banks that allow us to able to demonstrate that our service level are better so from that standpoint when we also looked at in terms of our ci side is to grow from many different verticals many different geographical regions so its pretty evenly distributed and the commitments continue to grow so of course in the first quarter we havent got that picked up much from the outstanding balance standpoint of view simply because we always have a solid first quarter thats the nature of our ci business so we do expect that in particular as we highlighted at irenes guidance in the third and fourth quarter well be most likely seeing more pickup from not only just because the economy would open up more its because the nature of the business tend to have more drawdown in the third and fourth quarter so thats been going great on the cre side ive highlighted in my sort of like presentation earlier is that the anticipated payoff for first quarter didnt happen as high as we expected we do expect that maybe it will be happening in the second quarter but all in all i would say that we are seeing good momentum from our traditional core customers in the cre sector where many of our customers now are feeling more positive and in fact they see opportunities and in fact they started even in the late third and fourth quarter of last year and they continue to look for investment opportunities and this allows us the opportunity to actually see some decent growth in our cre so far so we are watching the progress and as of today i would say that we are comfortable very comfortable with our guidance that we laid out so far ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc go it helpful color and just as a quick followup in terms of just the deposit growth it was very strong this quarter do you have a breakdown of how much of the growth came from the us versus hong kong and greater china do you see that as continuing dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc i will would say i mean because as you know hong kong and china is just a very small part of our deposit total so most of the deposits are coming from the united states east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc do you see that as continuing dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yes well i looked at it well when you look at these 40someodd percent annualized growth rate or like annualized growth of dda those are kind of things that we think has a lot to do with the current economic environment but what i wanted to share is that i dont necessarily pay too much attention to this sort of like big deposit growth quarterbyquarter which has been happening for the last couple of quarters but i would say that im much more interested to look at do we have high quality customers coming into the bank do we have these new do we have high growth in the new customers that originated by our branches by our commercial lending officer and the commercial bankers throughout us and china and so far thats been happening in fact our treasury management cash management products team are working day and night overtime opening account setting up all these online banking and digital banking requirements for our customers because we are getting more new customers and that to me is very encouraging and we are hoping that that continued growth will sustain and that will allow us to really have a much more meaningful core customer base going forward and this is above and beyond just the current environment because many banks also have high deposit balance growth for the last quarter but thats what i am really focusing on how many new customers we have and what kind of customer are they these customer call to have a sustainability going forward and those are the one im paying attention and i feel pretty good right now that we will continue to see growth from this set of new customers and together with existing customers who are expanding their relationship with us because our core capability from product and technologywise are getting better which allow us to be able to take on more complex deposit setup operator our next question comes from ken zerbe with morgan stanley please go ahead ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thanks good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning ken dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc hi ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i guess first probably a pretty easy one in terms of the provision expense guidance i just want to make sure i understand it correctly so youre not going to book a provision expense for the full year are you saying that it is east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 generally going to be zero for each of the next quarters or could it potentially be meaningfully negative if you do end up releasing a significant amount of reserves irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc and thats a great question i dont have a crystal ball honestly but with our guidance of the zero as we kind of project out and we model out right now the likelihood of having to add net provision is very low at this point in time and thats really what drove the change that we made to our guidance the minmax of what might happen each quarter certainly that could vary and certainly it is possible that will have a negative provision but nonetheless im very comfortable at this point in time with the zero provision for the full year ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay perfect and then just a quick followup in terms of the ppp amortization with million remaining but you did million this quarter it seems that it could potentially fall pretty noticeably on a goforward basis can you just remind us what your amortization schedule is of that million is it a straight line over five years or is it more heavily weighted towards the front end irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah its more heavily weighted towards the front end and ill also add weve had a fair amount of paydowns as well if we look at that in the first quarter there was a period of time where we stopped doing the ppp loan forgiveness but were back up on that in fact actually last week we started opening our portal for ppp forgiveness for ppp round two as well operator our next question comes from michael young with truist securities please go ahead michael young q analyst truist securities inc hey thanks for the question irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning michael young q analyst truist securities inc just wanted to start with the nii guide and make sure i understand so the increase in the loan growth to would have a commensurate increase in the nii guide to growth off the base number from last year east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc i dont know certainly if thats going to exactly correlate but it will definitely be in line michael michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay and then my followup is just sort of on the additional liquidity bill that keeps coming with a strong deposit growth do you have any updated thoughts about deploying that given kind of where rates have moved to today andor any additional analysis of sort of the stickiness of those deposits going forward irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question certainly in the first quarter with kind of the rate movement and our comfort level as far as the deposits the growth that weve had the growth that we expect in the pipeline that was some of the decisions and factors that we considered as we redeployed some of that cash that we had been building into securities and to repos and keep in mind obviously also the part of that consideration was the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet and also keeping in mind with the securities that we did purchase and the repos we did extend duration but being cognizant of the fact that we didnt want to extend too much so the repos libor plus basis points kind of pricing and then the securities as well largely what weve been buying are treasuries gse kind of stepups things like that where were comfortable that were earning a little bit more money cash today on the cash today but not extending duration too much in this kind of environment on a goforward basis evaluating kind of our liquidity the deposit growth thats certainly something that well continue to look at and evaluate over the course of the year operator our next question comes from brock vandervliet from ubs please go ahead brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for the question if you could just kind of review kind of the puts and takes on the non interest income and the fx derivatives service charges weve been expecting those kind of come in fairly materially off a very strong  and they actually headed higher what should we be looking for in the balance of the year or the next quarter irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah so i think if you look at the accompanying debt that we have on page i think we do a nice job of breaking out the fee income from a customer transaction perspective reconciling back to the gaap so if you look at each line items foreign fx income we have seen a lot more kind of transaction volume and number of clients so in the prepared remarks we talked about it how that we expect that that to continue the momentum particularly on a yearoveryear basis so far in the second quarter were doing pretty well as well on the wealth management side same thing at various points in with the pandemic there wasnt a lot of customer activity we saw more interest weve also kind of expanded and have some great kind of product east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 offerings for our customers that they like and that has certainly helped as well i would say also on with a strong deposit growth that dominic spoke about and we talked about in the prepared remarks the gtsrelated deposit account fees continued to grow and we expect that to continue to grow over the course of the year as well so really the ph irsc contract the customer revenue related revenue given the kind of the rate environment thats probably the category where i dont see this kind of level of growth for the full year but other areas were very positive yearoveryear dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah so i just wanted to add again its like when you look at noninterest income foreign exchange and global treasury services cash management and the consumer branch fees these are the type and wealth management these are all customerrelated type of fee income and thats what im talking about earlier that we are getting new customers and we are getting new customers well obviously because of the great dedicated service from our associates throughout the us and china more importantly because of the investment that we made from digital banking to fx to cash management et cetera these investment that we made allow us to now have the capability to take on some of those additional sort of like product capability that we have now to allow us to earn these additional fees and have we not had some of these technological ph enhancement deals we wouldnt be able to generate ecs even though we might have these customers before but some of these customers are not able to transact everything with east west before because we did not have the technical capability but the last few years slowly gradually were building up that capability and we are seeing that result now in our noninterest income and i would expect that will continue to grow and thats why its important for us to also continue to invest irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc ill also add last year including largely in lending fees we had warrant income of about million which we dont expect to occur so aside from that we do expect good growth in fee income brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it thanks for the color nice quarter dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc youre welcome thank you operator the next question comes from dave rochester from compass point please go ahead david rochester q managing director director of research compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys nice growth this quarter east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thanks dave david rochester q managing director director of research compass point research trading llc was wondering if you could talk about where new loan yields are today across your major loan buckets as well as new securities yields just given a steeper curve and then would be glad to hear where the overall average yield was on those securities purchases in irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah hold one minute let me get that for you my computer locked up so while ive got it just give me one minute david rochester q managing director director of research compass point research trading llc no problem irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc all right and in the excitement of my computer locking up i didnt hear the last part of your question so would you mind repeating that david rochester q managing director director of research compass point research trading llc oh sure just where the securities purchases were this quarter in terms of just the overall yield irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah that i dont need to look up so the securities that we purchase generally are about ph basis points so lower than kind of the yield that we had before but as i said earlier we wanted to just make sure from a duration perspective we were comfortable and then give me one minute here if you look at kind of the loan yields currently new quarter loan yields generally for ci the loans about kind of probably including fees for commercial real estate were at probably ph flying flat and then consumer loans in total were about basis points david rochester q managing director director of research compass point research trading llc great and then for resi thats still north of east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc the basis points was combined for let me clarify for heloc and single family david rochester q managing director director of research compass point research trading llc got you okay so the resi piece is now i guess maybe a little bit below irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thats right david rochester q managing director director of research compass point research trading llc that all combines okay great and just my second irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc the blended prospective would be yeah the blended prospective would be ph arm portfolios as well david rochester q managing director director of research compass point research trading llc okay great and then you guys have plenty of capital today you still have that buyback outstanding was just wondering what could prompt you to take a closer look at that buyback as we go through the year if you have any specific capital targets youre looking at just any color there would be great thanks dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc we are having pretty decent growth so far and so i mean this whole idea about having a little bit more capital than our peers is well during the pandemic particularly at the beginning of the pandemic when everybody panicked we didnt have to panic as much because we have plenty of capital so now i think when the economy starts rebounding we have very nice growth as you can see our huge deposit and even loan growth is pretty strong and so we really looked at is that its nice to have that kind of capital that in case ph will get even stronger weve got plenty of capital to support that so at this stage right now i think that we are going to stay ph put and see how it goes keep in mind though even with where our capital is today as i just shared that we have a return of equity tangible equity of which is not bad and thats the way we see it when we ph cant pull in this kind of like return we dont need to spend too much time in terms of managing the capital too tight operator our next question comes from elan zanger with jefferies please go ahead east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 elan zanger q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning just wanted to touch on credit i was a little bit surprised to see the oil and gas ph aci actually go up despite the better backdrop did see a little bit of migration can you maybe talk to the outlook in that book and the reserve for that kind of going forward for this year irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question so the reserve calculation did increase a little bit part of it is correlated to a little bit adverse migration into substandard and then also specific reserves that we had for some of the nonaccrual loans so if you look at the total reserve that we had for the oil and gas portfolio was million for the outstanding loans compared to million as of december overall i would say that were continuing to work through the portfolio generally the outlook is more positive but certainly we want to be prudent and kind of conservative with our reserving there elan zanger q analyst jefferies llc okay and i think you touched on the china theme earlier but just could we maybe get a pulse on the outlook for crossborder activity maybe for the second half of this year dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yes the crossborder activity is going very well in fact again its getting back to its a combination of people and technology again what weve noticed is that despite the fact that we as i shared earlier that most of deposit growth is coming from us and then the loan growth mainly from us interesting enough quite a few of those deposits have that crossborder elements into it and quite a bit of even the loans have a bit of cross border elements into it is because we actually have many of our customers that are doing business in us but that have either ownership from china or hong kong and so we are doing a lot more business now in terms of a customer that requires maybe us providing a loans and commercial deposit setup in us in addition to that they have business in china and hong kong that also set up additional commercial banking relationship with us and also have either guarantee support of letter of credit to show up the credit strength for us and its this kind of like a crossborder type of transaction that east west is very proud to have the ability to be able to handle it in and different time zones and we also have the compliance regulatory expertise that can understand the rule and regulations in different regions and so we are going to continue to be able to get these type of business that in general from a east west point of view that we do not have that kind of competition against our peer banks in us and more importantly we would end up underwriting credit to have substantially less actual risk versus perceived risk from other banks who dont know anything about this crossborder kind of business so in that standpoint we will continue to expect that we will do well going forward in our sort of like bridge between east and west type of value proposition and were really looking at it in the next two years therell be more opportunities to come for us operator our next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo please go ahead east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc looking at credit and losses with the basis points this quarter do you think that weve turned the corner on loss content and should we be looking at this as sort of the high watermark for expectations given the broader economic backdrop or could we see more episodic losses as we go through the year dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well i think that from our perspective what were most comfortable with is really looking at our entire loan portfolio overall that when we see that our criticized loans has been stable and we also continue to review our loan portfolio one sector at a time we recently just have another cre loan review and then we look at these different industry verticals on ci and so forth and based on our review we feel pretty confident that our loan portfolio overall has in terms of credit quality has been very good and in terms of any kind of major concern that would it get even worse at this stage right now i would say it is not very likely theres always going to be occasional one or two loans that we ended up charging off but in terms of overall do we have enough reserve for our sort of like loan portfolio i would say that were very very confident that we have plenty of reserves and allowances to cover any potential losses in the future jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right great good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 hey good morning how are you doing just a quick housekeeping on the tax rate and the am expense any color on the cadence for the rest of the year i think million was kind of the thought on the expense previously irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah certainly and that weve talked about this before depending on the timing of the investment that can be a little bounce around but at this point in time our and with the tax rate the effective tax rate that were assuming it also includes million for the full year of credits and million from amortization perspective for full year christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so million so that will pick up from here okay great thank you irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc youre welcome operator the next question comes from matthew clark with piper sandler please go ahead matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning first question just on the core nii guide it looks like in order to get to that you need assets to grow faster than loans and that just wondering if that phenomenon could put some additional pressure on your core nim or do you think going from cash into securities can help mitigate that just trying to get a sense for whether or not we troughed in the core nim irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah i think thats a great question we do think that the nii growth will correlate with the loan growth and then as you pointed out with the kind of redeployment of some of that excess cash into securities that will help from an nii perspective and also in nim ill also point out that our continued kind of repricing on the funding side the deposits the indiscernible also helps as well so at this point in time although its hard to predict exactly where that nim is going to fall out based on largely at this point the deposits and the excess liquidity were comfortable that our margin will stabilize and could kind of even modestly increase matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and then last one for me just on the on slide of the deck your ci average loan yield of basis points this quarter exppp just given your growth prospects i guess how can you i guess how do you feel comfortable i guess pricing at that level how do you ensure that youre getting paid for the risk youre taking i guess is my question irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 yeah i think with rates being so low thats a question that we have every day every day we talk about it with our rms our team leaders and the credit team and the treasurer i think thats not just ci its also cre as well for us as you know singlefamily and heloc the credit quality is so extraordinary im not concerned there and then from a product offering perspective also we have a unique product so for ci and cre honestly i think thats also were being very careful to make sure from a overall return perspective from kind of a credit quality perspective we are careful with that and with thats reflected in kind of the growth numbers as well that were expecting operator the next question comes from gary tenner with d a davidson please go ahead gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co guys good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co i had a couple of questions good morning first in terms of the ci growth and just kind of a general taking temperature of that customer base could you comment on kind of what degree growth is coming from the specialty verticals and if any of those specialty verticals that are getting particularly more active dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well weve been fortunate i mean i think since i would say the latter part of third quarter of last year we were really seeing a positive momentum from just pretty much every single vertical every so every month theres another team that come out stronger than the other one its a nice little internal competition which is really healthy but if i look at in the first quarter from a loan outstanding point of view i would say that the few that stand out for the first quarter for ci loan outstanding loan growth will be mainly entertainment healthcare technology and a little bit of the crossborder business so now but in terms of commitment so some of them done well in terms of booking commitment they just couldnt get anything funded like for example private equity capital call lines they got some nice commitment they just havent been able to get their loan funded but in time you would think that some of these private equity funds they raise money to invest so in time you would think that they would start investing so i would expect that different quarter will be a different mix at this stage im pretty comfortable that different sectors are going to be doing quite well other than in the oil and gas that we decided to really just slow down and continue to have the balance to come down to less than billion and thats what weve been working on and its been working so far gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 got it thank you and then in terms of the provision guide kind of a followup question there if you assume growth exppp and kind of a zero provision over the course that seems to get you pretty close the day one cecl allowance plus or minus ph million million does that has there been any changes that could maybe longer term drive that allowance below the cecl day one or is that kind of the glide path to more of a base level irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah my math works out the same as yours certainly i think theyre depending on kind of what happens largely to the forecast i think it could drive lower if we look at it as a versus day one cecl near term the drivers such as unemployment that are certainly higher today but when we look at the forecast over multiyears its better gdp growth is also something over the next couple years looks to be better so there are other drivers i think that especially if they improve could drive that lower but certainly thats something were looking at very carefully operator operator instructions our next question comes from david chiaverini with wedbush securities please go ahead david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks my first question is kind of a combo question between expenses and loan so expenses were down in the quarter but the guide was raised to the upper end of the range to from to and you mentioned that its driven by growth in compensation related to loan production and computer software expense i guess the question is are you hiring on the loan team side of things or is the loan growth that youre expecting more a function of increased commitments and pipelines from the existing teams dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc we do we have higher additional people i wouldnt say that we have made a significant hiring i think that i would say the vast majority of our growth is coming from our existing team irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah and ill just add and part of that commentary is really the point that if we look at it payroll is up also when we look at kind of the revenue from and the expectations for growth on the lending side the fee income side we are also increasing our bonus pool that weve set aside given that our expectations our revenue and net income will be up considerably yearoveryear and if you look at it i mean the yearoveryear increase from the first quarter this quarter to last year is about so hopefully that gives you some perspective around that dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc and the other thing the last year is not what i call a normal year had last year has been relatively normal i would think that the incremental increase would not be as much at all simply because last year that we have reduced expenses quite a bit so everything is relative east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2021 david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks for that and then shifting gears to the deposit growth really nice this quarter and you mentioned about the digital banking platform and the success youre having with treasury management and small business customers i was wondering can you break out the split between commercial and consumer in terms of driving that deposit growth was one weighted more than the other during the quarter dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc do we have that number irene irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc i dont have the specific breakout but its definitely more weighted towards commercial david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc all right irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc and ill note even for our retail branches growth on consumer and commercial have both been very nice dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah i mean strong on both side ph its just had and probably a little bit more irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc the dollars are much bigger dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like
