unprecedented times our teams commitment to putting our clients first is a true reflection of our values as a governmentdesignated essential service we remained open and our branch associates were out there every day to help customers back in early april out of locations we strategically closed branches for the purpose of creating excess resource capacity as part of our business contingency plan under the pandemic all branches were opened and resumed normal hours at the end of june as an organization our number one priority is to provide a safe operating environment for both our associates and our customers to that end we adopted all of our locations with enhanced safety and cleanliness measures we continue workfromhome plans for nonbranch associates and the transition to remote work

communities that we serve through these challenging times we funded billion of sba ppp loans during the second quarter for over small to mediumsized business and nonprofit organizations that cumulatively support over employees the median loan size that we funded was and over of the loans were under in size in addition over of the customers we provide ppp loans to are new customers for east west bank for east west the bottom line is that our customers were thriving before this crisis and that we will help them through the crisis to thrive again when the pandemic is over to that end we offer various payment accommodations and deferrals for impacted commercial and consumer customers at the second quarterend of our total loans received a covid19related payment deferral of these modifications are three months deferral as you can see the details on slide as of june only of our ci loan portfolio was subject to deferral the deferral rate at the total commercial real estate portfolio was of the billion in ci and cre loan deferrals million or are still making partial payments during the deferral period lastly the deferral rate of our residential mortgage loans consisting of singlefamily mortgages and a home equity line of credit heloc was you can see from the low weighted average loan to value associated with the ph deferred loans which are for cre and for residential mortgage our customers have a east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 lot of equity in their property these deferrals have been to our core customers who are committed to maintaining their homes or projects despite temporary shortfalls in cash flow the volume of requests for commercial real estate loan deferrals peaked in may and for residential mortgage it peaked in april for ci it has been idiosyncratic by loan and industry now i will move on to review our financial condition and the result of this quarter on slide of the presentation this morning we reported second quarter net income of million or per share compared to first quarter net income of million or per share second quarter result include a million provision for credit losses which negatively impact our net income despite the challenging circumstances our financial results continued to be solid reflecting the resilience of our business model resulting in a return of tangible equity of in the second quarter we generated total revenue of million and earned pretax preprovision income of million equivalent to a pretax preprovision profitability ratio of in the bottom chart of slide you can see that our ptpp income and ptpp profitability ratio have withstood the steep drop in interest rates with relative stability at over our ptpp ratio remains strong and reflects the fundamental recurring earning power of our franchise and provides ample cushion to absorb credit costs during this economic uncertainty an important variable helping us maintain our pretax preprovision profitability is our industryleading low efficiency ratios in the second quarter our adjusted operating efficiency ratio was lets move on to slide for a summary review of our balance sheet from an enterprise risk management perspective we are navigating this crisis from a position of strength our balance sheet is strong we have high levels of liquidity and capital and our loans and deposit portfolios are well diversified in the second quarter we grew total loans by annualized and deposit by impressive annualized our loantodeposit ratio as of june was compared to as of march the quarteroverquarter decrease in the loantodeposit ratio reflects the strong deposit growth in the second quarter also our greater china balance sheet include loans of billion which were down quarteroverquarter and deposits of billion which grew by since march additionally we funded the ppp loans through the ppp liquidity facility by drawing on billion strengthening our already substantial liquidity and bolstering our balance sheet capacity to serve our customers turning to slide you can see that east west capital ratios are strong and growing and are some of the highest among regional banks particularly for common and tier equity our book value of tangible equity per share were both up from the prior quarter book value at the end of june was and tangible equity per share was you can see from the chart that our riskbased capital ratios common equity tier tier capital and total capital all increased quarteroverquarter our board of directors have declared third quarter dividends for the companys common stock the common stock cash dividend of is payable on august to stockholders of record on august we did not do any buybacks during the second quarter now lets move to slide to have a discussion of our loan portfolio as of june total loans received a record billion an increase of billion or linked quarter annualized average loan of billion grew by linked quarter annualized during the second quarter loan growth came from ppp loans as well as from our commercial real estate and residential mortgage portfolios average total cre loans grew by linked quarter annualized and average residential mortgage loans grew by linked quarter annualized east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 this mix of growth demonstrates the benefits of east west welldiversified loan portfolio providing us with the ability to generate responsible and attractive growth even under challenging economic conditions as of june ppp loans were billion and the average balance during the second quarter was billion at this point we expect forgiveness of ppp loans to begin later in the third quarter resulting in substantial reductions of these loan balances before the end of this year excluding ppp ci loan balances decreased payoff were distributed across the ci portfolio recall that at the end of the first quarter we saw a runup in drawdowns from our ci clients reflecting market liquidity fears present at that time thanks in part to the sizable federal intervention liquidity fears subside and some of those draws reversed you can see this in the utilization statistics as of june our ci loan utilization was moderating from three months ago and in line with as of yearend of the rate of decrease in our ci loan portfolio was highest in april and may and moderated in june noticeably ci loan pipelines have picked up since june and we are seeing broadbased deal flows from across our portfolios including in private equity capital call loans crossborder business and entertainment during the second quarter we also undertook a vigorous review of our loan portfolio evaluating credit exposures for sensitivity to prospective weakening of economic conditions through this process we reviewed over of our ci and cre loans with a particular focus on sectors that are of higher risk during the pandemic to reduce focus on ph uptodate financials and information from our customers how they were adapting operations to the pandemic conditions and what were the sources of stress for them giving us better visibility into their current situation overall many of our customers are in positions of financial strength have high liquidity collateral value and equity and have made the business changes necessary to adapt to the new environment however due to the shutdowns some businesses experienced an the broad impact of the global pandemic on consumer behavior we downgraded a small percentage of these loans that we review overall the increase in criticized loans was primarily from the oil and gas industry these loan reviews were in addition to our normal loan review practices and we will continue this heightened iterative process for the duration of the credit cycle continue on slide we show a detailed breakdown of our ci loan portfolio ci loans excluding ppp were billion as of june or of total loans as you can see our portfolio is well diversified by industry our oil and gas exposure as of june was billion of loans outstanding and billion of total commitment from march until july our total oil and gas commitments decreased by following the spring borrowing base redetermination period as well as through exits of certain worker loans now within the ep portfolio of our ep clients oil production is hedged for and is hedged for furthermore of their gas production is hedged for and is hedged for as of june the allowance for loan losses coverage of our oil and gas portfolio was we feel comfortable with this level of reserve for potential losses especially in light of current commodity prices which have recovered from their trough moving on to slide as of june our cre portfolio was billion equivalent to of total loans the portfolio is well balanced across the major property types of retail multifamily office industrial and hotel the geographic distribution of our portfolio generally reflects our branch footprint and as of june owneroccupied cre was billion equivalent to of total loans or of total cre loans east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 including unfunded commitments our total exposure to construction and land loan is small at under billion our construction portfolio is well diversified by property type with a weighted average loan to value of a low based on total commitment you can see on slide that the weighted average loan to value of our total cre portfolio was with an average loan size of million nearly of our cre loans have an loan to value of of loan in the chart on the right you can see that the weighted average loan to value of our loans are similar by property type our history of consistent underwriting to low loan to value has resulted in low credit losses through many credit cycles in our incomeproducing cre portfolios furthermore a high percentage of our cre loans have full recourse and personal guarantees from borrowers who have longterm relationships with east west bank on slide and we provide additional details regarding our singlefamily residential and heloc loans on slide you can see that the geographic distribution of our singlefamily residential mortgage portfolio follows our branch footprint our singlefamily residential mortgages are primarily originated through our east west bank branches the average loan size in our sfr portfolio is only and the weighted average loan to value is more than of our loans have an loan to value of or less we have a long history of minimal credit losses from our singlefamily mortgages in the second quarter we originate a combined million of residential mortgage loans comprising million in singlefamily mortgages and million in the home equity lines of credit the combined second quarter residential mortgage origination volume increased quarteroverquarter production dipped in april but regained pace in may and june in fact residential mortgage production in june was the strongest on record for east west bank contributing factors to the growth were increases in heloc originations and in refinance transactions in the second quarter refinance transactions increased to of volume compared to in the first quarter based on the current pipelines we expect strong residential mortgage origination volumes for the rest of the year on slide you can see the geographic distribution and the loantovalue distribution of our heloc portfolio similar to singlefamily residential mortgage our heloc are primarily originated through east west bank branches as of june we have billion of helocs outstanding plus billion in undisbursed commitments translating into a utilization rate of at east west the heloc we originate are very similar in credit profile to our sfr loans as of june were in a first lien position for of our helocs the average loan size of our heloc commitment was and the weighted average combined loan to values was only of our heloc commitments have a loan to value of under lastly i would highlight that the rates of singlefamily origination have been fairly stable the weighted average yield in the second quarter was compared to in the first quarter first lien heloc rates are priced at the prime rate plus a margin of basis point i will now turn the call over to irene for a more detailed discussion of our allowances and asset quality deposit and income statement irene east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 irene h oh executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thank you dominic turning to slide for a review of our allowance for loan losses and slide for a review of ph other asset quality metrics our allowance for loan losses was million as of june or of loans held for investment compared to million or of loans as of march quarteroverquarter the allowance coverage of the oil and gas portfolio increased by basis points to the coverage of all other ci increased by basis points to and the coverage of cre increased by basis points to driven by increases in reserves for hotel and retail commercial real estate loans during the second quarter of we booked a million provision for credit losses compared to million in the first quarter the quarteroverquarter increase in the provision expense was primarily driven by a more adverse macroeconomic forecast as of june relative to march as well as loan risk rating downgrades during the quarter all else equal as the macroeconomic outlook stabilizes we would expect the provision expense to decrease from current levels as you will see on the next slide excluding oil and gas loans we are not seeing significant deterioration in our portfolio by any particular industry or asset class the low loan to values of our real estate portfolio provide a buffer against losses and the rate of deferrals remain manageable net chargeoffs in the second quarter were just under million and the net chargeoff ratio was basis points of average loans annualized chargeoffs in the second quarter were primarily from oil and gas which accounted for million or of gross chargeoffs turning to slide criticized loans were of total loans as of june or billion you can see from the chart on the slide that the largest single industry component of our criticized loans are oil and gas loans nearly equal size to the criticized loans of all other ci oil and gas loans made up of our special mention loans and of our classified loans as of june special mention loans were of total loans as of june or million this ratio was stable quarterover quarter of our oil and gas loans were graded special mention as of june up from as of march for all other ci cre and residential mortgage loans the special mention ratio was essentially stable quarterover quarter classified loans were of total loans as of june in the amount of million compared to a ratio of as of march the quarteroverquarter increase in classified loans was largely driven by downgrades of oil and gas loans the classified percentage of our oil and gas loans was as of june up from as of march for all other ci loans the classified loan ratio improved from to quarteroverquarter outside of oil and gas the rest of our ci loan portfolio remained stable as evidenced by these asset quality ratios as well as by the low deferral rate of our ci loans the classified loan ratio for commercial real estate was as of june up from as of march the largest inflow into classified commercial real estate in the second quarter were from office and retail cre segments the classified ratio of residential mortgages was essentially stable quarteroverquarter nonaccrual loans were basis points of total loans or million as of june the quarteroverquarter increase was largely due to inflows of nonaccrual status of oil and gas and commercial real estate loans partially offset by payoffs and chargeoffs of ci loans lastly accruing loans to days past due were basis points of total loans or million as of june east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 now moving on to slide for a discussion of deposits total deposits grew to a record billion as of june an increase of billion or linked quarter annualized average deposits of billion grew billion or linked quarter annualized growth in average noninterestbearing demand deposits was billion quarteroverquarter or an impressive linked quarter annualized average ddas increased to of total deposits in the second quarter up from in the first quarter average deposit growth in the second quarter was driven by strong growth from consumer and small business commercial customers as well as from ppp funds held in deposit accounts partially offset by intentional runoff of highercost deposits we attribute this growth to customers choosing to remain very liquid in this environment and to lower levels of business spending during these shutdown periods while we expect customer liquidity to remain elevated during the course of the pandemic we also expect balances to trend down as business and consumer activity resumes during the second quarter we also intentionally reduced some highercost deposits giving the strong growth in deposits the average total cost of deposits was basis points in the second quarter and the spot rate as of june was basis points the average cost of interestbearing deposits was basis points in the second quarter and the spot rate as of june was basis points we expect to continue to decrease deposit costs for the rest of the year from the repricing downward of maturing cds as well as from further runoffs of highercost balances as of june spot rate on domestic cds was further maturities of cds with the interest rate over are billion in the third quarter at a blended rate of billion in the fourth quarter at a blended rate of and billion in the first quarter of at a blended rate of for context the blended rate of cd originations and renewals in the second quarter was basis points and now moving on to a discussion of our income statement starting with slide i will share highlights not discussed in detail elsewhere during this presentation on this slide we purchased investment securities during the market dislocation earlier in the quarter and sold million of municipal bonds for a gain on sale of million we also prepaid million of repo liabilities to help improve our future funding costs incurring a debt extinguishment cost of million during the second quarter the effective tax rate was unchanged at for both the second and the first quarter moving on to slide for a discussion of our net interest income and net interest margin second quarter net interest income of million decreased by million or linked quarter and the net interest margin of compressed by basis points from the prior quarter second quarter net interest income included million of ppp loan income net of interest expense on the ppplf excluding this ppprelated income second quarter net interest margin was the changes in the net interest income and the net interest margin reflect a quarteroverquarter drop in the average prime and libor rates of our loan portfolio is tied to libor predominantly the onemonth rate and of our loan portfolio is tied to prime accordingly the average loan yields in our portfolio compressed by basis points quarteroverquarter to in the second quarter from in the first quarter against the backdrop of materially lower interest rates declines in earning asset yields were partially offset by decreases in the cost of funds the quarteroverquarter change in our net interest margin is as follows 65basispoint decrease from lower loan yields 10basispoint decrease from lower yields on other earning assets an basis points decrease from balance sheet mix shift all of which were partially offset by a 35basispoint increase from lower funding costs east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 and a positive impact of basis points from ppp we expect that our net interest margin excluding the variability from recognition of ppp loan fees will stabilize around current levels in the neighborhood of our loan portfolio has largely already repriced and the repricing was frontloaded into the second quarter the yields on residential mortgage loan originations have been more resilient to rate compression and as dominic mentioned loan pipelines are rebuilding which will continue and contribute to a favorable earning asset ph remix we expect to continue to improve our cost of deposits with the downward repricing of cds to current market rates as well now turning to slide total noninterest income in the second quarter was million compared to million in the first quarter the income and net gains on sales of loans were million in the second quarter down by million or quarteroverquarter this decrease reflects lower customer transaction volume across several fee income lines of business in other fee income categories lending fees of million in the second quarter increased by million primarily due to increase in the valuation of warrants received as part of lending relationships moving on to slide second quarter noninterest expense was million an increase of linked quarter excluding debt extinguishment cost for the repos amortization of tax credit and other investments and the core deposit intangible amortization our adjusted noninterest expense was million in the second quarter a decrease of quarteroverquarter and a decrease of yearoveryear the largest linkedquarter change was a million decrease in compensation and employee benefits expense followed by a million decrease in other operating expenses and a million decrease in legal expense notable decreases in other operating expenses include marketing promotion expenses and travel expenses our second quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was over the past five quarters our efficiency ratio has ranged from to as an organization we remain committed to controlling expenses across the board with that ill now turn the call back to dominic for closing remarks dominic ng chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you irene ph well this has been a quarter like no other given not only tough economic conditions but also the toughest of health and social circumstances im proud of the way our associates have handled the challenge and delivered for our clients exemplifying east west values and culture as an organization we remained vigilant about credit risk management and maintaining a strong balance sheet with above peers capital ratios we are committed to delivering responsible growth managing controllable expenses and building sustainable profitability i will now open up the call to questions operator east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question today comes from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc indiscernible dominic thanks for going through all the details on credit but if you could just spend some more time there after the review that you talked about can you talk to us just in terms of the downside risks to your reserve levels when we think about one the energy portfolio we saw one of the banks take a mark and sell some of these loans so if you could address your energy book in the context of that and then also on the cre book like if the ltvs which looked relatively low are those a good kind of buffer when we think about certain hospitality properties that may never recover from this pandemic give us a sense of your comfort around both of those portfolios if you could please dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc okay first on the oil and gas when you we i mean i cant really comment much about hancock whitney because our portfolio quite different to a certain extent and why the motivation of selling at such a steep discount wed done pretty much most of our spring redetermination we do not see the type of deficiency like that will be causing us to wanted to take this kind of massive discount and basically we are going through just loan by loan and looking at the current situation and most updated financial information and the engineering reports from the spring redetermination and come up with the reserve that is needed we feel that we have very adequate very adequately cover our oil and gas portfolio as of today with the of reserve coverage so we feel pretty good on that and we have appropriately classified the loans that need to be classified and so forth now lets go to the cre yes the 50someoddpercent loan to value is very i think is very good in terms of as a cushion to help against losses we have years of history at east west in many different credit cycles that year in and year out when it comes to incomeproducing properties the low loan to value makes a big difference i think for the hotels it also add that we are doing business with hotel operators that are very experienced in this trade and these are highquality operator and also many of them have substantial liquidity many of them also have put in their personal guarantee so yes there are some hotels that is going to be having some challenge because of the current pandemic that causing the occupancy rate dropping very low but the fact is so far what we have seen is that some of these hotels have gradually reopened east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 i know that there are going to be always some setback with certain state and certain cities that may have to shut down for a brief period of time eventually the economy has to open up we just have to find ways to protect ourselves while still working so i would expect that some of these hotels will gradually still open back up and we do have our borrowers who have more liquidity and have their personal financial net worth at stake that i think will be substantially more motivated so from that standpoint we want to look at pretty much almost all of the hotel loans and we do feel pretty comfortable right now that we have more than adequate reserve to cover the commercial real estate portfolio operator thank you the next question comes from jared shaw of wells fargo please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning i guess for the first question sticking with credit when we look at some of the most troubled i guess cre loans whether thats hotels or retail or restaurants how are you looking at sort of the longterm resolution of that should we assume that those just stay on sort of a continued deferral thats allowed under the cares act or would you expect to see more of an active restructuring of the most troubled loans before year end and try to get them onto a new system or a new structure dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well first of all i think that as i mentioned earlier over of our payment deferrals are actually only three months so based on our conversation with the customers the one that request the deferral really dont anticipate that they would need another three months or six months deferral and so forth at this stage ph while granted some of them have support from ppp loans so well have to see whether beyond the ppp what the stimulus package that may be coming from the government or maybe some of them possibly qualify for the main street lending program and so forth so there are many different sources of support but all in all when i look at particular for the hotel and some of the retail customers when we go through loan by loan so many of them did not even ask for payment deferral keep in mind though vast majority if you look at it only of our cre customer asked for payment deferral the vast majority of our customers dont even need that because they have their personal liquidity or for whatever reason the nature of that particular incomeproducing property allow them to still have enough cash flow to service their debt and thats the beauty about having first trust deed low loantovalue loan because the mortgage payment for pi combined are not as taxing as those what i call conventional borrowers who borrow and struggling a little bit so i think from that standpoint that theres no question that were going to have a few more customers potentially may have to come back due to whatever various reason that we have to do maybe somewhat of a additional modification and well work with them one by one but at this stage right now i think overall its looking pretty good for us jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks and then on the ci loan pipeline last quarter you seemed i guess a little more cautious on growth this quarter it sounds like the pipelines are starting to boost again how are you looking at underwriting in this east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 environment and i guess whats the what do you view as the opportunity for nearterm ci growth as we finish up the year here dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah i think ever since in fact ever since late january when the pandemic first happened in wuhan we have implement internally the covid19 review every single loan that we approved had to go through the sort of like evaluation about how does covid19 affect this particular business so that in addition to looking at the like for example like back in february and march or so in addition just looking at the financial statement as of and then everything looks fine and dandy we look at the situation as it and say that hey with the pandemic how would this business going to be able to carry on in the next months months do they have enough liquidity to get by are they in a business that actually are benefiting from the pandemic because theyre in the ecommerce business or they are in some type of business they are making face mask that actually are helping them so we look at all of the different factors or if theres something that is positive to what extent this positivity can only last for six months and so forth so we look at all of those different factors to determine that the credit worthiness and making sure that we do not go in here now and going to make a loan using a formula precovid and then end up getting ourself in more problem a few months down the road so thats the kind of a vigor that we use and so far i think that we find business that we are able to sort of like bring in as new customers and we also have existing customers now start going back and doing more business and we continue to support this type of endeavors operator thank you the next question comes from ken zerbe of morgan stanley please go ahead ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks i guess my first question for irene can you just help us understand the benefit of the ppp loans this quarter because if i look at the math you have billion of loans but you have million of fees or income which kind of amounts to about a annualized yield which seems a bit high help us understand that please irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc sure id be delighted to do that for you so if you look at the million of ppprelated loan income that is the one part of it is the that were accruing and additional we estimated what we thought the life would be for the ppp loans loan by loan and based on that we have accreted part of that fee income during the quarter so the combination of that is the million so ill break that down for you the amount that we accreted was about million in the second quarter so were estimating that that the life of the loans will be shorter than the contractual periods which for us is generally two years in total for some of the loans some of them just based on the activity and what were seeing and what we know about the customers we are assuming that theyll go through the full contractual life of the two years plus ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 got it so in essence that if you assume a loan has say a sixmonth life and you got fee on that loan youre basically taking the entire fee over the sixmonth period is that the right way to understand that irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thats correct ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay and if i can just speak sort of a second question just in terms of provision expense irene you did mention that provision expense should decline which i think we all generally agree provision expense should decline if theres no further deterioration to your macroeconomic assumptions but is there anything unique about east west that would lead that provision to decline a little bit less or more or im just trying to get a magnitude of whether it goes from million down to million or million down to million if theres no further deterioration irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah thats a great question i dont know if you look at it portfolio by portfolio i dont know if there are any kind of unique characteristics and thats why our relative to others with the same macroeconomic environment we use moodys the baseline as the backbone of our allowance calculation would be that different from other banks quite frankly i do think kind of in continuation of the comments that weve made as far as the resiliency of our customers incomeproducing commercial real estate the reviews that weve done the singlefamily customers the amount of equity that they have those are portfolios im very confident that ultimately the loss content will be reasonable reasonably low relative to others but i dont know if aside from the oil and gas which weve talked about we see anything really systemic at this point operator thank you the next question comes from michael young of suntrust please go ahead michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey thanks for taking the question maybe just a quick followup on that point irene just sort of the ci portfolio i think youve got a little over reserve on the remaining loans ex oil and gas can you talk about what areas you are watching more closely in there whether it be entertainment and whats in that bucket or tech and life sciences or are there other things that we should be keeping an eye out for as it does seem like those might be the higher loss given the following areas irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah candidly speaking i think we are looking at all the portfolios especially with the pandemic the concerns the cash flows the different circumstances are very different than before the pandemic so were looking at as far as whats happening with our business whats the cash flow strength of the guarantors and the borrowers as well from an allowance perspective specifically i dont think that aside from oil and gas if you look at industry by industry theres anything very unique with how much ph we reserved there are certain portfolios east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 for example we have a equipment leasing portfolio its a longer life the amount of reserve for that is higher but aside from that i wouldnt say that theres anything very unique industry wise michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and this one may be a bit of a indiscernible question but kind of just bigger picture on whats going on with hong kong right now china and us rhetoric ratcheting up again are there any things that we should be thinking about relative to kind of the hong kong specific or china mainland operations that could flow back through to east west if things were to deteriorate there dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well i think on the hong kong situation let me just maybe see if we can break it out into a few different scenario lets just say the worstcase scenario the worstcase scenario will be lets say that us government order all us banks to retreat back to us and no longer allowed to be doing business or no longer allowed to have offices in hong kong or something like that thats what i look at as the worstcase scenario well keep in mind that we have so far as of today only of our loans are in greater china region so for example you look at billion of loan outstanding today only billion is in greater china thats even including hong kong so you kept that half of that in hong kong knowing that china and hong kong combined half of that in hong kong so we like talking about less than or so of our total loan portfolio and if you look at our history for the last years in hong kong the loss rate delinquency nonperforming asset and so forth has been extraordinary low so as of today if we look at whats been happening hong kong went through the pandemic for six months and we had no losses so i feel pretty good that if we end up just having to all come back home were talking about a revenue risk its very minimal we obviously just last quarter grew our loans by annualized so theres really no reason for us to worry about a loan reduction so we feel pretty good about even if the worstcase scenario were not going to have any losses or were going to and on top of revenue risk we can get it covered but that is an extremely extremely unlikely scenario because i looked at it hong kong in when there was the handover of hong kong from the british government to china after years of hong kong being colonized by england and the fact is everyone in was concerned about that was the end of hong kong singapore had picked up a lot of business vancouver toronto sydney to melbourne all picked up new business and everyone think that everyones going to be gone and no longer hong kong is no longer going to be viable i didnt think so i was there at the handover ceremony had some discussion with many different business leaders around the world and while some of them had pessimistic view there are many other have optimistic view at the end of the day since hong kong have done extraordinarily well and so from my perspective is that the more likely scenario is that were going to have to see some noises within the next to months and hong kong will be different in the standpoint of now there may be not as much the business that hong kong is currently doing like that will be doing in the future but theyre connecting with the greater bay of china the southern provinces of china connecting to hong kong is going to create enormous amount opportunity for hong kong if you look at ph ant financial indiscernible a few of these over billion are potential ipo therell be more and more of those going to hong kong so hong kong is still going to have a place and if i look at our existing customers for the last several months by the way most of them actually have their business headquartered in the british virgin islands and then a type of entity anyway and they were navigating through east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 this challenging time in hong kong just fine and we are continuing to work with private equity funds audio gap for them to move to singapore and then other places it will be very easy so i dont think that there will be that big of a challenge from a business point of view but theres no question theres no question that the political noise will continue to be a major distraction because no matter what if every day that you read the newspaper what you see is the headline news about something terrible happening in hong kong and so forth it does have a perception risk there that we have to recognize but as you have seen so far for the last two or three years whether in china on the tariff situation east west navigate through the last three years with this heavy uschina political bash regarding the tariff and somehow we navigate through and have very minimal losses and continue to be able to maintain our business and going forward and were going to be nimble and were going to be pretty flexible and whenever there is some business caused by the political risk that we should no longer engage we move forward to other business that is appropriate for us to do and i wanted to do highlight one other thing is that as all these political rhetorics thats going on for the last few years in fact in the last six months it intensified substantially and i would expect that there will be more more months to go before it subside and with these political rhetorics that is going on us investment in china for the last six months actually had increased the media dont talk about it much but if you look at the true statistics foreign direct investment from united states to china have actually increased business folks still see the potential of still investing in china in fact china is still welcoming us business as you can see what they have done for tesla or jpmorgan mastercard i mean they continue to welcome us business to china and those business are continue to taking advantage of those new licenses they were able to acquire or the new acquisition they can make and so its a very interesting dynamic in terms of the political rhetorics versus whats happening in terms of the daytoday business and east west bank are apolitical we stay neutral and were focusing on taking care of our business our clients and we know how to manage risk because we understand the space very very well so so far so good so we will continue to do what we need to do in terms of managing the overall risk profile of this uschina relationship and move accordingly in a prudent manner so i feel pretty comfortable that were able to find a way to keep doing well and its something that i have plenty of discussion with our board of directors in regarding with this situation again i think that since nixons normalized relationship with china and us government policy have always been seek common ground and reverse reserving differences thats been the policy for a few decades and the last few months have been quite differently but i dont think that this sort of like very very hostile type of relationship can sustain and at some point of time in my longterm view it will normalize again and then things will get better operator thank you the next question comes from chris mcgratty of kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for the question dominic in your prepared remarks you spoke of the consistency of your efficiency ratio in the high understand you were in a different world with interest rates maybe you could talk about your expectations for this metric going forward and maybe speak of it excluding the impact of the ppp program thank you east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well efficiency i mean i think i said it before efficiency ratio is just a sort of the revenue ph of income minus expenses so theres not much to it i just basically work with our associate and then i tell them that hey we i mean dont take any losses but then book as many loans as you can and then bring in all these good lowcost deposits and so that generate some meaningful like a net interest income and then get more fee income core fee income and then control the expenses and then something good will come out and then my definition of something good come out is that these high low kind of numbers and thats it thats all we thats what we focus on and then i dont really really get into that much about we have a target anything like that i just we just make sure we do the right thing christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc understood great maybe i could ask one more on the expenses you guys have i think done a great job adjusting to the revenue environment by slowing the expense growth i guess twopart question the lower expenses the core expenses this quarter was there any benefit from the ppp program the originations and two how do we think about just investments in this kind of environment the pace of investments into thank you irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc chris this is irene ill take that yes there was a benefit during the quarter for loan costs that were deferred our gross fees are roughly million in the quarter we deferred about million of the loan cost fees associated with the origination of the ppp loans on a goforward basis if you look at the pace of investment we have actually many very exciting investments and projects underway to help our customers improving our systems our platforms the digital onboarding those investments started before the pandemic and are underway just to share well underway rather were implementing a new online banking system for hong kong and that will integrate our us online banking and our hong kong online banking were also implementing a new global fx system and we also have many smaller projects underway to improve digital onboarding endtoend processes i think with the pandemic the investments that we have been and continue to make in these areas are perhaps maybe even more important so to a certain extent these are things that were continuing to do have started before and well continue to do and in a way many of these will also help us as far as the efficiency and the productivity of our teams and our ability to continue to serve our customers without adding on as much incremental cost operator thank you the next question comes from lana chan of bmo capital markets please go ahead lana chan q analyst bmo capital markets corp thanks just two questions one is there any update on the tax credit investments and the associated tax rate going forward east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc updates theres no update if youre asking what the amortization the tax credit will be for the full year we are assuming around million sorry to clarify were assuming million of tax credits with a tax rate amortization and indiscernible against those million lana chan q analyst bmo capital markets corp got it thank you and is there any way you can quantify the reserve build this quarter how much of it was associated with the change in economic forecast versus loan downgrades and new loan growth irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question first and foremost i would say the vast majority of it on a kind of there are a lot of moving parts with the allowance the vast majority of the increase had to do with the more adverse economic scenario secondarily i would say its the downgrades particularly for ci operator the next question comes from dave rochester of compass point please go ahead david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc on the credit slide on slide youre showing classified and special mention in ci ex energy and ppp going down this quarter in terms of the ratio versus last quarter i was just looking for some color there was that the ppp effect shoring up customer balance sheets or something else going on just little color there would be great irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah its definitely not the ppp what we had in the quarteroverquarter there were some loans that were resolved during the quarter that were classified last quarter east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc got it and then for my second question you guys had mentioned pipelines were building in june in commercial and you mentioned a few industries there was just wondering if you could just talk about whats driving that build if youre taking share in those areas or if youre hearing more confidence or any positive sentiment amongst commercial customers and then i guess on the flip side in the rest of the ci book is the expectation that youll have some more paydowns in energy and maybe see an unwind of some of those draws from the first quarter as we go through the back half of this year dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc okay for the pipeline that we are beginning to see in june in fact we start booking some of these loans now in july in pe private equity those are just traditional capital call lines and mainly existing customers that have new funds so much distress situation going around the world there are more people now i mean just like putting in substantial amount of liquidity and start new funds to capitalize on these opportunities and we have these very very strong borrowers that are starting new funds coming to us and we are able to actually start booking some of these private equity capital call line business we just happen to be picking up some more i think for the last few weeks versus in the second quarter when people need to just time out and size up whats going on and on the entertainment side i think our team just being very diligent while staying at home but dialing the phone nonstop with the studio executives and then getting these deals that we are able to finance and again very strong collateral support type of deals and things that we sort of like without any question to be more than happy to jump into this kind of type of transaction and even during the pandemic so we feel very good about it these kind of opportunities and the third category that i thought we saw some nice pickup ph our crossborder business keep in mind that in the first and second quarter hong kong and china have taken a more draconian type of measurement against in terms of i would say discipline on fighting the pandemic both of them have been extraordinarily successful but with that i think that obviously business been somewhat shut down in a big way so they werent having as much business as you as we indicated in the second quarter of no second quarter we actually have million the reduction of our greater china loan portfolio but they started getting back business as usual business as normal both in hong kong and china and so our teams in greater china are picking up some more business we feel that there is more opportunities there and same thing for the crossborder team in united states frankly when everybody look at uschina as something that they dont want to get anywhere close to if someone just look very hard and deep they can always find some golden opportunity in there and were trying to make sure that we do the best we can to capitalize on some of these remaining good opportunity so at this point we see these three industry verticals may have some pretty good traction for now i mean but still we are in july and still early so we dont know what the next two months will be like well see but at this point it looks pretty promising operator thank you east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc whats the next question operator the next question comes from david chiaverini of wedbush securities please go ahead david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks first question is on credit and the provision you mentioned about how it could be lower if the macro environment remains stable i was curious if the stimulus bill being contemplated is delayed to late august or september would that change your economic forecast irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc i dont know if just the stimulus bill being delayed would change the economic forecast certainly if it impacts the expectation a lot of the drivers for our forecast some of the there are many drivers but for us if you look at it gdp growth unemployment and then to a certain extent for singlefamily the housing starts numbers so those are the things that drive it the most but certainly i would say that if the bills are delayed and that impacts the expectation around these key metrics that that would have an impact but not just by itself david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thanks for that and separately anecdotally it appears more retail stores are becoming vacant i was curious do you know how much of your cre borrowers no longer have tenants dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well we actually went through the cre retail customers loan review as i said we review over of these cre loans in a loanbyloan review basis and getting the most current information our relationship manager actually have the most updated information for the customers every one of them have a maybe a little bit unique situation we have some that have maybe of the tenants have to cannot pay full rent and we have some that actually have a few of the tenant just say that im out and then there were others that are still paying us and really fully occupied so every one of them are a bit different for a few of them that may have some more severity in terms of tenant not paying somehow the borrowers have strong financial ability to continue to carry the payment and knowing that eventually he will be able to find a way to release it to some other new tenants down the road so it just a multiple different scenario but one thing we do know is that because we went through this review loan by loan we know exactly what the situation is and we know what the stress situation is currently and at this stage we feel pretty good and comfortable about the portfolio where it stand today and we feel that we absolutely from a cre point of view we have more than adequate reserve to cover any potential losses irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 id also just like to add a lot of the comments dominic made were about tenants and their payments and especially given in light that many of the stores are closed specifically as it relates to occupancy of the buildings most of as we went through these loan reviews the occupancy prepandemic was pretty high on most of the properties most of them were fully occupied operator thank you the next question comes from brock vandervliet of ubs please go ahead brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc oh thanks just an accounting question here i noticed there was a negative provision in singlefamily residential in the quarter could you kind of give some color around that please irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah the slight negative provision in singlefamily its very modest in many ways but the results the reason for that was the allowance that was required did reduce slightly from the forecast that we used at the end of march to our forecast as of the end of june that we use for our june allowance close it was really driven by the less severe impact for housing prices with the hpi improving over the prior forecast brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it got it okay and did i understand correctly that the next major cliff of deferral expiries is august irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah based on so ill categorize the deferrals we have the big groups as far as the commercial deferrals and then also the singlefamily singlefamily a little earlier for the commercial deferrals it is august and september most of those will come up in a way then operator thank you this does conclude our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference call back over to
