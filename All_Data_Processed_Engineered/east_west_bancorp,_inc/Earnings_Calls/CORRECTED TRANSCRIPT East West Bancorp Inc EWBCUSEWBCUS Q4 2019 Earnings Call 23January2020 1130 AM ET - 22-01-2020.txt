profitability reflect the strength of our diverse business model which is the foundation for continued solid financial performance for years to come in we earned a return on assets of a return on equity of and a return on tangible equity of this is the fifth consecutive year of a return on tangible equity above on slide you can see the five quarter trend in our ratios our profitability was once again strong in the fourth quarter our fourth quarter return on assets was return on equity was and a return on tangible equity was moving to slide our loan portfolio is well balanced between commercial commercial real estate and residential mortgage loans over the past years we steadily made investments in people and our infrastructure building specialized commercial lending verticals expanding our crossborder capabilities and broadening our lending solutions this has resulted in a diversified platform capable of generating above industry organic loan growth yearin yearout east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 as of december total loans reached a record billion an increase of billion or as i mentioned earlier full year average loans of billion grew billion or over last year by portfolio residential mortgage grew yearoveryear commercial real estate and ci both grew by in dollar terms loan growth was evenly distributed across the three sectors which all grew just over billion each for the fourth quarter of average loans of billion grew by linked quarter annualized we saw very strong growth from commercial real estate which increased by million or linked quarter annualized followed by residential mortgage which increased by million or linked quarter annualized in fact the fourth quarter of was the best quarter in the history of east west in terms of singlefamily residential mortgage originations average commercial loan grew by million or quarter annualized and with that i will move on to review our outlook indiscernible page apologize for that let me go back to my script in order the average loan growth of in was achieved in the challenging environment including three interest rate cut by the federal reserve a slowing economy and an ongoing us china trade tension that started to escalate in and remained high throughout the past year at east west the headwinds from the uschina trade tensions are most easily visible in our wholesale trade portfolio which typically shows seasonally strong growth in the fourth quarter instead last year we saw a decrease in commitment of and a decrease in loan outstanding of yearoveryear as of december of we have commitments of billion and loans outstanding of billion in a wholesale trade portfolio however what is less visible is the focus and active management of our commercial loan portfolio throughout and over the course of the past two years where we could actively reduce credit exposures particularly to customers were higher direct or indirect tariff related credit risks largely concentrated in the wholesale trade and manufacturing importantly we have experienced only one chargeoff related trade tariff and it was less than million east west is starting the new decade with confidence knowing that our portfolio is better positioned and stronger today and we are ready to support our customers as the geopolitical backdrop improves with the signing of the partial trade agreement on january we believe that there is more clarity surrounding the uschina trade dispute in addition our customers have adapted to the new normal of uschina relations in terms of their operations and costs over the past two years and reduced tariffs uncertainty and geopolitical volatility should only allow them to resume growth this clarity should have a positive impact for east west in particular for our ability to grow our crossborder loans and expand our crossborder customer relationships the value of their expertise that our crossborder bankers bring to the table has only increased receiving new interest from chinese loans exploring direct foreign investments or evaluating expansion opportunities in the united states in the manufacturing energy or service sectors furthermore the expected increase in purchase of us manufactured goods by china provides crossborder trade expansion opportunity for our customers also now more than ever the need for us based business to develop a china strategy and understand the chinese market dynamics is vital east west is wellpositioned to take advantage of the evolving nature of the uschina crossborder business and we are confident about our ability to expand both our commercial and consumer market share in this sector in and future years for the full year our current outlook for end of period loans is growth of to we expect that to grow in will come from across all of our major loan portfolios of commercial real estate residential mortgage and ci east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 now moving onto slide for a discussion of deposits as of december our end of period loanto deposit ratio was as we have previously stated we have comfortable operating with a loantodeposit ratio in the range of to total deposit grew to a record billion as of december an increase of billion or yearoveryear full year average deposit of billion grew billion or from average deposit growth for the full year primarily came from growth in time deposits and interestbearing checking partially offset by a decrease in noninterestbearing demand accounts thats happened in the first quarter of last year in fact after declining in the first quarter due to a shift to interestbearing checking for certain customer balances our noninterestbearing demand deposits steadily grew quarteroverquarter in the second third and fourth quarters for the fourth quarter average deposit of billion grew by linked quarter annualized after which deposit growth in the fourth quarter was led by growth in interestbearing checking which is seasonally strong in fourth quarter for some commercial customers followed growth in noninterest bearing deposit demand and money market accounts partially offset by a decrease in average time deposits as we actively reduce higher cost deposits the fourth quarter average cost of deposit decreased by basis points linked quarter to and the average cost of interestbearing deposit decreased by 15basispoint to accelerating the pace of decrease from the third quarter as of december the end of period cost of deposits was down by 11basispoint from at the end of third quarter the end of period cost of our interestbearing deposit was as of december 31st down by 15basispoint from as of september im pleased to note that since the fed began cutting the fed funds rate in july we achieved a reduction in the cost of deposits across all of our major deposit types while at the same time also growing noninterest bearing demand balances i will now turn the call over to irene for a more detailed discussion of our fourth quarter financial results and our outlook for irene h oh executive vice president and chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thank you dominic on page we have a slide that shows a summary income statement and a snapshot of tax related and notable items during the quarter for the fourth quarter we reported diluted eps of and adjusted eps of our tax expense in the fourth quarter was million and our effective tax rate was this compares to a tax expense of million and an effective tax rate of in the third quarter the decrease in the fourth quarter tax rate relative to third quarter resulted from additional tax cut investments indiscernible of previous years tax

adjusted full year tax expense was million and the effective tax rate was compared to a tax expense of million and an effective tax rate of for the full year in our outlook for we project that our effective tax rate will be moving onto the discussion of net interest income on page fourth quarter net interest income of million decreased by million or linked quarter the fourth quarter gaap net interest margin was a contraction of basis points from the prior quarter the quarteroverquarter change in our gaap net interest east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 margin is as follows a basis point decrease from lower loan yields a basis point decrease from lower yields on other interest on other interest earning assets including investment securities a basis point decrease from the asset mix shift and a net increase in investment securities all of which were partially offset by an basis points increase to the net interest margin from the lower cost of funds asc discount accretion was million in the fourth quarter higher quarteroverquarter due to recoveries and added basis points to the net interest margin the fourth quarter adjusted net interest margin excluding the impact of discount accretion was in the third quarter discount accretion income was million which added basis points to the net interest margin as of december the accretable portion of the asc discount accretion was million and the impact of accretion on our net interest income and our net interest margin in and beyond is expected to be immaterial as such we will no longer separately report the asc discount accretion in our outlook we expect that the gap net interest margin will range between to this translates to a stable margin relative to our fourth quarter adjusted net interest margin of in our interest rate outlook we assume that the fed funds rate will be unchanged in a tailwind to our margin supporting our nim outlook for is a nearterm repricing benefit of our maturing time deposits in the first quarter of we had billion of time deposits maturing at a weighted average rate of and in the second quarter of we have another billion maturing at a weighted average rate of for comparison in the fourth quarter of we originated or renewed billion of time deposits at a weighted average interest rate of down from a weighted average interest rate of in the third quarter of for new and renewing time deposits for your reference we inserted slide which provides the underlying interest rate detail of our loan portfolio our fourth quarter average loan yield of declined by basis points linked quarter our loan portfolio is largely variable rate and the most impactful interest rate indices for our loans are the prime rate in one month libor now

increase of quarteroverquarter the largest change quarteroverquarter was a million increase in compensation expense which was million in the fourth quarter our fourth quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was compared to in the third quarter over the past five quarters our industry leading adjusted efficiency ratio has been under our full year noninterest expense was million and excluding amortization of tax credit investments and cdi it was million an increase of yearoveryear east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 our full year adjusted efficiency ratio was compared to in the increase in noninterest expense for the full year compared to was largely driven by an increase in compensation expense reflecting hires throughout the year to add talented bankers to our frontline and to ensure that we continue to strengthen our risk management and support functions additionally in and continuing in we have been making ongoing and important investments in technology to better serve our commercial and consumer customers and to grow our market share in well be launching a new fx system and a new commercial digital banking platform in hong kong which will provide our customers enhanced crossborder payment and assets hedging capabilities as well as better interactivity with our domestic commercial digital banking platform furthermore we are continuing to build a new consumer digital banking platform tailored to the distinct needs of our consumer customer base inclusive of these investments and new systems and platforms and other ongoing efforts to invest in our business our outlook for assumes operating expense growth of excluding amortization of tax credit investments and core deposits and intangibles this is similar to the rate of operating expense growth in in slide of the presentation we detail our critical asset quality metrics our allowance for loan losses totaled million as of december or of loans held for investment compared to as of september and basis points as of december nonperforming assets as of december were million or basis points of total assets compared to basis points of total assets as of september and basis points of total assets as of december for the fourth quarter of our net chargeoffs were million or annualized basis points of average loans and we reported a provision for credit losses of million this compares to net chargeoffs of million or annualized basis points of average loans and a provision for credit losses of million in the third quarter of included in the fourth quarter net chargeoffs of ci loans which totaled million was an million full recover on a ci loan as well as a million chargeoff on an energy loan that had been placed on nonaccrual status earlier in the year other ci chargeoffs in the fourth quarter came from loans that were also previously on nonaccrual status and these have largely been reserved for as of september for the full year netcharge offs were million or basis points of average loans compared to basis points in full year provision for credit losses was million compared to million in overall asset quality continues to be stable quarter over quarter nonperforming assets and net chargeoffs decreased as of december classified and criticized assets totaled million compared to million as of september currently we estimate that the day one cecl related increase to our allowance for loan losses will be an increase of approximately from the allowance for credit losses as of december our current outlook for projects that the day two provision for credit losses will range between million and million for this reflects our projected loan growth and our view that asset quality should be broadly similar in as in further the range of our provision outlook also takes into account the volatility that we expect to see a result of the forecast changes during that will drive the cecl model moving onto capital ratios on slide east west capital ratios are strong tangible equity per share of as of december grew linked quarter and grew by year over year the tangible equity to tangible east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript

declared first quarter dividend for the companys common stock the common dividend of is payable on february to stockholders of record on february and with ill move on to reviewing our outlook on slide for the full year of compared to our full year results we expect end of period loans to increase by to we expect that the gaap net interest margin will range between and our outlook incorporates no change to the fed funds rate in with this outlook for loan growth and net interest margin and reflecting the decline in interest rates in the second half of as well as declining accretion income in we expect that net interest income in will range from flat to growth of yearoveryear we expect noninterest expense excluding the amortization of tax credit and investments and core deposit premiums to increase approximately we anticipate that the provision for credit losses will range between million and million finally we project that the effective tax rate will be approximately for as we expect to continue to invest in tax credit investments we expect to make approximately million of historic and clean energy tax credit investments in and project an amortization rate of approximately for the first quarter of we currently expect tax credit amortization will be approximately million with that i will now turn the call back to dominic for closing remarks dominic ng chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you irene i will now open up the call to questions operator east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question today comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning irene h oh a executive vice president and chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess just first question dominic you talked about just the impact from the china trade dispute on the wholesale trade portfolio and theres been enough conversation on whether how meaningful that impact has been on your ci growth would love to get your sort of thoughts on how you expect to play out for the ci lending both in terms of the specialty lending verticals where east west has been focused on and in terms of geographies and all the hiring that youve done are you going into new markets like whats going to be in your view driving growth on the ci side dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc at this point i think that we expect the growth comes from many different industry verticals and then the general ci and also of course including greater china and our crossborder business and we feel that in general there are different pockets of areas that would grow stronger than the others but the overall economic condition based on more clarity with this uschina dispute that result in the phase signing gives many of the business and our customers more comfort to start investing and growing the business and in addition to that when you look at the agreement they were signed which called for china buying billion more of goods from the united states from the baseline of and that is billion from and billion in in the various sectors including manufacturing energy and services et cetera and we feel that clearly there are opportunities for some of our clients who are exporting to china and east west is going to pay attention to those opportunities to make sure that we get our share of banking business so allinall i would say that particularly in the second half and is looking pretty promising ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just i guess on a separate topic you mentioned investments in the forex platform in hong kong and in the consumer digital platform here where should we see the benefits on the upsides of all those investments is it in higher fee revenue or in better deposit growth and just kind of should we expect these to be needle movers in terms of growth east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc both i mean like obviously for the fx new system it will be predominantly for fee income but keep in mind when we have a strong fx value proposition that can be a lead in for us to get a commercial banking business which will then result in loans and deposit too now but thats more indirect i think the direct part will be fee income from the digital banking side thats really predominantly focused on our consumer our core customer base and so for that i think well be a consumer core deposits interest bearing checking account noninterestbearing checking account so forth and we expect that there will be more core deposits coming and that will be in the next few years operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for the question im interested in credit quality i assume for a pretty notably sequentially there are some concerns i believe on residual effects of the energy stress in the third quarter could you provide maybe an update on what youre seeing in that portfolio maybe trending in classifieds and i believe there was a notable bankruptcy early in the quarter im wondering if thats kind of been addressed in the current reserve thanks irene h oh a executive vice president and chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yes chris so if we look at the energy portfolio just to answer your question specifically the problem loans that we identified earlier in the year and talked about in a little bit more detail on the last earnings call i think the good news is there really hasnt been a lot of new problem loans that have been identified the one loan that you are referring to was downgraded and in our view is appropriately reserved for in the fourth quarter in total if you look at the balances as of september end of kind of actually the other outstanding balances as of the end of september for criticized and classified assets was about million and as of the end of december that was million nonaccrual loans same kind of levels for september were million versus million as of the end of december hopefully that helps to clarify some of those questions you had chris operator our next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning irene h oh a executive vice president and chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning jared east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah looking at the growth expectations the loan growth expectations for of to does that assume that the wholesale trade business balances stay under pressure and if we saw more a phase or more confidence on the consumer or on the customer side could you see loan growth potentially be higher than that with the resumption of stronger wholesale trade lending dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well i think that we expect a positive turnaround hopefully sometime and but now we have to keep in mind is that its going to be a gradual process and if you looked at as i indicated in my remarks earlier in fact normally in the fourth quarter where we have a surge of the wholesale trade portfolio balances and but last quarter we actually ph did and its because everybodys holding out everyone knew that our president will be assigning a phase and so we all sort of stand in a sideline and then so why do something until we see what exactly is going to be signed on and now that once we get that clarity i think people is going to start focusing on what need to be done some got great benefit because exporter to china some also even as importer because of the the agreement of not putting tariff on those particular products or the agreement to drop from to that helps and then while others are basically stay the same at that tariff now the fact is even for those still have to pay tariff i mean in a way the good news is that now they know its not jumping to or or or is not having the very high uncertainty thats going on indiscernible from coming from our president and so forth so in that standpoint people had dealt with those tariff and manage it for the last two years and many of them have managed it pretty well in terms of whether its cutting costs a little bit here and there having the chinese government to provide tax credit tax subsidy or just pass right through to us consumers and us consumers also seem to be taking those pass through very nicely as weve seen in the retail report for the fourth quarter so far so allinall i see that there will be a little bit more normalization of trade activity going on in its going to take a few months to ramp up and so i would expect that in the first two quarters we shouldnt be expecting a whole lot of substantial growth but then well be more or less maybe like last year but then in the third quarter and fourth quarter it ought to be picking up thats what i see in the trade side but for the other portfolio i think well be more or less of people looking at the general us economy that i think clearly with the uncertainty of trade dispute by the way is not just with china but also with many of the other countries have caused concern for many us business and now when the business overall see what the overall interest rate climate plus some of these settlements of the trade tariffs and so forth i think in general the business sentiment is getting a little bit more comfortable so we hope that the other ci verticals that we have moved hopefully also be picking up a little bit so thats the assumption that we have and in terms of looking at outlook and beyond jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and just circling back on the on capital management i know this is something ive asked on other calls but capital continues to grow the tce ratio is still growing at a substantial level what else should we be thinking about in terms of capital management with the growth in the similar range as we saw in i guess why not come in and do a buyback and help manage capital at this point east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc i think in this i would reiterate what we share i think i guess in a more than two conference calls before that well first and foremost we are a management team that are shareholders friendly including our board by the way so we constantly at our board meetings evaluate and review this sort of opportunity cost of our capital shall we shall we not buy back and that im pretty sure in our next board meeting well have another very detailed discussion of this sort of alternative out there versus buyback one of the things that we do looked at though is that as we just shared in this earnings call we have well above industry average return of asset and return of equity our loan growth you know last year average loan growth is about and so were still doing pretty well and the other interesting part is that with this new dynamic that we are seeing right now that china has signed agreement in terms of better protect intellectual property and better protect companies who lets say are being pushed to transfer technology and china now have mechanism in place to penalize stateowned enterprises or any government entities to do that so when we see there is a better clarity in these laws that attract foreign investment when the vice minister just announced at how much china wanted to attract foreign direct investments and in fact foreign direct investments in china even in have grown by a few percent and all of those are indications that we at east west bank wanted to make sure while we are looking at the obvious good choice of potential capital buyback we also need to balance to see that it is unlikely therell be great opportunity what is in the us or in greater china that we would we wanted to fully invest to ensure we have an even stronger sustainable profitable performance for many years to come and i can only reflect back in the last years we have deliberately spent our capital into investing in people and infrastructure which allow us to build such a very diverse loan portfolio and deposit portfolio so that allow at any particular time and year that if some particular sector slowdown the other sectors picked up there are not many banks in the country that have a very evenly spread of ci cre and residential consumer portfolio that spray out very nicely in different categories and allow us to put lever at different time we would like to continue to further diversify our loan portfolio improve our fee income et cetera and so well continue to make those investments but at any point of time we feel that even with those investments and we still have excess capital that is redundant that obviously we will step in and start making a buyback so thats the plan operator our next question comes from brock vandervliet with ubs please go ahead brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thank you for the question the derivatives business was obviously a great quarter great couple of quarters here with the fed probably done should we be looking for this to kind of tail off or not irene h oh a executive vice president and chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah brock so if you look at from a customer revenue perspective the revenue from interest rate contracts and other derivatives was million net of the cva adjustment rounding there at million when we look at although were confident that we will be able to grow fee income line items from all other categories just given the nature of the rate curve the inversion earlier this year that really supported the volume increase we had in the third quarter in particular and second quarter we dont expect this level of customer revenue in for irc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got you got you okay and separately as you can imagine cecl is providing all sorts of fun with numbers for analysts irene h oh a executive vice president and chief financial officer east west bancorp inc but not for you brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc and as i look at your reserve at the trueup and what youre anticipating for provisions can you help us dimension what you may be looking at in terms of chargeoffs is a number of basis points is that reasonable to expect going forward or too high irene h oh a executive vice president and chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah so brock thats a great question and i want to just kind of caution no this is our view today for the day one reserve you know actually that may change as our models change or forecasts change and theres some finalization that were still doing particular on the qualitative factors but given the call we wanted to share what our views were today and that is that increase from the yearend in current model calculation on day two we have traditionally given the guidance on the provision for the full year as you probably have noted the range that were providing for the provision is wider and thats largely given our kind of views that compared to the incurred model likelihood is that therell be more volatility on the provision over the course of the year driven by kind of changes to the forecast so thats certainly that were factoring overall when we look at the credit environment we think itll be relatively the same and with those numbers were modeling in kind of gross chargeoffs at similar levels to if thats helpful for you operator our next question comes from michael young with suntrust please go ahead michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey good morning thanks for taking the question i wanted to ask about the sort of loantodeposit ratio i know dominic you mentioned that you wanted to continue to operate within the to range but given kind of where rates are and the stability here do you think that youd allow that maybe to drift higher as it may be easier to put on new deposits at lower rates now irene h oh a executive vice president and chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah i think first and foremost we always want to ensure that we have enough liquidity right and that we have enough core deposits to fund our loan growth that franchise value for a bank is that core deposit franchise so that range that we have the to is a range that were comfortable with at this point in time i do not think well inch that up much higher and to kind of more specifically address your question if we have the opportunity to east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 reduce kind of bring on additional deposits at a lower cost what well probably do with that is let some of the higher operating cost operating higher cost deposits run out michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and then as a followup i think at the beginning of last year you had mentioned a couple of demand deposits focused initiatives particularly on the consumer side i just wanted to get an update if any of those were moving ahead or if weve seen any benefits from those at this point dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc it went really well in and so with that momentum we will continue in so our consumer banking team specific the retail branches are all geared up to keep going out there and bringing in small business customers one at a time and then we opened many many accounts last year and i expect them to continue to use their center of influence to help them cta lawyers and so forth to help them to continue to open the small business account one at a time michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc yeah operator our next question comes from gary tenner with da davidson please go ahead gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co thanks good morning irene h oh a executive vice president and chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning gary gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co i want to ask a question or a question on loan growth outlook maybe a little different way if we look at the end of period yearoveryear loan growth was a little over and certainly pressured in the fourth quarter by not having wholesale trade benefit that you typically do so dominic given your comments about a better outlook for the back half of the year on wholesale trade as theres some more clarity for your customers why wouldnt that normalization maybe for help a better more positive rebound in overall loan growth is it expectation of a slowdown or slower pace of growth in the other loan segments dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well i think that overall what we projected right now is based on our current activity and we do expect that some of this sort of positive momentum is going to take a little bit of time to ramp up so therefore and right now we prudently projected to be to obviously well revise our guidance if we actually see even stronger momentum going forward east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript  earnings call 23jan2020 gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co okay the rest of my questions were asked and answered so thank you dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from david chiaverini with wedbush securities please go ahead david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks a couple of questions for you so the first one i wanted to follow up on energy are you planning to grow the energy book or do you or conversely do you plan to reduce or exit this portfolio given the credit issues dominic ng a chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc at this point i dont think there is any hot and its going to be a very low likelihood of any growth the reason is because obviously as everyone know in the industry that you know the equity investors are hard to find in these days so therefore in order for us to do good deals we need to have strong equity partners to have us to put on senior debt who quite frankly at this point right now i think the likelihood of whats growing is very to very low i think that there will be a higher likelihood we probably reduce the portfolio just naturally because of some pay down and so forth david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks for that and then shifting gears more of a housekeeping question that you mentioned about the guidance for tax credit amortization expense you said million for the first quarter and you gave the full year amount but do you happen to have any guidance for the second quarter third quarter and fourth quarter irene h oh a executive vice president and chief financial officer east west bancorp inc we do not at this point but you have full year number and that will help you david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc yep thank you operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to dominic ng for any closing remarks dominic ng chairman president chief executive officer east west bancorp inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript
