withdrawals and obligations to other counterparties as they come due or to obtain adequate funding at a reasonable cost to meet those obligations liquidity risk also considers the stability of deposits the objective of liquidity management is to manage the potential mismatch of asset and liability cash flows maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the institutions ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flow and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily operations or the financial condition of the institution to achieve this objective the company analyzes its liquidity risk maintains readily available liquid assets and utilizes diverse funding sources including its stable core deposit base the roc has primary oversight responsibility over liquidity risk management at the management level the companys assetliability committee alco establishes the liquidity guidelines that govern the daytoday active management of the companys liquidity position by requiring sufficient assetbased liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and avoid overdependence on volatile less reliable funding markets these guidelines are established and monitored for both the bank and east west on a standalone basis to ensure that the company can serve as a source of strength for its subsidiaries the alco regularly monitors the companys liquidity status and related management processes and provides regular reports on the companys liquidity position relative to policy limits and guidelines to the board of directors the liquidity management practices have been effective under normal operating and stressed market conditions the company also maintains a contingency funding plan that provides an earlywarning methodology

factors in the companys form 10k market risk management market risk refers to the risk of potential loss due to adverse movements in market risk factors including interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and credit spreads the company is primarily exposed to interest rate risk through its core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits there have been no significant changes in our risk management practices as described in item mda market risk management in the companys form 10k interest rate risk management interest rate risk is the risk that market fluctuations in interest rates can have a negative impact on the companys earnings and capital stemming from mismatches in the companys asset and liability cash flows primarily arising from customerrelated activities such as lending and deposittaking the company is subject to interest rate risk because assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times if assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising earnings will initially increase assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts short and longterm market interest rates may change by different amounts for example the shape of the yield curve may affect the yield of new loans and funding costs differently the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change for example if longterm mortgage interest rates increase sharply mortgagerelated products may pay down at a slower rate than anticipated which could impact portfolio income and valuation or interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand collateral values mortgage origination volume and the fair value of other financial instruments the alco coordinates the overall management of the companys interest rate risk meets regularly to review the companys open market positions and establishes policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk interest rate risk management is carried out primarily through strategies involving the companys loan portfolio debt securities portfolio available funding channels and capital market activities in addition the companys policies permit the use of derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk we measure and monitor interest rate risk exposure through various risk management tools which include a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analyses under multiple interest rate scenarios against a baseline the simulation model incorporates the markets forward rate expectations and the companys earning assets and liabilities the company uses both a static balance sheet and a forward growth balance sheet to perform the interest rate sensitivity analyses the simulated interest rate scenarios include an instantaneous nonparallel shift in the yield curve and a gradual nonparallel shift in the yield curve rate ramp in addition the company also performs simulations using other alternative interest rate scenarios including various permutations of the yield curve flattening steepening or inverting the company uses the results of these simulations to formulate and gauge strategies to achieve a desired risk profile within its capital and liquidity guidelines the net interest income simulation model is based on the maturity and repricing characteristics of the companys interest rate sensitive assets liabilities and related derivative contracts this model also incorporates various assumptions which management believes to be reasonable but that may have a significant impact on the results these key assumptions include the timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates the yield curve evolution and shape the correlation between various interest rate indices financial instruments future repricing characteristics and spread relative to benchmark rates and the effect of interest rate floors and caps the modeled results are highly sensitive to deposit decay and deposit beta assumptions which we derive from a regression analysis of the companys historical deposit data simulation results are highly dependent on modeled behaviors and input assumptions to the extent that actual behaviors are different from the assumptions used in the models there could be material changes to the interest rate sensitivity results the key behavioral models impacting interest rate sensitivity simulations include deposit repricing deposit balance forecasts and mortgage prepayments these models and assumptions are documented supported and periodically backtested to assess the reasonableness and effectiveness the company also regularly monitors the sensitivity of the other important modeling assumptions such as loan and security prepayments and early withdrawal on fixedrate customer liabilities the company makes appropriate calibrations to the model as needed and continually validates the model methodology and results changes to key model assumptions are reviewed by the alco scenario results do not reflect strategies that the management could employ to limit the impact of changing interest rate expectations the simulation does not represent a forecast of the companys net interest income but is a tool utilized to assess the risk of the impact of changing market interest rates across a range of interest rate environments the company employs a variety of quantitative and qualitative approaches to capture historical deposit repricing and balance behaviors these historical observations are performed at a granular level based on key product characteristics including distinctions for brokered public and large commercial deposits which are then combined with forwardlooking market expectations and the competitive landscape to generate the deposit repricing and balance forecasting models the company uses these deposit repricing models to forecast deposit interest expense the repricing models provide sufficient granularity to reflect key behavioral differences across product and customer types the deposit beta is a key parameter of the deposit rate forecast the deposit beta defines the sensitivity of deposit rates to changes in the effective fed funds rate in june the company assumed a weightedaverage beta of for total deposits an increase of approximately from december which was due to deposit product mix changes as product level deposit beta assumptions were not updated the company updated the deposit mix assumptions in march to assume that noninterestbearing deposits would migrate to interestbearing certificates of deposit cds the updated assumptions reduced the proportion of noninterestbearing deposits for the base case and decreasing interest rate scenarios and reduced the repricing speed of the cd portfolio to better reflect its maturity profile in june the repricing speed of the cd portfolio was updated to maintain the existing maturity profile due to deposit mix changes from interest rate shocks as loan and security prepayment assumptions are key components of the companys model the company incorporates thirdparty vendor models to forecast prepayment behavior on mortgage loans and securities which have mortgage loans as underlying collateral these thirdparty vendor models have access to more comprehensive industrylevel data which can capture specific borrower and collateral characteristics over a variety of interest rate cycles the company will periodically assess and adjust the vendor models when appropriate to include its own available observations and expectations in the company updated its version of the vendor prepayment model to better support the transition from london interbank offered rate to secured overnight financing rate sofr indexed loans and updated tuning factors to slow prepayment speeds on singlefamily residential mortgages to better align them with actual and expected prepayments twelvemonth net interest income simulation net interest income simulation modeling measures interest rate risk through earnings volatility the simulation projects the cash flow changes in interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities expressed in terms of net interest income over a specified time horizon for defined interest rate scenarios net interest income simulations provide insight into the impact of market rate changes on earnings which help guide risk management decisions the company assesses interest rate risk by comparing the changes of net interest income in different interest rate scenarios the following table presents the companys net interest income sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained nonparallel shift in market interest rates by and bps as of june and december on a balance sheet assuming flat forward rates and flat loan and deposit growth on the date of analysis the nonparallel shift scenarios were calibrated internally based on historical analysis net interest income volatility change in interest rates in bps june december the percentage change represents net interest income change over a 12month period in a stable interest rate environment versus in the various interest rate scenarios the composition of the companys loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to a mismatch of repricing behavior between the floatingrate loan portfolio and deposit products in the table above net interest income volatility expressed in relation to basecase net interest income d ecreased for rising rate scenarios an d increased for decreasing rate scenarios as of june this change reflects deposit product mix assumptions which assume noninterestbearing deposits decrease in higher interest rate environments and are replaced with term deposit products the company also models scenarios based on gradual shifts in interest rates and assesses the corresponding impacts these interest rate scenarios provide additional information to estimate the companys underlying interest rate risk the rate ramp table below shows the net interest income volatility under a gradual nonparallel shift of the yield curve in even monthly increments over the first months followed by rates held constant thereafter based on a flat balance sheet as of the date of the analysis net interest income volatility change in interest rates in bps june december rate ramp rate ramp rate ramp rate ramp as of june the companys net interest income profile reflects an asset sensitive position where assets reprice faster or more significantly than liabilities net interest income is expected to increase when interest rates rise as the company has a large population of variable rate loans primarily tied to prime and term sofr indices the companys interest income is sensitive to changes in shortterm interest rates as of june the company designated interest rate contracts with a notional amount of billion as cash flow hedges which reduced net interest income volatility by approximately of the base net interest income for every bps change in interest rate a majority of the companys deposit portfolio is composed of nonmaturity deposits which are not directly tied to shortterm interest rate indices but are nevertheless sensitive to changes in shortterm interest rates the modeled results are highly sensitive to modeled behavior and assumptions actual net interest income results may deviate from the models net interest income due to earning asset growth variation and deposit mix changes based on customer preferences relative to the interest rate environment during a period of declining interest rates balance sheet growth could offset headwinds to net interest income from yield compression economic value of equity at risk economic value of equity eve is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows this calculation is used for assetliability management and measures changes in the economic value of the banks assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates the economic value approach provides a comparatively broader scope than the net interest income volatility approach since it represents the discounted present value of cash flows over the expected life of the instruments due to this longer horizon eve is useful to identify risks arising from repricing prepayment and maturity gaps between assets and liabilities on the balance sheet as well as from offbalance sheet derivative exposures over their lifetime this longterm economic perspective into the companys interest rate risk profile allows the company to identify anticipated negative effects of interest rate fluctuations however the difference in time horizons can cause the eve analysis to diverge from the shorterterm net interest income analysis presented above given the uncertainty of the magnitude timing and direction of future interest rate movements the shape of the yield curve and potential changes to the balance sheet actual results may vary from those predicted by the companys model the following table presents the companys eve sensitivity related to an instantaneous nonparallel shift in market interest rates by and bps as of june and december the nonparallel shift scenarios were calibrated internally based on historical analysis eve volatility change in interest rates in bps june december the percentage change represents net portfolio value change of the company in a stable interest rate environment versus in the various interest rate scenarios as of june the companys eve is expected to decrease when interest rates rise the change in eve sensitivity was due to changes in the structure of the balance sheet as well as changes in the underlying valuations and durations of assets and liabilities derivatives it is the companys policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices however the company periodically enters into derivative transactions in order to manage its exposure to market risk primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the company believes these derivative transactions when properly structured and managed provide a hedge against inherent risk in certain assets and liabilities or against risk in specific transactions hedging transactions may be implemented using a variety of derivative instruments such as swaps forwards options and collars the company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in interest received on certain floatingrate commercial loans and interest paid on certain floatingrate borrowings foreign exchange derivatives are used in net investment hedging strategies to mitigate the risk of changes in the us dollar equivalent value of a designated monetary amount of the companys net investment in east west bank china limited prior to entering any hedge accounting activity the company analyzes the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to alternative strategies the company also repositions its hedging derivatives portfolio based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate and foreign currency environments balance sheet composition and trends and the relative mix of its cash and derivative positions in addition the company enters into derivative transactions in order to accommodate its customers with their business needs or to assist customers with their risk management objectives such as managing exposure to fluctuations in interest rates foreign currencies and commodity prices to economically hedge against the derivative contracts entered into with the companys customers the company enters into offsetting derivative contracts with thirdparty financial institutions some of which are cleared through central clearing organizations the exposures from derivative transactions are collateralized by cash andor eligible securities based on limits as set forth in the respective agreements between the company and counterparty financial institutions the fair value changes of the derivative contracts traded with thirdparty financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the fair value changes of the derivative transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts except for the credit valuation adjustment component in the contracts and the spread variances between the customer derivatives and the offsetting financial counterparty positions the company also utilizes foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the economic effect of fluctuations in certain foreign currency onbalance sheet assets and liabilities primarily foreign currency denominated deposits offered to its customers the company is subject to credit risk associated with the counterparties to the derivative contracts this counterparty credit risk is a multidimensional form of risk affected by both the exposure and credit quality of the counterparty both of which are sensitive to marketinduced changes the companys credit risk management committee provides oversight of credit risk and the company has guidelines in place to manage counterparty concentration tenor limits and collateral the company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements and by requiring collateral arrangements where possible the company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to thirdparty financial institutions through the use of credit risk participation agreements certain derivative contracts are required to be cleared through central clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk where variation margin is applied daily as settlement to the fair value of the derivative contracts in addition the company incorporates credit value adjustments and other market standard methodologies to appropriately reflect the counterpartys and the companys own nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement of its derivatives as of june the company anticipates performance by its counterparties and has not incurred any related credit losses
