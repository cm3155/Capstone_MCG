intended to quantify the potential impact of a liquidity event on the financial and liquidity position of the entity these scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources market triggers and potential uses of funding and economic conditions in certain countries in addition company specific events are incorporated into the stress testing liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons both immediate and longer term and over a variety of stressed conditions given the range of potential stresses the company maintains a series of contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities in response to recent developments relating to covid19 the company is closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on its business the uncertainty surrounding covid19 and in the financial service industry in general could potentially impact the liquidity of the company the strained economic capital credit andor financial market conditions may expose the company to liquidity risk as of march the company was not aware of any material commitments for

may change resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices including interest rates foreign exchange rates interest rate contracts investment securities prices and related risk resulting from mismatches in rate sensitive assets and liabilities the boards risk oversight committee has primary oversight responsibility at the management level the alco establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market risk management activities corporate treasury supports the alco in measuring monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks interest rate risk management interest rate risk results primarily from the companys traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans and is the primary market risk for the company economic and financial conditions movements in interest rates and consumer preferences impact the level of noninterestbearing funding sources at the company and affect the difference between the interest the company earns on interestearning assets and pays on interestbearing liabilities in addition changes in interest rates can influence the rate of principal prepayments on loans and the speed of deposit withdrawals due to the pricing term mismatches and the embedded options inherent in certain products changes in market interest rates not only affect expected nearterm earnings but also the economic value of these interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities other market risks include foreign currency exchange risk and equity price risk these risks are not considered significant to the company and no separate quantitative information concerning these risks is presented herein with oversight by the companys board of directors the alco coordinates the overall management of the companys interest rate risk the alco meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing the companys open market positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk management of interest rate risk is carried out primarily through strategies involving the companys investment securities portfolio loan portfolio available funding channels and capital market activities in addition the companys policies permit the use of derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk the interest rate risk exposure is measured and monitored through various risk management tools which include a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analyses under multiple interest rate scenarios the model incorporates the companys cash instruments loans debt securities resale agreements deposits borrowings and repurchase agreements as well as financial instruments from the companys foreign operations the company incorporates both a static balance sheet and a forward growth balance sheet in order to perform these analyses the simulated interest rate scenarios include a nonparallel shift in the yield curve rate shock and a gradual nonparallel shift in the yield curve rate ramp in addition the company also performs simulations using alternative interest rate scenarios including various permutations of the yield curve flattening steepening or inverting results of these various simulations are used to formulate and gauge strategies to achieve a desired risk profile within the companys capital and liquidity guidelines the net interest income simulation model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of the companys interestrate sensitive assets liabilities and related derivative contracts it also incorporates various assumptions which management believes to be reasonable but may have a significant impact on results these assumptions include but are not limited to the timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates the yield curve evolution and shape the correlation between various interest rate indices financial instrument future repricing characteristics and spread relative to benchmark rates and the effect of interest rate floors and caps the modeled results are highly sensitive to deposit decay and deposit beta assumptions derived from a regression analysis of the companys historical deposit data deposit beta commonly refers to the correlation of the change in interest rates paid on deposits to changes in benchmark market interest rates the model is also sensitive to the loan and investment prepayment assumptions based on an independent model and the companys historical prepayment data which consider anticipated prepayments under different interest rate environments simulation results are highly dependent on input assumptions to the extent actual behavior is different from the assumptions in the models there could be a material change in interest rate sensitivity the assumptions applied in the model are documented and supported for reasonableness and periodically backtested to assess their effectiveness the company makes appropriate calibrations to the model as needed continually refining the model methodology and results changes to key model assumptions are reviewed by the alco scenario results do not reflect strategies that management could employ to limit the impact of changing interest rate expectations twelvemonth net interest income simulation net interest income simulation modeling looks at interest rate risk through earnings it projects the changes in interest rate sensitive asset and liability cash flows expressed in terms of net interest income over a specified time horizon for defined interest rates scenarios net interest income simulations generate insight into the impact of market rates changes on earnings and guide risk management decisions the company assesses interest rate risk by comparing net interest income using different interest rate scenarios the following table presents the companys net interest income sensitivity as of march and december related to an instantaneous and sustained nonparallel shift in market interest rates of and basis points in both directions change in interest rates basis points net interest income volatility march december the percentage change represents net interest income over months in a stable interest rate environment versus net interest income in the various rate scenarios the companys estimated twelvemonth net interest income sensitivity as of march was lower when compared with the sensitivity as of december for both the upward and upward basis point rate scenarios this reflects a greater rate of upward repricing in the companys deposit portfolio which offsets simulated increases in interest income from higher interest rates on assets the reduction in simulated increases in interest income is also impacted by the increase in the population of floating rate loans that are currently at their floors which has increased under the current low interest rate environment in both of the simulated downward interest rate scenarios sensitivity is primarily decreased as a result of the basis point reduction in the federal funds target rate range to and during march the companys net interest income profile as of march reflects an asset sensitive position net interest income would be expected to increase if interest rates rise and to decrease if interest rates decline albeit the federal funds rate is floored at the target range between and the company is naturally asset sensitive due to the large share of variable rate loans in its loan portfolio which are primarily linked to prime and libor indices the companys interest income is vulnerable to changes in shortterm interest rates the companys deposit portfolio is primarily comprised of nonmaturity deposits which are not directly tied to shortterm interest rate indices but are nevertheless sensitive to changes in shortterm interest rates the federal funds target rate was between and as of march and between and as of december in its statement released on march the federal open market committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to a range of between to and on march further announced its decision to lower the target range to and the fed deemed that the effects of the covid19 pandemic will weigh on economic activity in the near term and pose risks to the economic outlook while an instantaneous and sustained nonparallel shift in market interest rates was used in the simulation model described in the preceding paragraphs the company believes that any shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact the rate ramp table below shows the net income volatility under a gradual nonparallel shift upward and downward of the yield curve in even quarterly increments over the first twelve months followed by rates held constant thereafter change in interest rates basis points net interest income volatility march december rate ramp rate ramp rate ramp rate ramp the percentage change represents net interest income under a gradual nonparallel shift in even quarterly increments over months the company believes that the rate ramp table shown above when evaluated together with the results of the rate shock simulation presents a better indication of the potential impact to the companys twelvemonth net interest income in a rising and falling rate scenario between march and december the companys modeled sensitivity slightly decreased under a ramp simulation economic value of equity at risk economic value of equity eve is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows this calculation is used for assetliability management and measures changes in the economic value of the bank the fair market values of a banks assets and liabilities are directly linked to interest rates in some ways the economic value approach provides a broader scope than the net income volatility approach since it captures all anticipated cash flows eve simulation reflects the effect of interest rate shifts on the value of the company and is used to assess the degree of interest rate risk exposure in contrast to the earnings perspective the economic perspective identifies risk arising from repricing or maturity gaps for the life of the balance sheet changes in economic value indicate anticipated changes in the value of the banks future cash flows thus the economic perspective can provide a leading indicator of the banks future earnings and capital values the economic valuation method also reflects those sensitivities across the full maturity spectrum of the banks assets and liabilities the following table presents the companys eve sensitivity as of march and december related to an instantaneous and sustained nonparallel shift in market interest rates of and basis points in both directions change in interest rates basis points eve volatility march december the percentage change represents net portfolio value of the company in a stable interest rate environment versus net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios the companys eve sensitivity for the upward interest rate scenarios increased as of march the sensitivity for the downward basis points scenario decreased while the sensitivity for the downward basis points scenario increased as of march as compared with the results as of december the changes in eve sensitivity during this period were primarily due to the reduced base eve and the change in level and shape of the yield curve the companys eve profile as of march reflects an asset sensitive eve position given the uncertainty of the magnitude timing and direction of future interest rate movements and the shape of the yield curve actual results may vary from those predicted by the companys model derivatives it is the companys policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices however the company will from time to time enter into derivative transactions in order to reduce its exposure to market risks primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the company believes that these derivative transactions when properly structured and managed may provide a hedge against inherent risk in certain assets and liabilities and against risk in specific transactions hedging transactions may be implemented using a variety of derivative instruments such as swaps forwards and options prior to entering into any hedging activities the company analyzes the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to alternative strategies in addition the company enters into derivative transactions in order to assist customers with their risk management objectives primarily to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates foreign currencies and commodity prices to economically hedge against the derivative contracts entered into with the companys customers the company enters into mirrored derivative contracts with thirdparty financial institutions the exposures from derivative transactions are collateralized by cash andor eligible securities based on limits as set forth in the respective agreements entered between the company and the financial institutions the company is subject to credit risk associated with the counterparties to the derivative contracts this counterparty credit risk is a multidimensional form of risk affected by both the exposure and credit quality of the counterparty both of which are sensitive to marketinduced changes the companys credit risk management committee provides oversight of credit risks and the company has guidelines in place to manage counterparty concentration tenor limits and collateral the company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties entering into legally enforceable master netting arrangements and requiring collateral arrangements where possible the company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to institutional third parties through the use of credit risk participation agreements rpas certain derivative contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk the company incorporates credit value adjustments and other market standard methodologies to appropriately reflect its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of its derivatives fair value hedges as of march the company had two cancellable interest rate swap contracts with original terms of years these swap contracts involve the exchange of variable rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts the changes in fair value of the hedged brokered certificates of deposit are expected to be effectively offset by the changes in fair value of the swaps throughout the terms of these contracts net investment hedges asc foreign currency matters foreign currency transactions and asc derivatives and hedging allow hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation the company entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its investment in east west bank china limited a nonus dollar usd functional currency subsidiary in china the hedging instruments designated as net investment hedges involve hedging the risk of changes in the usd equivalent value of a designated monetary amount of the companys net investment in east west bank china limited against the risk of adverse changes in the foreign currency exchange rate of the chinese renminbi rmb as of march the outstanding foreign currency forwards effectively hedged approximately of the rmb exposure in east west bank china limited the fluctuation in foreign currency translation of the hedged exposure is expected to be offset by changes in the fair value of the forwards interest rate contracts the company offers various interest rate derivative contracts to its customers when derivative transactions are executed with its customers the derivative contracts are offset by paired trades with thirdparty financial institutions including with central clearing organizations certain derivative contracts entered with central clearing organizations are settledtomarket daily to the extent the central clearing organizations rulebooks legally characterize the variation margin as settlement derivative contracts allow borrowers to lock in attractive intermediate and longterm fixed rate financing while not increasing the interest rate risk to the company these transactions are not linked to specific company assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet or to forecasted transactions in a hedging relationship and therefore are economic hedges the contracts are markedtomarket at each reporting period the changes in fair values of the derivative contracts traded with thirdparty financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the derivative transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts except for the credit valuation adjustment component the company records credit valuation adjustments on derivatives to properly reflect the variances of credit worthiness between the company and the counterparties considering the effects of enforceable master netting agreements and collateral arrangements foreign exchange contracts the company enters into foreign exchange contracts with its customers consisting of forward spot swap and option contracts to accommodate the business needs of its customers for the foreign exchange contracts entered into with its customers the company managed its foreign exchange exposure by entering into offsetting foreign exchange contracts with thirdparty financial institutions andor entering into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements with customer counterparties to manage its credit exposure the changes in the fair values entered with thirdparty financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the foreign exchange transactions executed with the customers throughout the terms of these contracts the company also utilizes foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the economic effect of fluctuations in certain foreign currency onbalance sheet assets and liabilities primarily foreign currency denominated deposits offered to its customers the companys policies permit taking proprietary currency positions within approved limits in compliance with the proprietary trading exemption provided under section of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act the company does not speculate in the foreign exchange markets and actively manages its foreign exchange exposures within prescribed risk limits and defined controls credit contracts the company may periodically enter into rpas to manage the credit exposure on interest rate contracts associated with its syndicated loans the company may enter into protection sold or protection purchased rpas with institutional counterparties under the rpa the company will receive or make a payment if a borrower defaults on the related interest rate contract the company manages its credit risk on the rpas by monitoring the credit worthiness of the borrowers which is based on the companys normal credit review process equity contracts as part of the loan origination process from time to time the company obtained warrants to purchase preferred andor common stock of technology and life sciences companies it provides loans to the warrants included on the consolidated financial statements were from public and private companies commodity contracts the company entered into energy commodity contracts with its customers to allow them to hedge against the risk of fluctuation in energy commodity prices to economically hedge against the risk of fluctuation in commodity prices in the products offered to its customers the company enters into offsetting commodity contracts with thirdparty financial institutions including with central clearing organizations certain derivative contracts entered with central clearing organizations are settled to market daily to the extent the central clearing organizations rulebooks legally characterize the variation margin as settlement the changes in fair values of the energy commodity contracts traded with thirdparty financial institutions are expected to be largely

have been prepared according to gaap which require the measurement of financial and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs and the effect that general inflation may have on both shortterm and longterm interest rates since almost all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institutions performance than do general levels of inflation although inflation expectations do affect interest rates interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent
