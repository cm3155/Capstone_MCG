potential regulatory reforms in response to recent bank failures following the bank failures of march congress and federal regulatory agencies are considering potential changes to the laws and regulations that apply to banks on april the federal reserve and the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic issued reports on the failures of silicon valley bank and signature bank respectively identifying potential causes that the federal banking agencies may seek to address through changes to their supervisory and regulatory policies on july the federal reserve fdic and office of the comptroller of the currency jointly issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would revise the capital framework applicable to banking organizations with billion or more in total consolidated assets or with significant trading activity and if finalized would likely result in meaningfully increased capital requirements for those organizations by imposing additional costs on banking organizations with billion or more in total consolidated assets the proposal could reduce the benefits of growth beyond that size for a banking organization that has less than billion in total consolidated assets the extent of any further actions to be taken by these agencies or congress in response to the bank failures and potential causes highlighted in the federal reserve and fdic reports and the impact of any such actions on institutions with less than billion in total consolidated assets such as the company remains unclear fdic special assessment and uninsured deposits on may

receiverships of failed institutions the proposed rule would impose the special assessment for eight quarterly assessment periods beginning with the first quarter of assessment period subject to adjustments if the total amount collected is insufficient to cover the difs costs each quarterly special assessment would be equal to basis points of a banks estimated uninsured deposits that exceeded

liquidity risk management liquidity liquidity risk arises from the companys inability to meet its customer deposit withdrawals and obligations to other counterparties as they come due or to obtain adequate funding at a reasonable cost to meet those obligations liquidity risk also considers the stability of deposits the objective of liquidity management is to manage the potential mismatch of asset and liability cash flows maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the institutions ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flow and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily operations or the financial condition of the institution to achieve this objective the company analyzes its liquidity risk maintains readily available liquid assets and utilizes diverse funding sources including its stable core deposit base the board of directors risk oversight committee has primary oversight responsibility over liquidity risk management at the management level the companys assetliability committee alco establishes the liquidity guidelines that govern the daytoday active management of the companys liquidity position by requiring sufficient

actions liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons both immediate and longer term and over a variety of stressed conditions given the range of potential stresses the company maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities as of june the company believes it has adequate liquidity resources to conduct operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of business and is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect

financial position for more details on how economic conditions may impact our liquidity see item risk factors in the companys form 10k market risk management market risk refers to the risk of potential loss due to adverse movements in market risk factors including interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and credit spreads the company is primarily exposed to interest rate risk through its core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits there have been no significant changes in our risk management practices as described in item mda market risk management in the companys form 10k interest rate risk management interest rate risk is the risk that market fluctuations in interest rates can have a negative impact on the companys earnings and capital stemming from mismatches in the companys asset and liability cash flows primarily arising from customerrelated activities such as lending and deposittaking the company is subject to interest rate risk because assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times if assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising earnings will initially increase assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts short and longterm market interest rates may change by different amounts for example the shape of the yield curve may affect the yield of new loans and funding costs differently the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change for example if longterm mortgage interest rates increase sharply mortgagerelated products may pay down at a slower rate than anticipated which could impact portfolio income and valuation or interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand collateral values mortgage origination volume and the fair value of other financial instruments the alco coordinates the overall management of the companys interest rate risk meets regularly to review the companys open market positions and establishes policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk interest rate risk management is carried out primarily through strategies involving the companys loan portfolio debt securities portfolio available funding channels and capital market activities in addition the companys policies permit the use of derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk interest rate risk exposure is measured and monitored through various risk management tools which include a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analyses under multiple interest rate scenarios against a baseline the simulation model incorporates the markets forward rate expectations and the companys earning assets and liabilities the net interest income simulation model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of the companys interest rate sensitive assets liabilities and related derivative contracts it also incorporates various assumptions which management believes to be reasonable but may have a significant impact on the results simulation results are highly dependent on input assumptions to the extent the actual behavior is different from the assumptions used in the models there could be material changes in interest rate sensitivity results the assumptions applied in the model are documented supported and periodically backtested to assess the reasonableness and effectiveness for a more detailed discussion of the companys interest income simulation model refer to item mda market risk management in the companys form 10k the federal reserve continued its aggressive response to inflation by incrementally raising the target range for the fed funds rate during the first half of on july the federal reserve raised the target rate range to to twelvemonth net interest income simulation net interest income simulation modeling measures interest rate risk through earnings volatility the simulation projects the cash flow changes in interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities expressed in terms of net interest income over a specified time horizon for defined interest rate scenarios net interest income simulations provide insight into the impact of market rate changes on earnings which help guide risk management decisions the company assesses interest rate risk by comparing the changes of net interest income in different interest rate scenarios the following table presents the companys net interest income sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained nonparallel shift in market interest rates by and bps as of june and december based on a static balance sheet as of the date of the analysis net interest income volatility change in interest rates in bps june december the percentage change represents net interest income change over a 12month period in a stable interest rate environment versus in the various interest rate scenarios the composition of the companys loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to a mismatch of repricing behavior between the floatingrate loan portfolio and deposit products in the table above net interest income volatility expressed in relation to basecase net interest income decreased as of june this decrease reflected updates to the deposit repricing assumptions and deposit product mix noninterestbearing deposit account balances are assumed to be sensitive to interest rate levels and migrate to interestbearing deposit accounts the company also models scenarios based on gradual shifts in interest rates and assesses the corresponding impacts these interest rate scenarios provide additional information to estimate the companys underlying interest rate risk the rate ramp table below shows the net interest income volatility under a gradual nonparallel shift of the yield curve in even monthly increments over the first months followed by rates held constant thereafter based on a flat balance sheet as of the date of the analysis net interest income volatility change in interest rates in bps june december rate ramp rate ramp rate ramp rate ramp as of june the companys net interest income profile reflects an asset sensitive position where assets reprice more than liabilities net interest income is expected to increase when interest rates rise as the company has a large population of variable rate loans primarily tied to prime and term sofr indices the companys interest income is sensitive to changes in shortterm interest rates as of june the company designated interest rate contracts with a notional amount of billion as cash flow hedges which reduced net interest income volatility by approximately of the base net interest income for every bps change in interest rate the companys deposit portfolio is primarily composed of nonmaturity deposits which are not directly tied to shortterm interest rate indices but are nevertheless sensitive to changes in shortterm interest rates the modeled results are highly sensitive to deposit durations beta deposit mix and other behavioral assumptions which were derived using a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches actual results may deviate from the model results in terms of net interest income due to earning asset growth variation and deposit mix changes based on customer preferences relative to the interest rate environment during a period of declining interest rates balance sheet growth could offset headwinds to net interest income from yield compression economic value of equity at risk economic value of equity eve is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows this calculation is used for assetliability management and measures changes in the economic value of the bank the economic value approach provides a comparatively broader scope than the net interest income volatility approach since it represents the discounted present value of cash flows over the expected life of the instruments due to this longer horizon eve is useful to identify risks arising from repricing prepayment and maturity gaps between assets and liabilities on the balance sheet as well as from offbalance sheet derivative exposure over their lifetime this longterm economic perspective into the companys interest rate risk profile allows the company to identify anticipated negative effects of interest rate fluctuations however the difference in time horizons can cause the eve analysis to diverge from the shorter term net interest income analysis presented above given the uncertainty of the magnitude timing and direction of future interest rate movements the shape of the yield curve and potential changes to the balance sheet actual results may vary from those predicted by the companys model the following table presents the companys eve sensitivity related to an instantaneous nonparallel shift in market interest rates by and bps as of june and december eve volatility change in interest rates in bps june december the percentage change represents net portfolio value change of the company in a stable interest rate environment versus in the various interest rate scenarios as of june the companys eve is expected to decrease when interest rates rise the change in eve sensitivity was primarily due to updated deposit modeling assumptions which decreased the duration of the nonmaturity deposit portfolio derivatives it is the companys policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices however the company periodically enters into derivative transactions in order to manage its exposure to market risk primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the company believes these derivative transactions when properly structured and managed provide a hedge against inherent risk in certain
