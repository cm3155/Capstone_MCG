depends on the institutions ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flows and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily operations or the financial condition of the institution to achieve this objective the company analyzes its liquidity risk maintains readily available liquid assets and utilizes diverse funding sources including its stable core deposit base the board of directors risk oversight committee has primary oversight responsibility over liquidity risk management at the management level the companys assetliability committee alco establishes the liquidity guidelines that govern the daytoday active management of the companys liquidity position by requiring sufficient assetbased liquidity to cover potential funding requirements and avoid overdependence on volatile less reliable funding markets these guidelines are established and monitored for both the bank and east west on a standalone basis to ensure that the company can serve as a source of strength for its subsidiaries the alco regularly monitors the companys liquidity status and related management processes providing regular reports to the board of directors the companys liquidity management practices have been effective under normal operating and stressed market conditions liquidity risk liquidity sources the companys primary source of funding is from deposits generated by its banking business which are relatively stable and lowcost total deposits amounted to billion as of september compared with billion as of december the companys loantodeposit ratio was as of september compared with as of december in addition to deposits the company has access to various sources of wholesale financing including borrowing capacity with the fhlb and federal reserve bank of san francisco frbsf unsecured federal funds lines of credit with various correspondent banks and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio meet daily cash demands and allow management flexibility to execute its business strategy economic conditions and the stability of capital markets impact the companys access to and the cost of wholesale financing the companys access to capital markets is also affected by the ratings received from various credit rating agencies as of september the company had available borrowing capacity of billion the available borrowing capacity included billion with the fhlb billion with the frbsf unsecured federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks of million and borrowing capacity from unpledged debt securities of billion unencumbered loans andor debt securities were pledged to the fhlb and the frbsf discount window as collateral the company has established operational procedures to enable borrowing against these assets including regular monitoring of the total pool of loans and debt securities eligible as collateral eligibility of collateral is defined in guidelines from the fhlb and frbsf and is subject to change at their discretion the company believes that its liquidity sources are sufficient to meet all reasonably foreseeable shortterm needs see item mda balance sheet analysis deposits and other sources of funding in this form 10q for further detail related to the companys funding sources the company maintains a certain level of liquid assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents interestbearing deposits with banks shortterm resale agreements and unencumbered highquality and liquid afs debt securities the following table presents the

total unencumbered liquid assets totaled billion as of september compared with billion as of december afs debt securities included as part of liquidity sources consist of high quality and liquid securities with moderate durations to minimize overall interest rate and liquidity risks the company believes these afs debt securities provide quick sources of liquidity to obtain financing regardless of market conditions through sale or pledging the decrease in liquid assets was primarily related to the transfer of billion of debt securities from afs to htm during the first quarter of a decrease in cash and cash equivalents driven by loan funding activities a decrease in resale agreements primarily due to repayments and a decrease in fair value of afs debt securities primarily due to interest rate increases management believes that the companys excess cash unencumbered afs debt securities borrowing capacity and access to sufficient sources of capital are adequate to meet its short and longterm liquidity needs in the foreseeable future in addition the company may use debt and equity issuances when costs are deemed attractive should longer term needs arise liquidity risk cash requirements in the ordinary course of the companys business the company enters into contractual obligations that require future cash payments including funding for customer deposit withdrawals repayments for short and longterm borrowings leases obligations and other cash commitments the company also has offbalance sheet arrangements which represent transactions that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet the companys offbalance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments commercial letters of credit for foreign and domestic trade standby letters of credit sblcs and financial guarantees to meet the financing needs of its customers future interest obligations related to customer deposits and the companys borrowings and transactions with unconsolidated entities that provide financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to the company or engage in leasing hedging or research and development services with the company since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future funding requirements information about the companys loan commitments commercial letters of credit and sblcs is provided in note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10q the companys liquidity sources have been and are expected to be sufficient to meet all such cash requirements the consolidated statement of cash flows summarizes the companys sources and uses of cash by type of activities for the first nine

level liquidity management the company manages liquidity at the parent company level for various operating needs including payment of dividends repurchases of common stock principal and interest payments on its borrowings acquisitions and additional investments in its subsidiaries east wests primary source of liquidity is from cash dividends distributed by its subsidiary east west bank the bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends as discussed in item business supervision and regulation dividends and other transfers of funds of the companys form 10k east west held million and million in cash and cash equivalents as of september and december respectively management believes that east west has sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet the projected cash obligations for the current year liquidity risk liquidity stress testing the company utilizes liquidity stress analysis to determine the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the company foreign subsidiary and foreign branch levels needed to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios scenario analyses include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources market triggers potential uses of funding and economic conditions in certain countries in addition company specific events are incorporated into the stress testing liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons both immediate and longer term and over a variety of stressed conditions given the range of potential stresses the company maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities as of september the company was not aware of any material commitments for capital expenditures in the foreseeable future and believes it has adequate liquidity resources to conduct operations and meet other needs in the ordinary course of business given the uncertainty and the rapidly changing market and economic conditions the company will continue to actively evaluate the impact on its business and financial position for more information on how economic conditions may impact our liquidity see item risk factors of the companys form 10k market risk management market risk is the risk that the companys financial condition may change resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices including interest rates foreign exchange rates interest rate contracts prices investment securities prices credit spreads and related risk due to mismatches in rate sensitive assets and liabilities in the event of market stress the risk could have a material impact on the companys results of operations and financial condition the boards risk oversight committee has primary oversight responsibility over market risk management at the management level the alco establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market risk management activities corporate treasury supports the alco in measuring monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks interest rate risk management interest rate risk results primarily from the companys traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans which are the primary areas of market risk for the company economic and financial conditions movements in interest rates and consumer preferences impact the level of noninterestbearing funding sources at the company as well as affect the difference between the interest the company earns on interestearning assets and pays on interestbearing liabilities in addition changes in interest rates can influence the rate of principal prepayments on loans and the speed of deposit withdrawals due to the pricing term mismatches and the embedded options inherent in certain products changes in market interest rates affect not only the expected nearterm earnings but also the economic value of these interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities other market risks include foreign currency exchange risk and equity price risk these risks are not considered significant to the company and no separate quantitative information concerning these risks is presented herein under the oversight of the companys board of directors the alco coordinates the overall management of the companys interest rate risk the alco meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing the companys open market positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposures to market risk management of interest rate risk is carried out primarily through strategies involving the companys debt securities portfolio loan portfolio available funding channels and capital market activities in addition the companys policies permit the use of derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk the interest rate risk exposure is measured and monitored through various risk management tools which include a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analyses under various interest rate scenarios the model incorporates the companys cash instruments loans debt securities resale agreements deposits borrowings and repurchase agreements as well as financial instruments from the companys foreign operations the company uses both a static balance sheet and a forward growth balance sheet to perform the interest rate sensitivity analyses the simulated interest rate scenarios include an instantaneous nonparallel shift in the yield curve and a gradual nonparallel shift in the yield curve rate ramp over a static balance sheet in addition the company also performs simulations using other alternative interest rate scenarios including various permutations of the yield curve flattening steepening or inverting results of these various simulations are used to formulate and gauge strategies to achieve a desired risk profile within the companys capital and liquidity guidelines the net interest income simulation model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of the companys interestrate sensitive assets liabilities and related derivative contracts it also incorporates various assumptions which management believes to be reasonable but may have a significant impact on the results these assumptions include but are not limited to the timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates the yield curve evolution and shape the correlation between various interest rate indices financial instruments future repricing characteristics and spread relative to benchmark rates and the effect of interest rate floors and caps the modeled results are highly sensitive to deposit decay and deposit beta assumptions which are derived from a regression analysis of the companys historical deposit data the company used full throughtheeconomiccycle betas with each incremental rate increase in the rate ramp scenarios and did not assume lags in repricing deposit beta commonly refers to the correlation of the changes in interest rates paid on deposits to changes in the benchmark interest rates the model is also sensitive to the loan and investment prepayment assumptions that are based on an independent model and the companys historical prepayment data which consider anticipated prepayments under different interest rate environments simulation results are highly dependent on input assumptions to the extent the actual behavior is different from the assumptions used in the models there could be material changes in interest rate sensitivity results the assumptions applied in the model are documented supported and periodically backtested to assess the reasonableness and effectiveness the company makes appropriate calibrations to the model as needed and continually validates the model methodology and results changes to key model assumptions are reviewed by the alco scenario results do not reflect strategies that the management could employ to limit the impact of changing interest rate expectations in march the federal reserve raised the target range for the fed funds rate to to to address concerns about inflation which reflected supply and demand imbalances due to the pandemic higher energy prices and broader price pressures the federal reserve has continued its aggressive approach in responding to inflation and raised the target range for the fed funds rate to to on november the market estimates that interest rates are likely to continue to rise potentially reaching to by the end of twelvemonth net interest income simulation net interest income simulation modeling measures interest rate risk through earnings volatility the simulation projects the cash flow changes in interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities expressed in terms of net interest income over a specified time horizon for defined interest rate scenarios net interest income simulations provide insight into the impact of market rates changes on earnings which help guide risk management decisions the company assesses interest rate risk by comparing the changes of net interest income in different interest rate scenarios the following table presents the companys net interest income sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained nonparallel shift in market interest rates by and bps as of september and december based on a static balance sheet as of the date of the analysis change in interest rates in bps net interest income volatility september december nm nm nm not meaningful the percentage change represents net interest income change over month period in a stable interest rate environment versus in the various interest rate scenarios the composition of the companys loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the faster repricing of the floatingrate loan portfolio than the deposit products growth andor contraction in the companys loans other earning assets deposits and borrowings may lead to changes in the sensitivity to interest rate movements yeartodate decreases in cash and cash equivalents resale agreements and shortterm investments together with growth in fixedrate loans as well as the interest rate hedging activities and changes in the funding mix have decreased the companys asset sensitivity in the table above net interest income volatility is expressed in relation to the basecase net interest income which increased between september and december due to balance sheet growth and an expanded basecase net interest margin while an instantaneous and sustained nonparallel shift in market interest rates was used in the simulation model described in the preceding paragraph the company also models scenarios based on gradual shifts in interest rates and assesses the corresponding impacts these interest rate scenarios provide additional information to estimate the companys underlying interest rate risk the rate ramp table below shows the net interest income volatility under a gradual nonparallel shift of the yield curve in even monthly increments over the first months followed by rates held constant thereafter based on a static balance sheet as of the date of the analysis actual results will vary based on the timing and pace of interest rate changes as well as changes in the balance sheet change in interest rates in bps net interest income volatility september december rate ramp rate ramp rate ramp nm rate ramp nm nm not meaningful as of september the companys net interest income profile reflects an asset sensitive position net interest income is expected to increase when interest rates rise as the company has a large share of variable rate loans in its loan portfolio primarily linked to prime or libor indices the companys interest income is sensitive to changes in shortterm interest rates the companys deposit portfolio is primarily composed of nonmaturity deposits which are not directly tied to shortterm interest rate indices but are nevertheless sensitive to changes in shortterm interest rates the modeled results are highly sensitive to reinvestment yield and deposit beta assumptions actual results in terms of net interest income growth during a period of rising interest rates will also reflect earning asset growth and deposit mix changes based on customer preferences relative to the interest rate environment economic value of equity at risk economic value of equity eve is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows this calculation is used for assetliability management and measures changes in the economic value of the bank the economic value approach provides a comparatively broader scope than the net interest income volatility approach since it captures all anticipated cash flows the eve simulation reflects the sensitivity of the eve to interest rate changes across the full maturity spectrum of the companys assets and liabilities it identifies risks arising from repricing prepayment and maturity gaps between assets and liabilities on the balance sheet as well as from derivative exposures that are offbalance sheet the simulation provides longterm economic perspective into the banks interest rate risk profile which allows the bank to manage anticipated negative effects of interest rate fluctuations the following table presents the companys eve sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained nonparallel shift in market interest rates by and bps as of september and december change in interest rates in bps eve volatility september december nm nm nm not meaningful the percentage change represents net portfolio value change of the company in a stable interest rate environment versus in the various interest rate scenarios the companys eve sensitivity for the upward interest rate scenarios decreased as of september compared with the results as of december the changes in eve sensitivity were primarily due to faster deposit decay and higher deposit beta assumptions used in the model changes in the level and shape of the yield curve and lower cash balances as of september the companys eve profile as of september reflects an asset sensitive eve position under the higher interest rate scenarios given the uncertainty of the magnitude timing and direction of future interest rate movements as well as the shape of the yield curve actual results may vary from those predicted by the companys model derivatives it is the companys policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and energy commodity prices however the company periodically enters into derivative transactions in order to reduce its exposure to market risks primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the company believes that these derivative transactions when properly structured and managed provides a hedge against inherent risk in certain assets and liabilities or against risk in specific transactions hedging transactions may be implemented using a variety of derivative instruments such as swaps forwards options and collars prior to entering into any hedging activities the company analyzes the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to alternative strategies in addition the company enters into derivative transactions in order to assist customers with their risk management objectives such as managing exposure to fluctuations in interest rates foreign currencies and energy commodity prices to economically hedge against the derivative contracts entered with the companys customers the company enters into mirrored derivative contracts with thirdparty financial institutions the exposures from derivative transactions are collateralized by cash andor eligible securities based on limits as set forth in the respective agreements entered between the company and counterparty financial institutions the company is subject to credit risk associated with the counterparties to the derivative contracts this counterparty credit risk is a multidimensional form of risk affected by both the exposure and credit quality of the counterparty both of which are sensitive to marketinduced changes the companys credit risk management committee provides oversight of credit risks and the company has guidelines in place to manage counterparty concentration tenor limits and collateral the company manages the credit risk of its derivative exposures by diversifying its positions among various counterparties by entering into legally enforceable master netting arrangements and by requiring collateral arrangements where possible the company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to thirdparty financial institutions through the use of credit risk participation agreements certain derivative contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses which further mitigates credit risk the company incorporates credit value adjustments and other market standard methodologies to appropriately reflect its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of its derivatives the following table summarizes certain information about derivative financial
