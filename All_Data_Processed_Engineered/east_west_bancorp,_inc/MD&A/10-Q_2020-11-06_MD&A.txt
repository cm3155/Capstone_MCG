financial instruments credit losses that requires the measurement of the allowance for credit losses to be based on managements best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the

conditions reasonable and supportable forecasts and other relevant factors on january the adoption of the new accounting standard increased the allowance for loan losses by million and the allowance for unfunded credit commitments by million partially offset by an aftertax decrease to opening retained earnings of million the companys methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a collective basis for loan groups with similar risk characteristics and a specific allowance for loans which are individually evaluated for collectively evaluated loans the company uses quantitative models to forecast expected credit losses and these models consider historical credit loss experience current market and economic conditions and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable the company also considers qualitative factors in determining the allowance for loan losses qualitative adjustments are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses and which are not otherwise fully captured within the companys expected credit loss models in addition to the allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for unfunded credit commitments the company has three general areas where it provides the allowance for unfunded credit commitments recourse obligations for loans sold letters of credit and unfunded lending commitments the companys methodology for determining the allowance for unfunded lending commitments calculation uses the lifetime loss rates of the onbalance sheet commitment recourse obligations for loans sold and letters of credit use the weighted loss rates for the segment of the individual credit the company employs a disciplined process and methodology to establish its allowance for loan losses each quarter the process for estimating the allowance for loan losses takes into consideration many factors including historical and forecasted loan loss trends loanlevel credit quality ratings and loanspecific risk characteristics in addition to regular quarterly reviews of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses the company performs ongoing assessments of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is complex and requires judgement by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the company is committed to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level that is commensurate with the estimated inherent losses in the loan portfolio including unfunded credit facilities while the company believes that the allowance for loan losses was appropriate as of september

shock and a gradual nonparallel shift in the yield curve rate ramp in addition the company also performs simulations using alternative interest rate scenarios including various permutations of the yield curve flattening steepening or inverting results of these various simulations are used to formulate and gauge strategies to achieve a desired risk profile within the companys capital and liquidity guidelines the net interest income simulation model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of the companys interestrate sensitive assets liabilities and related derivative contracts it also incorporates various assumptions which management believes to be reasonable but may have a significant impact on results these assumptions include but are not limited to the timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates the yield curve evolution and shape the correlation between various interest rate indices financial instrument future repricing characteristics and spread relative to benchmark rates and the effect of interest rate floors and caps the modeled results are highly sensitive to deposit decay and deposit beta assumptions derived from a regression analysis of the companys historical deposit data deposit beta commonly refers to the correlation of the changes in interest rates paid on deposits to changes in benchmark market interest rates the model is also sensitive to the loan and investment prepayment assumptions based on an independent model and the companys historical prepayment data which consider anticipated prepayments under different interest rate environments simulation results are highly dependent on input assumptions to the extent actual behavior is different from the assumptions in the models there could be a material change in interest rate sensitivity the assumptions applied in the model are documented and supported for reasonableness and periodically backtested to assess their effectiveness the company makes appropriate calibrations to the model as needed continually refining the model methodology and results changes to key model assumptions are reviewed by the alco scenario results do not reflect strategies that management could employ to limit the impact of changing interest rate expectations since the federal funds rate range was lowered to near zero between and in march and the federal reserve has committed its resources to support the financial markets business and state and local governments it is not expected that rates will decline further nor is it expected that rates will enter into the negative territory consequently the simulation results for the downward interest rate scenarios as of september are not provided twelvemonth net interest income simulation net interest income simulation modeling looks at interest rate risk through earnings it projects the changes in interest rate sensitive asset and liability cash flows expressed in terms of net interest income over a specified time horizon for defined interest rates scenarios net interest income simulations generate insight into the impact of market rates changes on earnings and guide risk management decisions the company assesses interest rate risk by comparing net interest income using different interest rate scenarios the federal funds rate range was between and as of september and between and as of december after lowering the range to between and in march the federal open market committee fomc pledged to maintain monetary support for the economy moreover in september the majority of fomc members projected that the federal funds rate range will likely remain unchanged through to provide stimulus to the economy which continues to be strained from the impact of the covid19 pandemic the following table presents the companys net interest income sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained nonparallel shift in market interest rates of and basis points in upward direction as of september and in both directions as of december change in interest rates basis points net interest income volatility september december nm nm nm not meaningful the percentage change represents net interest income over months in a stable interest rate environment versus net interest income in the various rate scenarios the companys net interest income profile as of september reflects an asset sensitive position net interest income would be expected to increase if interest rates rise and to decrease if interest rates decline the potential impact of rate decreases is somewhat muted due to the current low rate environment with the federal funds rate floored and the federal funds rate range between and the company is naturally asset sensitive due to the large share of variable rate loans in its loan portfolio which are primarily linked to prime and libor indices the companys interest income is vulnerable to changes in shortterm interest rates the companys deposit portfolio is primarily comprised of nonmaturity deposits which are not directly tied to shortterm interest rate indices but are nevertheless sensitive to changes in shortterm interest rates the companys estimated twelvemonth net interest income sensitivity as of september was higher when compared with the sensitivity as of december for the upward basis point rate scenario while the sensitivity remained relatively consistent for the upward basis point rate scenario this reflects a greater rate of upward repricing in the companys rate sensitive assets which offsets simulated increases in interest expense from higher rates on deposits while there has been an increase in the population of floating rate loans currently at rate floors under the current low rate environment the combined impact from increases in cash and cash equivalents noninterestbearing deposits and a reduction in the base case twelvemonth net interest income resulted in the increased net interest income sensitivity for the upward interest rate scenarios while an instantaneous and sustained nonparallel shift in market interest rates was used in the simulation model described in the preceding paragraphs the company believes that any shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact the rate ramp table below shows the net income volatility under a gradual nonparallel shift upward and downward of the yield curve in even quarterly increments over the first twelve months followed by rates held constant thereafter change in interest rates basis points net interest income volatility september december rate ramp rate ramp rate ramp nm rate ramp nm nm not meaningful the percentage change represents net interest income under a gradual nonparallel shift in even quarterly increments over months the company believes that the rate ramp table shown above when evaluated together with the results of the rate shock simulation presents a more meaningful indication of the potential impact to the companys twelvemonth net interest income in a rising and falling rate scenario during the first nine months of the companys modeled sensitivity slightly decreased under a ramp simulation under the upward interest rate scenarios economic value of equity at risk economic value of equity eve is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows this calculation is used for assetliability management and measures changes in the economic value of the bank the fair market values of a banks assets and liabilities are directly linked to interest rates the economic value approach provides a comparatively broader scope than the net income volatility approach since it captures all anticipated cash flows eve simulation reflects the effect of interest rate shifts on the value of the company and is used to assess the degree of interest rate risk exposure in contrast to the earnings perspective the economic perspective identifies risks arising from repricing or maturity gaps for the life of the balance sheet changes in economic value indicate anticipated changes in the value of the banks future cash flows thus the economic perspective can provide a leading indicator of the banks future earnings and capital values the economic valuation method also reflects those sensitivities across the full maturity spectrum of the banks assets and liabilities the following table presents the companys eve sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained nonparallel shift in market interest rates of and basis points in an upward direction as of september and in both directions as of december change in interest rates basis points eve volatility september december nm nm nm not meaningful the percentage change represents net portfolio value of the company in a stable interest rate environment versus net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios the companys eve sensitivity for the upward interest rate scenarios increased as of september compared with the results as of december the changes in eve sensitivity during this period were primarily due to the reduced base eve the changes in level and shape of the yield curve and large increases in low and noninterestbearing deposits the companys eve profile as of september reflects an asset sensitive eve position under the upward interest rate scenarios given the uncertainty of the magnitude timing and direction of future interest rate movements and the shape of the yield curve actual results may vary from those predicted by the companys model derivatives it is the companys policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices however the company will periodically enter into derivative transactions in order to reduce its exposure to market risks primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the company believes that these derivative transactions when properly structured and managed may provide a hedge against inherent risk in certain assets and liabilities and against risk in specific transactions hedging transactions may be implemented using a variety of derivative instruments such as swaps forwards and options prior to entering into any hedging activities the company analyzes the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to alternative strategies in addition the company enters into derivative transactions in order to assist customers with their risk management objectives primarily to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates foreign currencies and commodity prices to economically hedge against the derivative contracts entered into with the companys customers the company enters into mirrored derivative contracts with thirdparty financial institutions the exposures from derivative transactions are collateralized by cash andor eligible securities based on limits as set forth in the respective agreements entered between the company and the financial institutions the company is subject to credit risk associated with the counterparties to the derivative contracts this counterparty credit risk is a multidimensional form of risk affected by both the exposure and credit quality of the counterparty both of which are sensitive to marketinduced changes the companys credit risk management committee provides oversight of credit risks and the company has guidelines in place to manage counterparty concentration tenor limits and collateral the company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties entering into legally enforceable master netting arrangements and requiring collateral arrangements where possible the company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to institutional third parties through the use of credit risk participation agreements rpas certain derivative contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk the company incorporates credit value adjustments and other market standard methodologies to appropriately reflect its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of its derivatives fair value hedges the company had one and two cancellable interest rate swap contracts as of september and december respectively with original terms of years each these swap contracts involve the exchange of variable rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts the changes in fair value of the hedged brokered certificates of deposit are expected to be effectively offset by the changes in fair value of the swaps throughout the terms of these contracts cash flow hedges as of september the company entered into two interest rate swap contracts designated to hedge against the risk of variable cash flow that the company is exposed to from its variable interest rate borrowings including repurchase agreements and fhlb advances for cash flow hedges the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instruments is recognized in aoci and reclassified to earnings in the same period during which the hedged cash flows impact earnings net investment hedges asc foreign currency matters foreign currency transactions and asc derivatives and hedging allow hedging of the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation the bank entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its investment in east west bank china limited a nonus dollar functional currency subsidiary in china the hedging instruments designated as net investment hedges involve hedging the risk of changes in the us dollar equivalent value of a designated monetary amount of the companys net investment in east west bank china limited against the risk of adverse changes in the foreign currency exchange rate of the chinese renminbi rmb as of september the outstanding foreign currency forwards effectively hedged approximately of the rmb exposure in east west bank china limited the fluctuation in foreign currency translation of the hedged exposure is expected to be offset by changes in the fair value of the forwards interest rate contracts the company offers various interest rate derivative contracts to its customers when derivative transactions are executed with its customers the derivative contracts are offset by paired trades with thirdparty financial institutions including with central clearing organizations certain derivative contracts entered with central clearing organizations are settledtomarket daily to the extent the central clearing organizations rulebooks legally characterize the variation margin as settlement derivative contracts allow borrowers to lock in attractive intermediate and longterm fixed rate financing while not increasing the interest rate risk to the company these transactions are not linked to specific company assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet or to forecasted transactions in a hedging relationship and therefore are economic hedges the contracts are markedtomarket at each reporting period the changes in fair values of the derivative contracts traded with thirdparty financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the derivative transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts except for the credit valuation adjustment component the company records credit valuation adjustments on derivatives to properly reflect the variances of credit worthiness between the company and the counterparties considering the effects of enforceable master netting agreements and collateral arrangements foreign exchange contracts the company enters into foreign exchange contracts with its customers consisting of forward spot swap and option contracts to accommodate the business needs of its customers for the foreign exchange contracts entered into with its customers the company managed its foreign exchange exposure by entering into offsetting foreign exchange contracts with thirdparty financial institutions andor entering into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements with customer counterparties to manage its credit exposure the changes in the fair values entered with thirdparty financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the foreign exchange transactions executed with the customers throughout the terms of these contracts the company also utilizes foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the economic effect of fluctuations in certain foreign currency onbalance sheet assets and liabilities primarily foreign currency denominated deposits offered to its customers the companys policies permit taking proprietary currency positions within approved limits in compliance with the proprietary trading exemption provided under section of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act the company does not speculate in the foreign exchange markets and actively manages its foreign exchange exposures within prescribed risk limits and defined controls credit contracts the company may periodically enter into rpas to manage the credit exposure on interest rate contracts associated with its syndicated loans the company may enter into protection sold or protection purchased rpas with institutional counterparties under the rpa the company will receive or make a payment if a borrower defaults on the related interest rate contract the company manages its credit risk on the rpas by monitoring the credit worthiness of the borrowers which is based on the companys normal credit review process equity contracts as part of the loan origination process the company periodically obtains warrants to purchase preferred andor common stock of technology and life sciences companies to which it provides loans the warrants included on the consolidated financial statements were from public and private companies commodity contracts the company enters into energy commodity contracts with its customers to allow them to hedge against the risk of fluctuation in energy commodity prices to economically hedge against the risk of fluctuation in commodity prices in the products offered to its customers the company enters into offsetting commodity contracts with thirdparty financial institutions including with central clearing organizations certain derivative contracts entered with central clearing organizations are settled to market daily to the extent the central clearing organizations rulebooks legally characterize the variation margin as settlement the changes in fair values of the energy commodity contracts traded with thirdparty financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the energy commodity transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts additional information on the companys derivatives is presented in note summary of significant accounting policies derivatives to the consolidated financial statements of the companys form 10k note fair value measurement and fair value of financial instruments and note derivatives to the consolidated financial statements of this form 10q impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared according to gaap which require the measurement of financial and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs and the effect that inflation may have on both shortterm and longterm interest rates since almost all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institutions performance than do general levels of inflation while inflation expectations do affect interest rates interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services critical accounting policies and estimates the companys significant accounting policies and use of estimates are fundamental to understanding its results of operations and financial condition some accounting policies by their nature are inherently subject to estimation techniques valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments in addition some significant accounting policies require significant judgments in applying complex accounting principles to individual transaction and determining the most appropriate treatment the company has procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments for significant accounting policies and use of estimates of allowance for credit losses see note current accounting developments and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10q and for all other significant accounting policies and use of estimates see note summary of significant accounting policies of the companys form 10k certain accounting policies are considered to have a critical effect on the companys consolidated financial statements in the companys judgment critical accounting policies are defined as those that require the most complex or subjective judgments and are reflective of significant uncertainties and whose actual results could differ from the companys estimates future changes in the key variables could change future valuations and impact the results of operations in each area the company has identified the most important variables in the estimation process the company has used the best information available to make the estimations necessary for the related assets and liabilities the following accounting policies are critical to the companys consolidated financial statements as they require management to make subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain where actual results could differ materially from the companys estimates fair value of financial instruments allowance for credit losses goodwill impairment and income taxes recently issued accounting

significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10q supplemental information explanation of gaap to nongaap financial measures to supplement the companys unaudited interim consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap the company uses certain nongaap measures of financial performance nongaap financial measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to gaap generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a companys performance that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap a nongaap financial measure may also be a financial metric that is not required by gaap or other applicable requirements the company believes these nongaap financial measures when taken together with the corresponding gaap financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance and allow comparability to prior periods these nongaap financial measures may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies limiting their usefulness for

to differ possibly materially from the companys forwardlooking statements due to factors and future developments that are uncertain unpredictable and in many cases beyond the companys control given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances it is difficult to predict the full impact of the covid19 pandemic on the companys business the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts the company will depend on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable including the scope severity and duration of the pandemic and its impact on the companys customers the actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic as well as its impact on global and regional economies and the pace of recovery when the covid19 pandemic subsides among others for a more detailed
