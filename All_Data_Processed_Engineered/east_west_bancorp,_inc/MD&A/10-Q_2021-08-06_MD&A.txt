insignificant delay in the timing of the restructured payment period relative to the payment frequency under the loans original contractual maturity or expected duration the covid19 pandemicrelated loan modifications primarily consisted of payment deferrals six months or less in duration in the form of either principal payment deferrals where the borrower was still paying interest or full principal and interest payment deferrals other forbearance programs consisted of interest rate concessions the deferred payments for commercial loans are either repaid at contractual maturity or spread over the remaining contractual term of the loan the deferred payments for consumer loans are repaid under defined payment plans between six to months after the deferral period ends or the loan term is extended beyond the contractual maturity by the number of payments deferred as of june the company had million of loans under payment deferral and forbearance programs a decrease of million or from million as of december the loans on deferral as of june and december largely consisted of cre and residential mortgage loans the yeartodate decrease in loans on deferral reflected the lifting of covid19 related business shutdowns and restrictions on travel and restaurant dining the increase of cre covid19 related loan deferrals that were making at least partial payments from as of december to

relief programs on an ongoing basis the impacts of the covid19 loan modifications were considered in the determination of the allowance for credit loss allowance for credit losses the companys measurement of the allowance for credit losses is based on managements best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the companys relevant financial assets the allowance for credit losses estimate uses various models and estimation techniques based on historical loss experience current borrower characteristics current conditions reasonable and supportable forecasts and other relevant factors in the case of loans and securities allowance for credit losses are contraasset valuation accounts that are deducted from the amortized cost basis of these assets to present the net amount expected to be collected in the case of unfunded credit commitments the allowance for credit losses is a liability account that is reported as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet in addition to the allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for unfunded credit commitments the company has three general areas for which it provides the allowance for unfunded credit commitments recourse obligations for loans sold letters of credit and unfunded lending commitments the companys methodology for determining the allowance for unfunded lending commitments calculation uses the lifetime loss rates of the onbalance sheet commitment recourse obligations for loans sold and letters of credit use the weighted loss rates for the segment of the individual credit the company is committed to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at a level that is commensurate with the estimated inherent losses in the loan portfolio including unfunded credit facilities while the company believes that the allowance for credit losses as of june was appropriate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and in unfunded credit commitments based on the information available future allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a variety of factors including but not limited to accounting standard and regulatory changes loan growth portfolio performance and general economic conditions for a description of the policies methodologies and judgments used to determine the allowance for credit losses see

market risk is the risk that the companys financial condition may change resulting from adverse movements in market rates or prices including interest rates foreign exchange rates interest rate contracts investment securities prices credit spreads and related risk resulting from mismatches in rate sensitive assets and liabilities in the event of market stress the risk could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition the boards risk oversight committee has primary oversight responsibility over market risk management at the management level the alco establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market risk management activities corporate treasury supports the alco in measuring monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks interest rate risk management interest rate risk results primarily from the companys traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans which is the primary area of market risk for the company economic and financial conditions movements in interest rates and consumer preferences impact the level of noninterestbearing funding sources at the company as well as affect the difference between the interest the company earns on interestearning assets and pays on interestbearing liabilities in addition changes in interest rates can influence the rate of principal prepayments on loans and the speed of deposit withdrawals due to the pricing term mismatches and the embedded options inherent in certain products changes in market interest rates not only affect expected nearterm earnings but also the economic value of these interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities other market risks include foreign currency exchange risk and equity price risk these risks are not considered significant to the company and no separate quantitative information concerning these risks is presented herein with oversight by the companys board of directors the alco coordinates the overall management of the companys interest rate risk the alco meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing the companys open market positions and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk management of interest rate risk is carried out primarily through strategies involving the companys debt securities portfolio loans portfolio available funding channels and capital market activities in addition the companys policies permit the use of derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk the interest rate risk exposure is measured and monitored through various risk management tools which include a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analyses under multiple interest rate scenarios the model incorporates the companys cash instruments loans debt securities resale agreements deposits borrowings and repurchase agreements as well as financial instruments from the companys foreign operations the company uses both a static balance sheet and a forward growth balance sheet to perform these analyses the simulated interest rate scenarios include a nonparallel shift in the yield curve rate shock and a gradual nonparallel shift in the yield curve rate ramp in addition the company also performs simulations using alternative interest rate scenarios including various permutations of the yield curve flattening steepening or inverting results of these various simulations are used to formulate and gauge strategies to achieve a desired risk profile within the companys capital and liquidity guidelines the net interest income simulation model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of the companys interestrate sensitive assets liabilities and related derivative contracts it also incorporates various assumptions which management believes to be reasonable but may have a significant impact on results these assumptions include but are not limited to the timing and magnitude of changes in interest rates the yield curve evolution and shape the correlation between various interest rate indices financial instrument future repricing characteristics and spread relative to benchmark rates and the effect of interest rate floors and caps the modeled results are highly sensitive to deposit decay and deposit beta assumptions which are derived from a regression analysis of the companys historical deposit data deposit beta commonly refers to the correlation of the changes in interest rates paid on deposits to changes in benchmark interest rates the model is also sensitive to the loan and investment prepayment assumptions based on an independent model and the companys historical prepayment data which consider anticipated prepayments under different interest rate environments simulation results are highly dependent on input assumptions to the extent actual behavior is different from the assumptions in the models there could be a material change in interest rate sensitivity the assumptions applied in the model are documented and supported for reasonableness and periodically backtested to assess their effectiveness the company makes appropriate calibrations to the model as needed continually refining the model methodology and results changes to key model assumptions are reviewed by the alco scenario results do not reflect strategies that management could employ to limit the impact of changing interest rate expectations since the federal funds rate range was lowered to near zero in march and the federal reserve has committed its resources to support the financial markets business and state and local governments it is not expected that rates will decline further nor is it expected that rates will enter into the negative territory consequently the simulation results for the downward interest rate scenarios as of june are not provided twelvemonth net interest income simulation net interest income simulation modeling looks at interest rate risk through earnings it projects the changes in interest rate sensitive asset and liability cash flows expressed in terms of net interest income over a specified time horizon for defined interest rates scenarios net interest income simulations generate insight into the impact of market rates changes on earnings and guide risk management decisions the company assesses interest rate risk by comparing net interest income using different interest rate scenarios the federal funds target rate range was as of both june and december after lowering the range to between and in march the federal open market committee fomc pledged to maintain monetary support for the economy however in june the fomc citing increasing signs of inflationary pressures indicated that rate increases will likely be implemented as early as during the june meeting the fomc also indicated it would hold the nearterm federal funds target rate at between and current market expectations are for two rate hikes in the following table presents the companys net interest income sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained nonparallel shift in market interest rates of and basis points in upward direction as of june and december change in interest rates basis points net interest income volatility june december nm nm nm nm nm not meaningful the percentage change represents net interest income over months in a stable interest rate environment versus net interest income in the various rate scenarios the companys net interest income profile as of june reflects an asset sensitive position net interest income would be expected to increase if interest rates rise and to decrease if interest rates decline the potential impact of rate decreases is somewhat muted due to the current low rate environment with the federal funds rate floored and the federal funds rate range between and the company is naturally asset sensitive due to the large share of variable rate loans in its loan portfolio which are primarily linked to prime and libor indices the companys interest income is vulnerable to changes in shortterm interest rates however given the current low level of interest rates the potential for further rate decreases is limited which reduces the banks exposure to risks associated with falling rates the companys deposit portfolio is primarily comprised of nonmaturity deposits which are not directly tied to shortterm interest rate indices but are nevertheless sensitive to changes in shortterm interest rates the companys estimated twelvemonth net interest income sensitivity as of june was slightly higher as compared with the sensitivity as of december under both higher rate scenarios this reflects both an increased asset rate sensitivity in the companys assets and an increase in noninterest bearing deposits while an instantaneous and sustained nonparallel shift in market interest rates was used in the simulation model described in the preceding paragraphs the company believes that any shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact the rate ramp table below shows

interest rates basis points net interest income volatility june december rate ramp rate ramp rate ramp nm nm rate ramp nm nm nm not meaningful the percentage change represents net interest income under a gradual nonparallel shift in even quarterly increments over months the company believes that the rate ramp table shown above when evaluated together with the results of the rate shock simulation presents a more meaningful indication of the potential impact of rising interest rates to the companys twelvemonth net interest income during the second quarter of the companys modeled asset sensitivity increased under simulations for the up and up basis point ramp scenarios economic value of equity at risk economic value of equity eve is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows this calculation is used for assetliability management and measures changes in the economic value of the bank the fair market values of a banks assets and liabilities are directly linked to interest rates the economic value approach provides a comparatively broader scope than the net income volatility approach since it captures all anticipated cash flows eve simulation reflects the effect of interest rate shifts on the value of the company and is used to assess the degree of interest rate risk exposure in contrast to the earnings perspective the economic perspective identifies risks arising from repricing or maturity gaps over the life of the balance sheet changes in economic value indicate anticipated changes in the value of the banks future cash flows thus the economic perspective can provide a leading indicator of the banks future earnings and capital values the economic value method also reflects sensitivity across the full maturity spectrum of the banks assets and liabilities the following table presents the companys eve sensitivity related to an

december nm nm nm nm nm not meaningful the percentage change represents net portfolio value of the company in a stable interest rate environment versus net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios the companys eve sensitivity for the upward interest rate scenarios decreased as of june compared with the results as of december the changes in eve sensitivity during this period were primarily due to changes in level and shape of the yield curve the companys eve profile as of june reflects an asset sensitive eve position under the higher interest rate scenarios given the uncertainty of the magnitude timing and direction of future interest rate movements and the shape of the yield curve actual results may vary from those predicted by the companys model derivatives it is the companys policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices however the company will periodically enter into derivative transactions in order to reduce its exposure to market risks primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the company believes that these derivative transactions when properly structured and managed may provide a hedge against inherent risk in certain assets and liabilities and against risk in specific transactions hedging transactions may be implemented using a variety of derivative instruments such as swaps forwards and options prior to entering into any hedging activities the company analyzes the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to alternative strategies in addition the company enters into derivative transactions in order to assist customers with their risk management objectives such as managing exposure to fluctuations in interest rates foreign currencies and commodity prices to economically hedge against the derivative contracts entered into with the companys customers the company enters into mirrored derivative contracts with thirdparty financial institutions the exposures from derivative transactions are collateralized by cash andor eligible securities based on limits as set forth in the respective agreements entered between the company and counterparty financial institutions the company is subject to credit risk associated with the counterparties to the derivative contracts this counterparty credit risk is a multidimensional form of risk affected by both the exposure and credit quality of the counterparty both of which are sensitive to marketinduced changes the companys credit risk management committee provides oversight of credit risks and the company has guidelines in place to manage counterparty concentration tenor limits and collateral the company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties by entering into legally enforceable master netting arrangements and by requiring collateral arrangements where possible the company may also transfer counterparty credit riskrelated to interest rate swaps to institutional third parties through the use of credit risk participation agreements certain derivative contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk the company incorporates credit value adjustments and other market standard methodologies to appropriately reflect its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements of its derivatives the following table summarizes certain information concerning derivative
