obligations to other counterparties as they come due or to obtain adequate funding at a reasonable cost to meet those obligations liquidity risk also considers the stability of deposits the objective of liquidity management is to manage the potential mismatch of asset and liability cash flows maintaining an adequate level of liquidity depends on the institutions ability to efficiently meet both expected and unexpected cash flows and collateral needs without adversely affecting daily operations or the financial condition of the institution to achieve this objective the company analyzes its

market risk factors including interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices and credit spreads the company is primarily exposed to interest rate risk through its core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits there have been no significant changes in our risk management practices as described in item mda market risk management in the companys form 10k interest rate risk management interest rate risk results primarily from the companys traditional banking activities of gathering deposits and extending loans which are the primary areas of market risk for the company the alco coordinates the overall management of the companys interest rate risk meets regularly to review the companys open market positions and establishes policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk interest rate risk management is carried out primarily through strategies involving the companys debt securities portfolio loan portfolio available funding channels and capital market activities in addition the companys policies permit the use of derivative instruments to assist in managing interest rate risk interest rate risk exposure is measured and monitored through various risk management tools which include a simulation model that performs interest rate sensitivity analyses under multiple interest rate scenarios against a baseline the simulation model incorporates the markets forward rate expectations and the companys earning assets and liabilities the net interest income simulation model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of the companys interestrate sensitive assets liabilities and related derivative contracts it also incorporates various assumptions which management believes to be reasonable but may have a significant impact on the results simulation results are highly dependent on input assumptions to the extent the actual behavior is different from the assumptions used in the models there could be material changes in interest rate sensitivity results the assumptions applied in the model are documented supported and periodically backtested to assess the reasonableness and effectiveness for a more detailed discussion of the companys interest income simulation model refer to item mda market risk management in the companys form 10k the federal reserve continued its aggressive response to inflation by incrementally raising the target range for the fed funds rate to a range of to in march from the yearend range of to on may the federal reserve raised the target rate range to to however increased uncertainty regarding a potential recession has also led to the expectation of rate cuts potentially starting in september twelvemonth net interest income simulation net interest income simulation modeling measures interest rate risk through earnings volatility the simulation projects the cash flow changes in interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities expressed in terms of net interest income over a specified time horizon for defined interest rate scenarios net interest income simulations provide insight into the impact of market rate changes on earnings which help guide risk management decisions the company assesses interest rate risk by comparing the changes of net interest income in different interest rate scenarios the following table presents the companys net interest income sensitivity related to an instantaneous and sustained nonparallel shift in market interest rates by and bps as of march and december based on a static balance sheet as of the date of the analysis net interest income volatility change in interest rates in bps march december the percentage change represents net interest income change over a 12month period in a stable interest rate environment versus in the various interest rate scenarios the composition of the companys loan portfolio creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to a mismatch of repricing behavior between the floatingrate loan portfolio and deposit products in the table above net interest income volatility expressed in relation to basecase net interest income decreased quarter overquarter primarily as a result of changes in the companys balance sheet composition while an instantaneous and sustained nonparallel shift in market interest rates was used in the simulation model described in the preceding paragraph the company also models scenarios based on gradual shifts in interest rates and assesses the corresponding impacts these interest rate scenarios provide additional information to estimate the companys underlying interest rate risk the rate ramp table below shows the net interest income volatility under a gradual nonparallel shift of the yield curve in even monthly increments over the first months followed by rates held constant thereafter based on a static balance sheet as of the date of the analysis net interest income volatility change in interest rates in bps march december rate ramp rate ramp rate ramp rate ramp as of march the companys net interest income profile reflects an asset sensitive position net interest income is expected to increase when interest rates rise as the company has a large population of variable rate loans primarily linked to prime libor and term sofr indices the companys interest income is sensitive to changes in shortterm interest rates as of march the company designated interest rate contracts with a notional amount of billion as cash flow hedges the modeled results incorporated an additional billion of interest rate contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges during april the increase in the total notional amount of cash flow hedges to billion reduced net interest income volatility by approximately of the base net interest income for every bps change in interest rates the companys deposit portfolio is primarily composed of nonmaturity deposits which are not directly tied to shortterm interest rate indices but are nevertheless sensitive to changes in shortterm interest rates the modeled results are highly sensitive to deposit durations beta deposit mix and other behavioral assumptions which were derived using a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches actual results may deviate from the model results in terms of net interest income due to earning asset growth variation and deposit mix changes based on customer preferences relative to the interest rate environment during a period of declining interest rates balance sheet growth could offset headwinds to net interest income from yield compression economic value of equity at risk economic value of equity eve is a cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows this calculation is used for assetliability management and measures changes in the economic value of the bank the economic value approach provides a comparatively broader scope than the net interest income volatility approach since it represents the discounted present value of cash flows over the expected life of the instruments due to this longer horizon eve is useful to identify risks arising from repricing prepayment and maturity gaps between assets and liabilities on the balance sheet as well as from offbalance sheet derivative exposure over their lifetime this longterm economic perspective into the companys interest rate risk profile allows the company to identify anticipated negative effects of interest rate fluctuations however the difference in time horizons can cause the eve analysis to diverge from the shorter term net interest income analysis presented above given the uncertainty of the magnitude timing and direction of future interest rate movements the shape of the yield curve and potential changes to the balance sheet actual results may vary from those predicted by the companys model the following table presents the companys eve sensitivity related to an instantaneous nonparallel shift in market interest rates by and bps as of march and december eve volatility change in interest rates in bps march december the percentage change represents net portfolio value change of the company in a stable interest rate environment versus in the various interest rate scenarios as of march the companys eve profile reflects a liability sensitive position as the companys eve is expected to decrease when interest rates rise the eve sensitivity decreased quarteroverquarter primarily due to increases in fixedrate shortterm borrowings and cash and cash equivalents derivatives it is the companys policy not to speculate on the future direction of interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices however the company periodically enters into derivative transactions in order to manage its exposure to market risk primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency risk the company believes these derivative transactions when properly structured and managed provides a hedge against inherent risk in certain assets and liabilities or against risk in specific transactions hedging transactions may be implemented using a variety of derivative instruments such as swaps forwards options and collars the company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in interest payments received on certain floatingrate commercial loans and interest payments paid on certain floatingrate borrowings foreign exchange derivatives are used in net investment hedging strategies to mitigate the risk of changes in the us dollar equivalent value of a designated monetary amount of the companys net investment in east west bank china limited prior to entering into any accounting hedge activities the company analyzes the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to alternative strategies the company also repositions its hedging derivatives portfolio based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate and foreign currency environments balance sheet composition and trends and the relative mix of its cash and derivative positions in addition the company enters into derivative transactions in order to accommodate its customers with their business needs or to assist customers with their risk management objectives such as managing exposure to fluctuations in interest rates foreign currencies and commodity prices to economically hedge against the derivative contracts entered into with the companys customers the company enters into offsetting derivative contracts with thirdparty financial institutions some of which are cleared through central clearing organizations the exposures from derivative transactions are collateralized by cash andor eligible securities based on limits as set forth in the respective agreements between the company and counterparty financial institutions the changes in fair values of the derivative contracts traded with thirdparty financial institutions are expected to be largely comparable to the changes in fair values of the derivative transactions executed with customers throughout the terms of these contracts except for the credit valuation adjustment component in the contracts and the spread variances between the customer derivatives and the offsetting financial counterparty positions the company also utilizes foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate the economic effect of fluctuations in certain foreign currency onbalance sheet assets and liabilities primarily foreign currency denominated deposits offered to its customers the company is subject to credit risk associated with the counterparties to the derivative contracts this counterparty credit risk is a multidimensional form of risk affected by both the exposure and credit quality of the counterparty both of which are sensitive to marketinduced changes the companys credit risk management committee provides oversight of credit risk and the company has guidelines in place to manage counterparty concentration tenor limits and collateral the company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements and by requiring collateral arrangements where possible the company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to institutional thirdparties through the use of credit risk participation agreements certain derivative contracts are required to be cleared through central clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk where variation margin is applied daily as settlement to the fair value of the derivative contracts in addition the company incorporates credit value adjustments and other market standard methodologies to appropriately reflect the counterpartys and its own nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement of its derivatives as of march the company anticipates performance by its counterparties and has not incurred any related credit losses the following
