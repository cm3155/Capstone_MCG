item risk factors in the course of conducting its businesses the company is exposed to a variety of risks some of which are inherent to the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to the companys businesses the companys enterprise risk management erm program incorporates risk management throughout the organization in identifying managing monitoring and reporting risks our erm program identifies the companys major risk categories as risks related to the covid19 pandemic geopolitical uncertainties financial risks capital and liquidity risks credit risk operational risk regulatory compliance and legal risks accounting and tax risks and strategic and reputational risks the erm is comprised of senior management of the company and chaired by the chief risk officer the discussion below addresses material factors of which we are currently aware that could have a material and adverse effect on our businesses results of operations and financial condition many of the following risks and uncertainties are and will be exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result these risk factors and other forwardlooking statements that relate to future events expectations trends and operating periods involve certain factors that are subject to change and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially these risks and uncertainties should not be considered a complete discussion of all the risks and uncertainties the company may face and although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is discussed separately many are interrelated risks related to the covid19 pandemic the effects of the covid19 pandemic have impacted and may continue to impact the companys businesses financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations and the extent and duration of these impacts depend on future developments which remain uncertain and cannot be predicted the covid19 pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic have had and will likely continue to have a severe impact on global economic conditions including disruption and volatility in the financial markets disruption of global supply chains temporary closures or failures of businesses increased unemployment and the imposition of social distancing and restrictions on movement in the us and other countries east west bank is considered an essential business in the seven states where we have branches or office locations in response to the covid19 pandemic and to enhanced health and safety measures the company has implemented business continuity plans prepared all east west bank facilities with employee safety protocols including personal protection equipment visual safety reminders related to social distancing social distancing markers temperature checks and sanitary products and continued to provide financial services to our customers subsequent waves of the covid19 pandemic may negatively affect our ability to provide services due to increased illnesses among our employees quarantines new stayathome orders or other restrictions on our employees or the safety measures implemented to prevent illnesses of our employees including the potential closure of particular branches and certain employees working remotely governments and regulatory authorities worldwide have taken and may continue to take measures to stabilize the markets and support economic growth however the success of these measures is unknown and these measures may not be sufficient to address the negative economic effects of the covid19 pandemic or to avert severe and prolonged slowdowns in economic activity we may face increased cybersecurity risks due to the shifting of a majority of our corporate and division office functions to operating remotely in regions impacted by stayathome orders increased levels of remote access may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to attempt to exploit vulnerabilities and our employees may be more susceptible to phishing and social engineering attempts due to increased stress caused by the crisis and from balancing family and work responsibilities at home in addition our technological resources may be strained due to the number of remote users the conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic could continue to adversely affect the ability of the companys borrowers to satisfy their obligations given that many of the companys loans are secured by real estate a potential decline in real estate markets could further impact the companys business and financial condition and the credit quality of the companys loan portfolio in addition some of the companys business customers are in volatile businesses and industries which are sensitive to global economic conditions supply chain disruptions andor commodity prices any decline in these businesses and industries could cause decreased borrowings and potentially increase credit losses which in turn could adversely affect the companys financial condition if unemployment continues to rise and our customers experience credit deterioration including inability to pay loans as they come due or a decrease in the value of collateral andor higher than usual draws on outstanding lines of credit our level of chargeoffs and provision for credit losses could continue to increase further the disruptions related to the covid19 pandemic may decrease our borrowers confidence with respect to purchasing real estate or homes and adversely affect the demand for the companys loans and other products and services the valuation of our loans securities derivatives portfolios goodwill and intangibles the carrying value of our deferred tax assets our capital levels and liquidity and our results of operations in addition the unprecedented developments relating to the covid19 pandemic have contributed to heightened volatility in financial markets in the us and worldwide the continuation of prolonged adverse economic conditions primarily in the us andor greater china can be expected to have adverse effects on the companys businesses results of operations and financial condition market declines or volatility due to the covid19 pandemic could have material impacts on the value of securities derivatives and other financial instruments which the company owns the company executes transactions with various counterparties in the financial industry including brokerdealers commercial banks and investment banks and defaults by financial services institutions and uncertainty in the financial services industry in general could lead to marketwide liquidity problems and may expose the company to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparties or clients and further increase the possibility of downgrades in the companys credit ratings any further measures undertaken by governmental authorities to address the covid19 pandemic could significantly disrupt or prevent us from operating our business in the ordinary course for an extended period which could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition economic distress due to the covid19 pandemic could exacerbate these effects additionally the earnings impact from recent and continued emergency interest rate cuts could further compress interest margins which could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition the extent to which the covid19 pandemic and associated economic downturn continue to impact our businesses results of operations and financial condition is uncertain and will depend on numerous evolving factors that are outside our control and cannot be accurately predicted including the scope severity and duration of the pandemic the governmental business and individual actions in response to the pandemic the impact of those actions on global economic activities and the pace of economic recovery when the covid19 pandemic subsides the impact of the us federal government actions to mitigate the effects of the covid19 pandemic and our participation in those efforts may materially and adversely affect our businesses results of operations and financial condition the us federal government has taken significant action to address the economic and financial effects of the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve has sharply reduced interest rates and instituted quantitative easing measures as well as domestic and global capital market support programs in addition congress various federal agencies and state governments have taken measures to address the economic and social consequences of the pandemic including the enactment on march of the cares act which among other things established various initiatives to protect individuals businesses and local economies in an effort to lessen the impact of the covid19 pandemic on consumers and businesses these initiatives included the ppp funding and authority for the federal reserve and us department of treasury to establish the main street lending program mslp relief with respect to tdrs mortgage forbearance and extended unemployment benefits in response to the continued market disruption and economic impact of the covid19 pandemic the president signed into law the caa on december the caa extended some of these relief provisions in certain respects as well as provided other forms of relief the ppp permitted small businesses sole proprietorships independent contractors and selfemployed individuals to apply for forgivable loans from existing sba lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria the cares act appropriated billion to fund the ppp and congress appropriated an additional billion for ppp commitments on april and amended the ppp on june to make the terms of the ppp loans and loan forgiveness more flexible from april to august we accepted ppp applications and originated loans to qualified small businesses under this program consistent with the terms of the ppp these loans carry an interest rate of and are guaranteed by the sba the substantial majority of the companys ppp loans have a term of two years the federal reserve established the ppplf to enable federal reserve banks to extend credit to financial institutions that originate ppp loans while taking the ppp loans as collateral earlier in we borrowed under the ppplf by pledging ppp loans as collateral and paid down all borrowings in the month of october the caa provided additional funding to the ppp expanded eligibility of business for the ppp extended the ppp to march and allowed eligible borrowers to obtain a second ppp loan with a maximum amount of million in january the company began processing applications under this latest round of the sbas ppp the bank was also a participating lender in the mslp which was established by the federal reserve to support lending to small and mediumsized businesses and nonprofit organizations that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the covid19 pandemic the companys participation in these programs could subject us to increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny negative publicity or increased exposure to litigation which could increase our operational legal and compliance costs and damage our reputation moreover if the federal stimulus measures are not effective in mitigating the effect of the covid19 pandemic credit issues for our loan customers may be severe and adversely affect our businesses results of operations and financial condition more substantially over a longer period of time the cares act as amended by the caa and related guidance from the federal banking agencies provide financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend requirements under the us generally accepted accounting principles gaap related to classification of certain loan modifications as tdrs to account for the current and anticipated effects of the covid19 pandemic the cares act also includes a range of other provisions designed to support the us economy and mitigate the impact of the covid19 pandemic on financial institutions and their customers among other provisions sections and of the cares act respectively require mortgage servicers to grant on a borrowers request forbearance for up to days which can be extended for an additional days on a federallybacked singlefamily mortgage loan or forbearance up to days which can be extended for two additional 30day periods on a federallybacked multifamily mortgage loan when the borrowers experience financial hardship due to the covid19 pandemic further in response to the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve implemented a number of facilities in addition to the ppplf and mslp to provide emergency liquidity to various segments of the us economy and financial markets many of these facilities expired december or were extended for brief periods into the expiration of these facilities could have adverse effect on us economy and ultimately on our businesses financial condition and results of operations in response to the covid19 pandemic all of the federal banking regulatory agencies have encouraged lenders to extend additional loans and the federal government is considering additional stimulus and support legislation focused on providing aid to various sectors including small businesses the full impact on our business activities as a result of government and regulatory policies programs and guidelines as well as regulators reactions to such activities remains uncertain risks related to geopolitical uncertainties unfavorable general economic political or industry conditions either domestically or internationally may adversely affect our businesses results of operations and financial condition our businesses and results of operations are affected by the financial markets and general economic conditions in the us and greater china including factors such as the level and volatility of shortterm and longterm interest rates inflation deflation home prices unemployment and underemployment levels bankruptcies household income consumer behavior fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies liquidity of the global financial markets the availability and cost of capital and credit investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets and sustainability of economic growth in the us and greater china the deterioration of any of these conditions could adversely affect our consumer and commercial businesses our securities and derivatives portfolios our level of chargeoffs and provision for credit losses the carrying value of our deferred tax assets our capital levels liquidity and our results of operations in addition because the companys operations and the collateral securing its real estate lending portfolio are concentrated in northern and southern california the company may be particularly susceptible to the adverse economic conditions in the state of california any unfavorable changes in the economic and market conditions could lead to the following risks the process the company uses to estimate the expected losses in the companys credit exposure requires difficult subjective and complex judgments including consideration of how these economic conditions might impair the ability of the borrowers to repay their loans the level of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of the companys estimates of expected losses in the companys credit exposure which may in turn adversely impact the companys results of operations and financial condition the companys commercial and residential borrowers may not be able to make timely repayments of their loans or a decrease in the value of real estate collateral securing the payment of such loans could result in credit losses delinquencies foreclosures and customer bankruptcies any of which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations and financial condition a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services a decrease in deposit balances future disruptions in the capital markets or other events including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations may result in an inability to borrow on favorable terms or at all from other financial institutions the value of the afs debt securities portfolio that the company holds may be adversely affected by debt defaults and a loss of confidence in the financial services industry our market sector and the equity markets by investors placing pressure on the companys stock price changes in the us and greater china trade policies including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs may adversely impact the companys business results of operations and financial condition there have been ongoing discussions regarding potential changes to trade policies legislation treaties and tariffs between the us and greater china tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed and proposed changes in tariffs retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that the companys customers import or export could cause the prices of their products to increase possibly reduce demand and hence may negatively impact the companys customer margins and their ability to service debt the company may also experience a decrease in the demand for loans and other financial products or experience a deterioration in the credit quality of the loans extended to the customers whose industry sectors that are most sensitive to the tariffs we face risks associated with international operations a substantial number of our customers have economic and cultural ties to asia the banks international presence includes four fullservice branches and four representative offices in greater china our presence in greater china carries certain risks including risks arising from the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate revenues from foreign operations risks associated with leveraging and conducting business on an international basis including among others legal regulatory and tax requirements and restrictions crossborder trade restrictions or tariffs uncertainties regarding liability trade barriers difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations political and economic risks and financial risks including currency and payment risks additionally our business could be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of disease pandemics including the current spread of the covid19 pandemic any outbreak of disease pandemics and other adverse public health developments particularly in asia could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations these could include temporary closures of our branches and offices and reduced consumer spending in the impacted regions or in the us depending upon the severity globally which could adversely impact our operating results and the performance of loans to impacted borrowers in greater china or in the us in addition a significant outbreak of disease pandemics in the human population specifically the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that have had and continue to adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries resulting in an economic downturn that could adversely affect our customers financial results further volatility in the shanghai and hong kong stock exchanges andor a potential fall in real estate prices in china among other things may negatively impact asset values and the profitability and liquidity of the companys customers operating in this region these risks could adversely affect the success of our international operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall business results of operations and financial condition in addition we face risks that our employees and affiliates may fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing our international operations including the us foreign corrupt practices act anticorruption laws and other us and foreign laws and regulations failure to comply with such laws and regulations could among other things result in enforcement actions and fines against us as well as limitations on our conduct any of which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations and financial condition natural disasters and geopolitical events beyond the companys control could adversely affect the company natural disasters such as wildfires earthquakes extreme weather conditions hurricanes floods widespread health emergencies or disease pandemics and other acts of nature and geopolitical events involving political unrest terrorism or military conflicts could adversely affect the companys business operations and those of the companys customers and cause substantial damage and loss to real and personal property for example california in which the companys operations and the collateral securing its real estate lending portfolio are concentrated contains active earthquake zones and has been and continues to be subject to numerous devastating wildfires these natural disasters and geopolitical events could impair borrowers ability to service their loans decrease the level and duration of deposits by customers erode the value of loan collateral and result in an increase in the amount of nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and provision for credit losses which could adversely affect the companys businesses results of operations and financial condition risks related to financial matters a portion of the companys loan portfolio is secured by real estate and thus the company has a higher degree of risk from a downturn in real estate markets because many of the companys loans are secured by real estate a decline in the real estate markets could impact the companys business and financial condition real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by changes in general economic conditions fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes regulations and policies and natural disasters such as wildfires and earthquakes which are particular to california where a significant portion of the companys real estate collateral is located if real estate values decline the value of real estate collateral securing the companys loans could be significantly reduced the companys ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would be further diminished and the company would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans furthermore commercial real estate cre and multifamily loans typically involve large balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers since payments on these loans are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties as well as the business and financial condition of the borrowers repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market adverse economic conditions or changes in applicable government regulations borrowers inability to repay such loans may have an adverse effect on the companys businesses results of operations and financial condition the companys businesses are subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on the companys financial performance our financial results depend substantially on net interest income which is the difference between the interest income we earn on interestearning assets and the interest expense we pay on interestbearing liabilities interestearning assets primarily include loans extended securities held in our investment portfolio and excess cash held to manage shortterm liquidity we fund our assets using deposits and borrowings while we offer interestbearing deposit products a portion of our deposit balances are from noninterestbearing products overall the interest rates we receive on our interestearning assets and pay on our interestbearing liabilities could be affected by a variety of factors including market interest rate changes competition regulatory requirements and a change in our product mix changes in key variable market interest rates such as the federal funds national prime libor or treasury rates generally impact our interest rate spread because of the differences in maturities and repricing characteristics of the companys interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interestearning assets and interest expense paid on interestbearing liabilities increases in interest rates may result in a change in the mix of noninterest and interestbearing deposit accounts rising interest rates may cause our funding costs to increase at a faster pace than the yield we earn on our assets ultimately causing our net interest margin to decrease higher interest rates may also result in lower mortgage production income and increased chargeoffs in certain segments of the loan portfolio such as cre and home equity in contrast declining interest rates would increase the banks lending capacity decrease funding cost increase prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs accordingly changes in levels of interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest income net interest margin cost of deposits loan origination volume average loan portfolio balance asset quality liquidity and overall profitability reforms to and uncertainty regarding libor may adversely affect our business on july the united kingdom uks financial conduct authority fca which regulates libor announced that it will no longer compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after in june us federal reserve banks alternative reference rates committee arrc selected the sofr as the preferred alternative rate to libor sofr differs from libor in two key respects sofr is a single overnight rate while libor includes rates of several tenors and sofr is deemed a credit riskfree rate while libor incorporates an evaluation of credit risk in addition the sofr methodology has not been tested for an extended period of time which may limit market acceptance of the use of sofr the arrc and other entities intend for the transition to be economically neutral during the arrc has issued updated hardwired fallback language for bilateral business loans and syndicated loans and a recommended spread methodology for nonconsumer cash products as well as guidance on several matters related to the transition on october the international swaps and derivatives association inc isda launched its ibor fallbacks supplement supplement and ibor fallbacks protocol protocol the supplement amended isdas standard definitions for interest rate derivatives to incorporate robust fallbacks for derivatives linked to certain ibors with the changes effective on january from that date all new cleared and noncleared derivatives that reference the definitions include the fallbacks the protocol enabled market participants to incorporate the revisions into their legacy noncleared derivatives trades with other counterparties that choose to adhere to the protocol the protocol was open for adherence beginning october and became effective on the same date as the supplement january the arrc supports the isda protocol on november libors administrator the ice benchmark administration iba in coordination with uk and us regulators announced the ibas intention to cease publication of the oneweek and twomonth us dollar usd libor settings immediately following the libor publication on december and the remaining usd libor settings immediately following the libor publication on june banks are encouraged to cease entering new contracts that use usd libor as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by december the company created a crossfunctional team to manage the communication of the companys transition plans with both internal and external stakeholders and to ensure that the company appropriately updates its business processes analytical tools information systems and contract language to minimize disruption during and after the libor transition however due to the uncertainty surrounding the future of libor the transition is anticipated to span several reporting periods through the end of and potentially into with newly released timing of libor cessation since the volume of our products that are indexed to libor is significant the transition if not sufficiently planned for and managed by our crossfunctional teams could adversely affect the companys financial condition and results of operations although implementation of the sofr benchmark is intended to have minimal economic effect on the parties to a liborbased contract the transition from libor to a new benchmark rate could result in significant increased systems compliance and legal costs inconsistent approaches to a transition from libor to an alternative rate among different market participants and for different financial products may cause market disruption and operational problems which could adversely affect us including by exposing us to increased basis risk and resulting costs in connection with remediating these problems and by creating the possibility of disagreements with counterparties this transition may also result in our customers challenging the determination of their interest payments or entering into fewer transactions or postponing their financing needs which could reduce the companys revenue and adversely impact our business in addition the uncertainty regarding the future of libor as well as the transition from libor to another benchmark rate or rates could have adverse impacts on floatingrate obligations loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments that currently use libor as a benchmark rate and ultimately adversely affect the companys results of operations and financial condition the monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the us its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and also affect the return earned on those loans and investments both of which in turn affect our net interest margin they can also materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold federal reserve policies may also adversely affect borrowers potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or could adversely create asset bubbles which result from prolonged periods of accommodative policy this in turn may result in volatile markets and rapidly declining collateral values changes in federal reserve policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict consequently the impact of these changes on our business and results of operations is difficult to predict the company is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the companys foreign currency translation exposure relates primarily to its china subsidiary that has its functional currency denominated in chinese renminbi rmb in addition as the company continues to expand its businesses in china and hong kong certain transactions are conducted in currencies other than the usd although the company has entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of the foreign exchange fluctuations given the volatility of exchange rates there is no assurance that the company will be able to effectively manage foreign currency translation risk fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material unfavorable impact on the companys net income therefore adversely affecting the companys business results of operations and financial condition risks related to our capital resources and liquidity as a regulated entity we are subject to capital requirements and a failure to meet these standards could adversely affect our financial condition the company and the bank are subject to certain capital and liquidity rules including the basel iii capital rules which establish the minimum capital adequacy requirements and may require us to increase our regulatory capital or liquidity targets increase regulatory capital ratios or change how we calculate regulatory capital we may be required to increase our capital levels even in the absence of actual adverse economic conditions or forecasts and enhance capital planning based on hypothetical future adverse economic scenarios as of december we met the requirements of the basel iii capital rules including the capital conservation buffer compliance with these capital requirements may limit capitalintensive operations and increase operational costs and we may be limited or prohibited from distributing dividends or repurchasing our stock this could adversely affect our ability to expand or maintain present business levels which may adversely affect our businesses results of operations and financial condition additional information on the regulatory capital requirements applicable to the company and the bank is set forth in item business supervision and regulation capital requirements in this positions for which the final determination of tax is uncertain and our income tax expense could be increased if a federal state or local authority were to assess additional taxes that have not been provided for in our consolidated financial statements there can be no assurance that we will achieve our anticipated effective tax rate the cares act included a number of tax relief provisions for eligible individuals and businesses it is possible that the us government could further introduce new tax legislation or amend current tax laws that would adversely affect the company in addition the presidents proposed budget negotiations with congress over the details of the budget and the terms of the approved budget could create uncertainty about the us economy ultimately having an adverse effect on our business the companys investments in certain taxadvantaged projects may not generate returns as anticipated and may have an adverse impact on the companys results of operations the company invests in certain taxadvantaged investments that support qualified affordable housing projects community development and renewable energy resources the companys investments in these projects are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits and other tax benefits over specified time periods due diligence review is performed both prior to the initial investment and on an ongoing basis however there may be assessments that we failed or were unable to discover or identify in the course of performing due diligence review the company is subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level may fail to meet certain government compliance requirements and may not be able to be realized the possible inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits may have a negative impact on the companys financial results the risk of not being able to realize the tax credits and other tax benefits depends on many factors outside the companys control including changes in the applicable tax code and the ability of the projects to be completed general risk factors antitakeover provisions could negatively impact the companys stockholders provisions of delaware and california law and of the companys certificate of incorporation as amended and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the company or could have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of the company for example the companys certificate of incorporation requires the approval of the holders of at least twothirds of the outstanding shares of voting stock to approve certain business combinations the company is also subject to section of the delaware general corporation law which would make it more difficult for another party to acquire the company without the approval of the board of directors additionally the companys certificate of incorporation as amended authorizes the board of directors to issue preferred stock which could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal further prior approval of the federal reserve and the dfpi is required for any person to acquire control of us and control for these purposes may be presumed to exist when a person owns or more of our outstanding common stock federal reserve approval is also required for a bank holding company to acquire more than of our outstanding common stock these and other provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of the stockholders managing reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers investors and employees threats to the companys reputation can come from many sources including unethical practices employee misconduct failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality compliance deficiencies and questionable or fraudulent activities of the companys customers the company has policies and procedures in place to protect its reputation and promote ethical conduct but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective negative publicity regarding the companys businesses employees or customers with or without merit may result in the loss of customers investors and employees costly litigation a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation the price of the companys common stock may be volatile or may decline the price of the companys common stock may fluctuate in response to a number of factors some of which are outside the companys control these factors include among other things actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in the companys results of operations and financial condition changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts and rating agencies speculation in the press or investment community strategic actions by the company or its competitors such as acquisitions or restructurings actions by institutional stockholders addition or departure of key personnel fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of the companys competitors general market conditions and in particular developments related to market conditions in the financial services industry proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments cyclical fluctuations trading volume of the companys common stock and anticipated or pending investigations proceedings or litigation that involve or affect the company industry factors general economic and political conditions and events such as cyber or terrorist attacks economic downturn or recessions interest rate changes credit default trends currency fluctuations changes to trade policies or public health issues could also cause our stock price to decline regardless of our operating results a significant decline in the companys stock price could result in substantial losses for stockholders if the companys goodwill was determined to be impaired it would result in a charge against earnings and thus a reduction in stockholders equity the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if necessary a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a material change in interest rates a significant adverse change in the business climate slower growth rates or a significant or sustained decline in the price of the companys common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of goodwill if the company determines that a future writedown of goodwill is necessary the amount of such impairment charge could be significant and could adversely affect earnings as well as capital
