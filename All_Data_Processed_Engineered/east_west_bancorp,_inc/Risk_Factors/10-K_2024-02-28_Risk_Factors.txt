the delaware general corporation law which would make it more difficult for another party to acquire us without the approval of the board of directors additionally our certificate of incorporation as amended authorizes the board of directors to issue preferred stock which could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal additionally prior approval of the federal reserve and the dfpi is required for any person to acquire control of us and control for these purposes may be presumed to exist when a person owns or more of our outstanding common stock federal reserve
