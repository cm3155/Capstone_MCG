item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management market risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument these changes may be the result of various factors including interest rates foreign exchange prices commodity prices or equity prices financial instruments that are subject to market risk can be classified either as held for trading or held for purposes other than trading the company is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates of its assets held for purposes other than trading the following discussion of interest rate risk however combines instruments held for trading and instruments held for purposes other than trading because the instruments held for trading represent such a small portion of the companys portfolio that the interest rate risk associated with them is immaterial interest rate risk in the banking industry a major risk exposure is changing interest rates to minimize the effect of interest rate changes to net interest income and exposure levels to economic losses the company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management within guidelines established by its asset liability committee alco and approved by the board the alco is responsible for approving and ensuring compliance with assetliability management policies including interest rate exposure the companys primary method for measuring and analyzing consolidated interest rate risk is the net interest income simulation analysis the company also uses a net portfolio value model to measure market value risk under various rate change scenarios and a gap analysis to measure maturity and repricing relationships between interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities at specific points in time on a limited basis the company uses hedges such as swaps rate floors and futures contracts to manage interest rate risk on certain loans trading securities trust preferred securities and deposits see further information in note derivatives and hedging activities in the notes to the companys consolidated financial statements overall the company attempts to manage interest rate risk by positioning the balance sheet to maximize net interest income while maintaining an acceptable level of interest rate and credit risk remaining mindful of the relationship among profitability liquidity interest rate risk and credit risk net interest income modeling the companys primary interest rate risk tool the net interest income simulation analysis measures interest rate risk and the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and net interest margin this analysis incorporates all of the companys assets and liabilities together with assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment through these simulations management estimates the impact on net interest income of a basis point upward or a basis point downward gradual change eg ramp and immediate change eg shock of market interest rates over a two year period in ramp scenarios rates change gradually for a one year period and remain constant in year two in shock scenarios rates change immediately and the change is sustained for the remainder of the two year scenario horizon assumptions are made to project rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis management outlook and repricing strategies asset prepayments and other market risks are developed from industry estimates of prepayment speeds and other market changes the results of these simulations can be significantly influenced by assumptions utilized and management evaluates the sensitivity of the simulation results on a regular basis table shows the net interest income percentage increase or decrease over the next twelve and twentyfour month periods as of december and based on hypothetical changes in interest rates and a

december basis points percentage change percentage change percentage change percentage change static na na table end the company is positioned slightly asset sensitive to changes in interest rates in the next year net interest income is predicted to increase in all upward rate ramp and shock scenarios in down rate scenarios income is predicted to decrease in all scenarios the increase in net interest income in rising rate scenarios is due to the projections of yields on earning assets increasing more than the cost of paying liabilities in year two net interest income is predicted to rise in all increasing rate scenarios and decrease in falling rate scenarios the companys ability to price deposits in a rising rate environment consistent with our history is a key assumption in these scenarios repricing mismatch analysis the company also evaluates its interest rate sensitivity position in an attempt to maintain a balance between the amount of interestbearing assets and interestbearing liabilities which are expected to mature or reprice at any point in time while a traditional repricing mismatch analysis gap analysis provides a snapshot of interest rate risk it does not take into consideration that assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics may not in fact reprice at the same time or the same degree also it does not necessarily predict the impact of changes in general levels of interest rates on net interest income table is a static gap analysis which presents the companys assets and liabilities based on their repricing or maturity

futures contracts with both the trading account and futures contracts marked to market daily this account had a balance of million as of december compared to million as of december the company is

rate risk associated with them is immaterial other market risk the company has minimal foreign currency risk as a result of foreign exchange contracts see note commitments contingencies and guarantees in the notes to the consolidated financial statements credit risk management credit risk represents the risk that a customer or counterparty may not perform in accordance with contractual terms the company utilizes a centralized credit administration function which provides information on the banks risk levels delinquencies an internal risk grading system and overall credit exposure loan requests are centrally reviewed to ensure the consistent application of the loan policy and standards in addition the company has an internal loan review staff that operates independently of the bank this review team performs periodic examinations of the b anks loans for credit quality documentation and loan administration the respective regulatory authority of the bank also reviews loan portfolios a primary indicator of credit quality and risk management is the level of nonperforming loans nonperforming loans include both nonaccrual loans and restructured loans on nonaccrual the companys nonperforming loans increased million to million at december compared to december this increase was primarily driven by one credit for million in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio and one credit for million in the specialty lending loan portfolio which were placed on nonaccrual during there was an immaterial amount of interest recognized on nonperforming loans during and the company had million and million of other real estate owned as of december and respectively loans past due more than days and still accruing interest totaled million as of december compared to million as of december a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when payments are past due days or more andor when management has considerable doubt about the borrowers ability to repay on the terms originally contracted the accrual of interest is discontinued and recorded thereafter only when actually received in cash certain loans are restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal due to deterioration in the financial condition of the respective borrowers the company had million of restructured loans at december and million at december those loans modified as part of the companys response to the covid19 pandemic are not considered to be restructured loans and are discussed further below in table table loan quality in thousands table start december nonaccrual

the company has taken two primary approaches in assisting our customers by modifying terms of existing loans and loans under the ppp the company has taken a proactive approach to assisting its borrowers through individual evaluation and broadbased programs modifications granted to borrowers have been payment deferrals taking the form of either full payment deferral or interestonly payments based on the circumstances of the borrower payments have been deferred either days with the option to extend or days consistent with the interagency statement on loan modifications and reporting for financial institutions working with customers affected by the coronavirus modifications granted to borrowers that are related to covid19 are not required to be evaluated as tdrs under asc these modified loans are classified as performing and are not considered past due loans are to be placed on nonaccrual when it becomes apparent that payment of interest or recovery of all principal is questionable and the covid19 related modification is no longer considered shortterm or the modification is deemed ineffective as of december three modified loans were on nonaccrual totaling thousand the company anticipates additional loans may be modified due to the effects of covid19 in the coming periods any loans modified are segmented separately with specific prepayment and maturity assumptions within the companys acl as of december the company had covid related modifications remaining on loans with a total balance of million within the companys noncredit card loan portfolios over loan modifications were made since the covid19 pandemic began of these loan modifications approximately of loans have resumed making principal or interest payments as of december there have been no chargeoffs on modified loans see further discussion of the impacts of covid19 on the companys consolidated financial statements in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition

commercial real estate consumer real estate consumer credit cards leases and other heldtomaturity securities total table end liquidity risk liquidity represents the companys ability to meet financial commitments through the maturity and sale of existing assets or availability of additional funds the company believes that the most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of a large stable supply of core deposits and wholesale funds ultimately the company believes public confidence is generated through profitable operations sound credit quality and a strong capital position the primary source of liquidity for the company is regularly scheduled payments on and maturity of assets which include billion of highquality securities available for sale the liquidity of the company and the bank is also enhanced by its activity in the federal funds market and by its core deposits additionally management believes it can raise debt or equity capital on favorable terms in the future should the need arise another factor affecting liquidity is the amount of deposits and customer repurchase agreements that have pledging requirements all customer repurchase agreements require collateral in the form of a security the us government other public entities and certain trust depositors require the company to pledge securities if their deposit balances are greater than the fdicinsured deposit limitations these pledging requirements affect liquidity risk in that the related security cannot otherwise be disposed due to the pledging restriction at december billion or of the securities availableforsale were pledged or used as collateral compared to billion or at december of these amounts securities with a market value of million at december and million at december were pledged at the federal reserve discount window but were unencumbered as of those dates the company also has other commercial commitments that may impact liquidity these commitments include unused commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit the total amount of these commercial commitments at december was billion since many of these commitments expire without being drawn upon the total amount of these commercial commitments does not necessarily represent the future cash requirements of the company the companys cash requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders debt service operating expenses and treasury stock purchases management fees and dividends received from bank and nonbank subsidiaries traditionally have been sufficient to satisfy these requirements and are expected to be sufficient in the future the bank is subject to various rules regarding payment of dividends to the company for the most part the bank can pay dividends at least equal to its current years earnings without seeking prior regulatory approval the company also uses cash to inject capital into the bank and its nonbank subsidiaries to maintain adequate capital as well as to fund strategic initiatives in september the company issued million in aggregate subordinated notes due in september the company received million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses and used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes including among other uses contributing tier capital into the bank the subordinated notes were issued with a fixedtofixed rate of and an effective rate of due to issuance costs with an interest rate reset date of september to enhance general working capital needs the company has a revolving line of credit with wells fargo bank na which allows the company to borrow up to million for general working capital purposes the interest rate applied to borrowed balances will be at the companys option either above libor or below the prime rate on the date of an advance the company pays a unused commitment fee for unused portions of the line of credit the company had no advances outstanding at december the company is a member bank of the fhlb the company owns million of fhlb stock and has access to additional liquidity and funding sources through fhlb advances the company has access to borrow up to billion through advances at the fhlb of des moines but had no outstanding fhlb des moines advances as of december operational risk operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the companys operations including those operations performed
