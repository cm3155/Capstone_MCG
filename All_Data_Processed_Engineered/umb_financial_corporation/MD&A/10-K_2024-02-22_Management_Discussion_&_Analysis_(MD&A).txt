estimates managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the companys consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to customers and suppliers allowance for credit losses bad debts investments financing operations longlived assets taxes other contingencies and litigation management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which have formed the basis for making such judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources under different assumptions or conditions actual results may differ from the recorded estimates management believes that the companys critical accounting policies and estimates are those relating to the allowance for credit losses allowance for credit losses the companys acl represents managements judgment of the total expected losses included in the companys assets held at amortized cost the companys process for recording the acl is based on the evaluation of the companys lifetime historical loss experience managements understanding of the credit quality inherent in the loan portfolio and the impact of the current economic environment coupled with reasonable and supportable economic forecasts a mathematical calculation of an estimate is made to assist in determining the adequacy and reasonableness of managements recorded acl to develop the estimate the company follows the guidelines in asc topic financial instruments credit losses the estimate reserves for assets held at amortized cost which include the companys loan and heldtomaturity security portfolios the estimation process involves the consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the specific segmentation of loans these factors have been established over decades of financial institution experience and include economic observation and loan loss characteristics this process is designed to produce a lifetime estimate of the losses at a reporting date that is based on evaluation of historical loss experience current economic conditions reasonable and supportable forecasts and the qualitative framework outlined by the office of the comptroller of the currency in the published interagency policy statement this process allows management to take a holistic view of the recorded acl reserve and ensure that all significant and pertinent information is considered in its estimate the company considers a variety of factors to ensure the safety and soundness of its estimate including a strong internal control framework extensive methodology documentation credit underwriting standards which encompass the companys desired risk profile model validation and ratio analysis if the companys total acl estimate as determined in accordance with the approved acl methodology is either outside a reasonable range based on review of economic indicators or by comparison of historical ratio analysis the acl estimate is an outlier and management will investigate the underlying reasons based on that investigation issues or factors that previously had not been considered may be identified in the estimation process which may warrant adjustments to estimated credit losses the ending result of this process is a recorded consolidated acl that represents managements best estimate of the total expected losses included in the loan and heldtomaturity security portfolios considering available information from internal and external sources relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument while management utilizes its best judgment and information available the ultimate adequacy of the acl is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the companys control including the performance of its portfolios the economy and changes in interest rates as such significant downturns in circumstances relating to loan quality and economic conditions could result in a requirement for additional allowance likewise an upturn in loan quality and improved economic conditions may allow a reduction in the required allowance in either instance unanticipated changes could have a significant impact on the companys provision for credit losses and acl reported in its consolidated income statements and consolidated balance sheets respectively
