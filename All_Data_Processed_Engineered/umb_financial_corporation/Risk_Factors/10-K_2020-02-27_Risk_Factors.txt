item risk factors financialservices companies routinely encounter and address risks and uncertainties in the following paragraphs the company describes some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect its business results of operations financial condition including capital and liquidity or prospects or the value of or return on an investment in the company these risks and uncertainties however are not the only ones faced by the company other risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to the company that it has failed to identify or that it currently considers immaterial may adversely affect the company as well except where otherwise noted the risk factors address risks and uncertainties that may affect the company as well as its subsidiaries these risk factors should be read in conjunction with managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which can be found in part ii item of this report beginning on page and the notes to the consolidated financial statements which can be found in part ii item of this report beginning on page the levels of or changes in interest rates could affect the companys business or performance the companys business results of operations and financial condition are highly dependent on net interest income which is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings net interest income is significantly affected by market interest rates which in turn are influenced by monetary and fiscal policies general economic conditions the regulatory environment competitive pressures and expectations about future changes in interest rates the policies and regulations of the federal government in general and the frb in particular have a substantial impact on market interest rates see government monetary and fiscal policies in part i item of this report beginning on page which is incorporated by reference herein additionally the company has a significant number of loans derivative contracts borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on the london interbank offered rate libor in the uk financial conduct authority announced that libor is to be transitioned to alternative rates during the next four years us regulatory authorities have voiced similar support for phasing out libor the transition from libor could create considerable costs and additional risk since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing libor although we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from libor will be failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the company may be adversely affected by policies regulations or events that have the effect of altering the difference between longterm and shortterm interest rates commonly known as the yield curve depressing the interest rates associated with its earning assets to levels near the rates associated with its interest expense or changing the spreads among different interestrate indices in addition a rapid change in interest rates could result in interest expense increasing faster than interest income because of differences in the maturities of the companys assets and liabilities further if laws impacting taxation and interest rates materially change or if new laws are enacted certain of the companys services and products including municipal bonds may be subject to less favorable tax treatment or otherwise adversely impacted the level of and changes in market interest ratesand as a result these risks and uncertaintiesare beyond the companys control the dynamics among these risks and uncertainties are also challenging to assess and manage for example while the highly accommodative monetary policy currently adopted by the frb may benefit the company to some degree by spurring economic activity among its customers such a policy may ultimately cause the company more harm by inhibiting its ability to grow or sustain net interest income the companys customers and counterparties also may be negatively impacted by the levels of or changes in interest rates which could increase the risk of delinquency or default on obligations to the company the levels of or changes in interest rates moreover may have an adverse effect on the value of the companys investment portfolio which includes longterm municipal bonds with fixed interest rates and other financial instruments the return on or demand for loans the prepayment speed of loans including without limitation the pace of paydowns expected or forecasted for commercial real estate and construction loans the cost or availability of deposits or other funding sources or the purchase or sale of investment securities see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate risk in part ii item of this report beginning on page for a discussion of how the company monitors and manages interestrate risk weak or deteriorating economic conditions more liberal origination or underwriting standards or financial or systemic shocks could increase the companys credit risk and adversely affect its lending or other banking businesses and the value of its loans or investment securities the companys business and results of operations depend significantly on general economic conditions when those conditions are weak or deteriorating in any of the markets or regions where the company operates its business or performance could be adversely affected the companys lending and other banking businesses in particular are susceptible to weak or deteriorating economic conditions which could result in reduced loan demand or utilization rates and at the same time increased delinquencies or defaults these kinds of conditions also could dampen the demand for products and other services in the companys investmentmanagement assetservicing insurance brokerage or related businesses increased delinquencies or defaults could result as well from the company adoptingfor strategic competitive or other reasonsmore liberal origination or underwriting standards for extensions of credit or other dealings with its customers or counterparties if delinquencies or defaults on the companys loans or investment securities increase their value and the income derived from them could be adversely affected and the company could incur administrative and other costs in seeking a recovery on its claims and any collateral weak or deteriorating economic conditions also may negatively impact the market value and liquidity of the companys investment securities and the company may be required to record additional impairment charges if investment securities suffer a decline in value that is determined to be otherthantemporary in addition t o the extent that loan chargeoffs exceed estimates an increase to the amount of provision expense related to the allowance for loan losses would reduce the companys income see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskcredit risk management in part ii item of this report beginning on page for a discussion of how the company monitors and manages credit risk a financial or systemic shock and a failure of a significant counterparty or a significant group of counterparties could negatively impact the company possibly to a severe degree due to its role as a financial intermediary and the interconnectedness of the financial system a meaningful part of the companys loan portfolio is secured by real estate and as a result could be negatively impacted by deteriorating or volatile realestate markets or associated environmental liabilities at december percent of the companys aggregate loan portfoliocomprised of commercial realestate loans representing percent of the aggregate loan portfolio residential realestate loans representing percent of the aggregate loan portfolio and construction realestate loans representing percent of the aggregate loan portfoliowas primarily secured by interests in real estate located in the states where the company operates other credit extended by the company may be secured in part by real estate as well realestate values in the markets where this collateral is located may be different from and in some instances worse than realestate values in other markets or in the united states as a whole and may be affected by general economic conditions and a variety of other factors outside of the control of the company or its customers any deterioration or volatility in these realestate markets could result in increased delinquencies or defaults could adversely affect the value of the loans and the income to be derived from them could give rise to unreimbursed recovery costs and could reduce the demand for new or additional credit and related banking products and other services all to the detriment of the companys business and performance in addition if hazardous or toxic substances were found on any real estate that the company acquires in foreclosure or otherwise the company may incur substantial liability for compliance and remediation costs personal injury or property damage challenging business economic or market conditions could adversely affect the companys feebased banking investmentmanagement assetservicing or other businesses the companys feebased banking investmentmanagement assetservicing and other businesses are driven by wealth creation in the economy robust market activity monetary and fiscal stability and positive investor business and consumer sentiment economic downturns market disruptions high unemployment or underemployment unsustainable debt levels depressed realestate markets industry consolidations or other challenging business economic or market conditions could adversely affect these businesses and their results if the funds or other groups that are clients of umbfs were to encounter similar difficulties umbfss revenue could suffer the companys bankcard revenue is driven primarily by transaction volumes in business healthcare and consumer spending that generate interchange fees and any of these conditions could dampen those volumes other feebased banking businesses that could be adversely affected include trading asset management custody trust and cash and treasury management the companys investmentmanagement and assetservicing businesses could be negatively impacted by declines in assets under management or administration or by shifts in the mix of assets under management or administration the revenues of the companys investmentmanagement businesses are highly dependent on advisory fee income these businesses generally earn higher fees on equitybased or alternative investments and strategies and lower fees on fixed income investments and strategies advisoryfee income may be negatively impacted by an absolute decline in assets under management or by a shift in the mix of assets under management from equities or alternatives to fixed income such a decline or shift could be caused or influenced by any number of factors such as underperformance in absolute or relative terms loss of key advisers or other talent changes in investing preferences or trends market downturns or volatility drops in investor confidence reputational damage increased competition or general economic conditions any of these factors also could affect clients of umbfs and if this were to cause a decline in assets under administration at umbfs or an adverse shift in the mix of those assets the performance of umbfs could suffer to the extent that the company continues to maintain a sizeable portfolio of availableforsale investment securities its income may be adversely affected and its reported equity more volatile as of december the companys securities portfolio totaled approximately billion which represented approximately percent of its total assets regulatory restrictions and the companys investment policies generally result in the acquisition of securities with lower yields than loans for the yearended december the weighted average yield of the companys securities portfolio was percent as compared to percent for its loan portfolio accordingly to the extent that the company is unable to effectively deploy its funds to originate or acquire loans or other assets with higher yields than those of its investment securities the companys income may be negatively impacted additionally approximately billion or percent of the companys investment securities are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value unrealized gains or losses on these securities are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income which in turn affects the companys reported equity as a result to the extent that the company continues to maintain a significant portfolio of availableforsale securities its reported equity may experience greater volatility cyber incidents and other security breaches at the company at the companys service providers or counterparties or in the business community or markets may negatively impact the companys business or performance in the ordinary course of its business the company collects stores and transmits sensitive confidential or proprietary data and other information including intellectual property business information fundstransfer instructions and the personally identifiable information of its customers and employees the secure processing storage maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to the companys operations and reputation and if any of this information were mishandled misused improperly accessed lost or stolen or if the companys operations were disrupted the company could suffer significant financial business reputational regulatory or other damage for example despite security measures the companys information technology and infrastructure may be breached through cyberattacks computer viruses or malware pretext calls electronic phishing or other means these risks and uncertainties are rapidly evolving and increasing in complexity and the companys failure to effectively mitigate them could negatively impact its business and operations service providers and counterparties also present a source of risk to the company if their own security measures or other systems or infrastructure were to be breached or otherwise fail likewise a cyberattack or other security breach affecting the business community the markets or parts of them may cycle or cascade through the financial system and adversely affect the company or its service providers or counterparties many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond the companys control even when an attempted cyber incident or other security breach is successfully avoided or thwarted the company may need to expend substantial resources in doing so may be required to take actions that could adversely affect customer satisfaction or behavior and may be exposed to reputational damage if a breach were to occur moreover the company could be exposed to contractual claims regulatory actions and litigation by private plaintiffs and would additionally suffer reputational harm despite the companys efforts to safeguard the integrity of systems and controls and to manage thirdparty risk the company may not be able to anticipate or implement effective measures to prevent all security breaches or all risks to the sensitive confidential or proprietary information that it or its service providers or counterparties collect store or transmit the trading volume in the companys common stock at times may be low which could adversely affect liquidity and stock price although the companys common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq global select market the trading volume in the stock may at times be low and in relative terms less than that of other financialservices companies a public trading market that is deep liquid and orderly depends on the presence in the marketplace of a large number of willing buyers and sellers and narrow bidask spreads these market features in turn depend on a number of factors such as the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which the company has no control during any period of lower trading volume in the companys common stock the stock price could be more volatile and the liquidity of the stock could suffer the company operates in a highly regulated industry and its business or performance could be adversely affected by the legal regulatory and supervisory frameworks applicable to it changes in those frameworks and other legal and regulatory risks and uncertainties the company is subject to expansive legal and regulatory frameworks in the united statesat the federal state and local levelsand in the foreign jurisdictions where its business segments operate in addition the company is subject to the direct supervision of government authorities charged with overseeing the taxation of domestic companies and the kinds of financial activities conducted by the company in its business segments these legal regulatory and supervisory frameworks are often designed to protect public or private interests that differ from the interests of the companys shareholders or nondeposit creditors see government monetary and fiscal policies and regulation and supervision in part i item of this report beginning on page which is incorporated by reference herein we believe that government scrutiny of all financialservices companies has increased fundamental changes have been made to the banking securities and other laws that govern financial services with the doddfrank act and basel iii being two of the more prominent examples and a host of related business practices have been reexamined and reshaped as a result the company expects to continue devoting increased time and resources to risk management compliance and regulatory change management risks also exist that government authorities could judge the companys business or other practices as unsafe unsound or otherwise unadvisable and bring formal or informal corrective or enforcement actions against it including fines or other penalties and directives to change its products or other services for practical or other reasons the company may not be able to effectively defend itself against these actions and they in turn could give rise to litigation by private plaintiffs further if the laws rules and regulations materially adversely affect the company including any changes that would negatively impact the tax treatment of the company the companys products and services or the companys shareholders the company may be adversely impacted all of these and other regulatory risks and uncertainties could adversely affect the companys reputation business results of operations financial condition or prospects regulatory or supervisory requirements future growth operating results or strategic plans may prompt the company to raise additional capital but that capital may not be available at all or on favorable terms and if raised may be dilutive the company is subject to safetyandsoundness and capitaladequacy standards under applicable law and to the direct supervision of government authorities see regulation and supervision in part i item of this report beginning on page if the company is not or is at risk of not satisfying these standards or applicable supervisory requirementswhether due to inadequate operating results that erode capital future growth that outpaces the accumulation of capital through earnings or otherwisethe company may be required to raise capital restrict dividends or limit originations of certain types of commercial and mortgage loans if the company is required to limit originations of certain types of commercial and mortgage loans it would thereby reduce the amount of credit available to borrowers and limit opportunities to earn interest income from the loan portfolio the company also may be compelled to raise capital if regulatory or supervisory requirements change in addition the company may elect to raise capital for strategic reasons even when it is not required to do so the companys ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all will depend on general economic and market conditions which are outside of its control and on the companys operating and financial performance accordingly the company cannot be assured of its ability to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms an inability to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms could damage the performance and value of its business prompt regulatory intervention and harm its reputation and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period of time its viability as a going concern could be threatened if the company is able to raise capital and does so by issuing common stock or convertible securities the ownership interest of our existing stock holders could be diluted and the market price of our common s tock could decline the market price of the companys common stock could be adversely impacted by banking antitrust or corporate laws that have or are perceived as having an antitakeover effect banking and antitrust laws including associated regulatoryapproval requirements impose significant restrictions on the acquisition of direct or indirect control over any bank holding company including the company acquisition of ten percent or more of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company or depository institution including shares of our common stock generally creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer controls the bank holding company or depository institution also a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before among other things acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than percent of the voting shares of any bank including our bank in addition a nonnegotiated acquisition of control over the company may be inhibited by provisions of the companys restated articles of incorporation and bylaws that have been adopted in conformance with applicable corporate law such as the ability to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights terms conditions and privileges of such preferred stock without stockholder approval if any of these restrictions were to operate or be perceived as operating to hinder or deter a potential acquirer for the company the market price of the companys common stock could suffer the companys business relies on systems employees service providers and counterparties and failures or errors by any of them or other operational risks could adversely affect the company the company engages in a variety of businesses in diverse markets and relies on systems employees service providers and counterparties to properly oversee administer and process a high volume of transactions this gives rise to meaningful operational riskincluding the risk of fraud by employees or outside parties unauthorized access to its premises or systems errors in processing failures of technology breaches of internal controls or compliance safeguards inadequate integration of acquisitions human error and breakdowns in business continuity plans significant financial business reputational regulatory or other harm could come to the company as a result of these or related risks and uncertainties for example the company could be negatively impacted if financial accounting dataprocessing or other systems were to fail or not fully perform their functions the company also could be adversely affected if key personnel or a significant number of employees were to become unavailable due to a pandemic natural disaster war act of terrorism accident or other reason these same risks arise as well in connection with the systems and employees of the service providers and counterparties on whom the company depends as well as their own thirdparty service providers and counterparties see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskoperational risk in part ii item of this report beginning on page for a discussion of how the company monitors and manages operational risk the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us financial services institutions are interrelated because of trading clearing counterparty and other relationships we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks payment processors and other institutional clients which may result in payment obligations to us or to our clients due to products we have arranged many of these transactions expose us to credit and market risk that may cause our counterparty or client to default in addition we are exposed to market risk when the collateral we hold cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the secured obligation any losses arising from such occurrences could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition the company is heavily reliant on technology and a failure or delay in effectively implementing technology initiatives or anticipating future technology needs or demands could adversely affect the companys business or performance like most financialservices companies the company significantly depends on technology to deliver its products and other services and to otherwise conduct business to remain technologically competitive and operationally efficient the company invests in system upgrades new solutions an d other technology initiatives including for both internally and externally hosted solutions many of these initiatives have a significant duration are tied to critical systems and require substantial internal and external resources although the company takes steps to mitigate the risks and uncertainties associated with these initiatives there is no guarantee that they will be implemented on time within budget or without negative operational or customer impact the company also may not succeed in anticipating its future technology needs the technology demands of its customers or the competitive landscape for technology in addition the company relies upon the expertise and support of service providers to help implement maintain andor service certain of its core technology solutions if the company cannot effectively manage these service providers the service parties fail to materially perform or the company w as to falter in any of the other noted areas its business or performance could be negatively impacted negative publicity outside of the companys control or its failure to successfully manage issues arising from its conduct or in connection with the financialservices industry generally could damage the companys reputation and adversely affect its business or performance the performance and value of the companys business could be negatively impacted by any reputational harm that it may suffer this harm could arise from negative publicity outside of its control or its failure to adequately address issues arising from its conduct or in connection with the financialservices industry generally risks to the companys reputation could arise in any number of contextsfor example cyber incidents and other security breaches mergers and acquisitions lending or investmentmanagement practices actual or potential conflicts of interest failures to prevent money laundering corporate governance and unethical behavior and practices committed by competitors in the financial services industry the company faces intense competition from other financialservices and financialservices technology companies and competitive pressures could adversely affect the companys business or performance the company faces intense competition in each of its business segments and in all of its markets and geographic regions and the company expects competitive pressures to intensify in the futureespecially in light of recent legislative and regulatory initiatives technological innovations that alter the barriers to entry current economic and market conditions and government monetary and fiscal policies competition with financialservices technology companies or technology companies partnering with financialservices companies may be particularly intense due to among other things differing regulatory environments see competition in part i item of this report beginning on page competitive pressures may drive the company to take actions that the company might otherwise eschew such as lowering the interest rates or fees on loans or raising the interest rates on deposits in order to keep or attract highquality customers these pressures also may accelerate actions that the company might otherwise elect to defer such as substantial investments in technology or infrastructure the company has certain businesses that utilize wholesale models which can lead to customer concentrations for those businesses that if negatively impacted by new entrants competitive pressures or consolidations could affect the companys fee income whatever the reason actions that the company takes in response to competition may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition these consequences could be exacerbated if the company is not successful in introducing new products and other services achieving market acceptance of its products and other services developing and maintaining a strong customer base or prudently managing expenses the companys riskmanagement and compliance programs or functions may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss the company maintains an enterprise riskmanagement program that is designed to identify quantify monitor report and control the risks that it faces these include interestrate risk credit risk liquidity risk market risk operational risk reputational risk and compliance risk the company also maintains a compliance program to identify measure assess and report on its adherence to applicable law policies and procedures while the company assesses and improves these programs on an ongoing basis there can be no assurance that its frameworks or models for risk management compliance and related controls will effectively mitigate risk and limit losses in its business if conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in the companys riskmanagement or compliance programs or if its controls break down the performance and value of the companys business could be adversely affected the company could be negatively impacted as well if despite adequate programs being in place its riskmanagement or compliance personnel are ineffective in executing them and mitigating risk and loss liquidity is essential to the company and it s business or performance could be adversely affected by constraints in or increased costs for funding the company defines liquidity as the ability to fund increases in assets and meet obligations as they come due all without incurring unacceptable losses banks are especially vulnerable to liquidity risk because of their role in the maturity transformation of demand or shortterm deposits into longerterm loans or other extensions of credit the company like other financialservices companies relies to a significant extent on external sources of funding such as deposits and borrowings for the liquidity needed to conduct its business a number of factors beyond the companys control however could have a detrimental impact on the availability or cost of that funding and thus on its liquidity these factors include market disruptions changes in its credit ratings or the sentiment of its investors the state of the regulatory environment and monetary and fiscal policies declines in the value of its investment securities the loss of substantial deposit s or customer relationships financial or systemic shocks significant counterparty failures and reputational damage unexpected declines or limits on the dividends declared and paid by the companys subsidiaries also could adversely affect its liquidity position while the companys policies and controls are designed to ensure that it maintains adequate liquidity to conduct its business in the ordinary course even in a stressed environment there can be no assurance that its liquidity position will never become compromised in such an event the company may be required to sell assets at a loss in order to continue its operations this could damage the performance and value of its business prompt regulatory intervention and harm its reputation and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period of time its viability as a going concern could be threatened see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskliquidity risk in part ii item of this report beginning on page for a discussion of how the company monitors and manages liquidity risk if the companys subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments or distributions to the company it may be unable to satisfy its obligations to counterparties or creditors or make dividend payments to its stockholders the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its bank and nonbank subsidiaries and depends on dividend payments and distributions from those subsidiaries to fund its obligations to counterparties and creditors and its dividend payments to stockholders see regulation and supervisionrequirements affecting the relationships among the company its subsidiaries and other affiliates in part i item of this report beginning on page any of the companys subsidiaries however may be unable to make dividend payments or distributions to the company including as a result of a deterioration in the subsidiarys performance investments in the subsidiarys own future growth or regulatory or supervisory requirements if any subsidiary were unable to remain viable as a going concern moreover the companys right to participate in a distribution of assets would be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors including in the case of the bank its depositors and the fdic an inability to attract retain or motivate qualified employees could adversely affect the companys business or performance skilled employees are the companys most important resource and competition for talented people is intense even though compensation is among the companys highest expenses it may not be able to locate and hire the best people keep them with the company or properly motivate them to perform at a high level recent scrutiny of compensation practices especially in the financialservices industry has made this only more difficult in addition some parts of the companys business are particularly dependent on key personnel including investment management asset servicing and commercial lending if the company were to lose and find itself unable to replace these personnel or other skilled employees or if the competition for talent drove its compensation costs to unsustainable levels the companys business results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted the company is subject to a variety of litigation and other proceedings which could adversely affect its business or performance the company is involved from time to time in a variety of judicial alternativedispute and other proceedings arising out of its business or operations the company establishes reserves for claims when appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles but costs often can be incurred in connection with a matter before any reserve has been created the company also maintains insurance policies to mitigate the cost of litigation and other proceedings but these policies have deductibles limits and exclusions that may diminish their value or efficacy despite the companys efforts to appropriately reserve for claims and insure its business and operations the actual costs associated with resolving a claim may be substantially higher than amounts reserved or covered substantial legal claims even if not meritorious could have a detrimental impact on the companys business results of operations and financial condition and could cause reputational harm changes in accounting standards could impact the companys financial statements and reported earnings accounting standardsetting bodies such as the financial accounting standards board periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that affect the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements these changes are beyond the companys control and could have a meaningful impact on its consolidated financial statements the companys selection of accounting methods assumptions and estimates could impact its financial statements and reported earnings to comply with generally accepted accounting principles management must sometimes exercise judgment in selecting determining and applying accounting methods assumptions and estimates this can arise for example in the determin ation of the allowance for loan losses or the determination of the fair value of assets or liabilities furthermore accounting methods assumptions and estimates are part of acquisition purchase accounting and the calculation of the fair value of assets and liabilities that have been purchased including creditimpaired loans the judgments required of management can involve difficult subjective or complex matters with a high degree of uncertainty and several different judgments could be reasonable under the circumstances and yet result in significantly different results being reported see critical accounting policies and estimates in part ii item of this report beginning on page if managements judgments are later determined to have been inaccurate the company may experience unexpected losses that could be substantial the companys ability to successfully make opportunistic mergers and acquisitions is subject to significant risks including the risk that government authorities will not provide the requisite approvals the risk that integrating acquisitions may be more difficult costly or time consuming than expected and the risk that the value of acquisitions may be less than anticipated the company may make opportunistic acquisitions of other financialservices companies or businesses from time to time these acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain that approval in a timely manner or at all even when the company is able to obtain regulatory approval the failure of other closing conditions to be satisfied or waived could delay the completion of an acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring altogether any failure or delay in closing an acquisition could adversely affect the companys reputation business results of operations financial condition or prospects additionally acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties including lowerthanexpected performance or higherthanexpected costs difficulties related to integration diversion of managements attention from other business activities changes in relationships with customers or counterparties and the potential loss of key employees an acquisition also could be dilutive to the companys current stockholders if preferred stock common stock or securities convertible into preferred stock or common stock were issued to fully or partially pay or fund the purchase price the company moreover may not be successful in identifying acquisition candidates integrating acquired companies or businesses or realizing the expected value from acquisitions there is significant competition for valuable acquisition targets and the company may not be able to acquire other companies or businesses on attractive terms or at all there can be no assurance that the company will pursue future acquisitions and the companys ability to grow and successfully compete in its markets and regions may be impaired if it chooses not to pursue or is unable to successfully complete acquisitions we face risks in connection with our strategic undertakings and new business initiatives we are engaged and may in the future engage in strategic activities including acquisitions joint ventures partnerships investments or other business growth initiatives or undertakings there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify appropriate opportunities that we will be able to negotiate or finance such activities or that such activities if undertaken will be successful we are focused on our longterm growth and have undertaken various strategic activities and business initiatives some of which may involve activities that are new to us for example in the future we may engage in or focus on new lines of business financial technologies and other activities that are outside of our current product offerings these new initiatives may subject us to among other risks increased business reputational and operational risk as well as more complex legal regulatory and compliance costs and risks our ability to execute strategic activities and new business initiatives successfully will depend on a variety of factors these factors likely will vary based on the nature of the activity but may include our success in integrating an acquired company or a new internallydeveloped growth initiative into our business operations services products personnel and systems operating effectively with any partner with whom we elect to do business meeting applicable regulatory requirements and obtaining applicable regulatory licenses or other approvals hiring or retaining key employees achieving anticipated synergies meeting managements expectations actually realizing the anticipated benefits of the activities and overall general market conditions our ability to address these matters successfully cannot be assured in addition our strategic efforts may divert resources or managements attention from ongoing business operations and may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and potential liability if we do not successfully execute a strategic undertaking it could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations reputation or growth prospects
