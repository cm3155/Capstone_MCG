item ri sk factors on april the company announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with htlf under which the company will acquire htlf in an allstock transaction the merger the following represents a material change in the companys risk factors from those disclosed in part i item of the annual report on fees and other regulatory fees printing costs and other related costs we have begun collecting information in order to formulate detailed integration plans to deliver anticipated cost savings additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our business with the business of htlf and there are many factors beyond our or htlfs control that could affect the total amount or timing of integration costs although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may offset incremental transaction and mergerrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all whether or not the merger is consummated we htlf and the combined company will incur substantial expenses in pursuing the merger and may adversely impact our and the combined companys earnings completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement will be conditioned upon customary closing conditions including the receipt of required governmental authorizations consents orders and approvals including approval by certain federal banking regulators we and htlf intend to pursue all required approvals in accordance with the merger agreement however there can be no assurance that such approvals will be obtained without additional cost on the anticipated timeframe or at all regulatory approvals for the merger may not be received may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not currently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the merger before the proposed merger and the bank merger may be completed various approvals consents and nonobjections must be obtained from regulatory authorities in determining whether to grant these approvals regulatory authorities consider a variety of factors including the regulatory standing of each party these approvals could be delayed or not obtained at all including due to any or all of the following an adverse development in any partys regulatory standing or any other factors considered by regulators in granting such approvals governmental political or community group inquiries investigations or opposition changes in legislation or the political environment including as a result of changes of the us executive administration or congressional leadership and regulatory agency leadership even if the approvals are granted they may impose terms and conditions limitations obligations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined companys business or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement there can be no assurance that regulators will not impose any such conditions limitations obligations or restrictions or that such conditions limitations obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger or will otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger in addition there can be no assurance that any such conditions limitations obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger additionally the completion of the merger is conditioned on the absence of certain orders injunctions or decrees by any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction that would prohibit or make illegal the completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement despite the parties expected commitment to use their reasonable best efforts to respond to any request for information and resolve any objection that may be asserted by any governmental entity with respect to the merger agreement neither party is required under the terms of the merger agreement to take any action commit to take any action or agree to any condition or restriction in connection with obtaining these approvals that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the combined company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole after giving effect to the proposed merger measured on a scale relative to htlf and its subsidiaries taken as a whole the merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be completed such failure to complete the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement could cause our results to be adversely affected our stock price to decline or have a material and adverse effect on our stock price and results of operations if the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement including the merger are not completed for any reason including as a result of our shareholders failing to approve the issuance of the shares of our common stock constituting the merger consideration the share issuance or the amendment to our restated articles of incorporation to increase of the number of authorized shares of our common stock the articles amendment or htlf stockholders failing to approve the merger agreement there may be various adverse consequences and we andor htlf may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our respective customers and employees moreover our stock price may decline because costs related to such transactions such as legal accounting and financial advisory fees must be paid even if such transactions including the merger are not completed moreover we may be required to pay a termination fee of million to htlf upon a termination of the merger agreement in certain circumstances in addition if the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement are not completed whether because of our failure to receive required regulatory approvals in a timely fashion or because one of the parties has breached its obligations in a way that permits htlf to terminate the merger agreement or for any other reason our stock price may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed the market price for our common stock following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement may be affected by factors different from those that historically have affected or currently affect our common stock and htlf common stock subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement upon completion of the merger holders of shares of htlf common stock will receive shares of our common stock as merger consideration the combined companys business and financial position will differ from the business and financial position of the company and htlf before the completion of the merger and accordingly the results of operations of the combined company will be affected by some factors that are different from those currently affecting our results of operations and those currently affecting the results of operations of htlf accordingly the market price and performance of our common stock is likely to be different from the performance of our common stock in the absence of the merger in addition general fluctuations in stock markets could have a material adverse effect on the market for or liquidity of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance upon completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement we will be subject to the risks related to htlfs business including its commercial real estate loans upon completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement we will be subject to risks related to htlfs business and take on its loans investments and other obligations this will increase our credit risk and if such obligations are not repaid or losses are incurred on such obligations there could be material and adverse effects on our business additionally where our businesses overlap any risks we face may be increased due to the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement for example htlfs loan portfolio has a large concentration of commercial real estate loans which we will add to our existing portfolio this may exacerbate the risks we already undertake with our own portfolio comprised meaningfully of commercial real estate loans as described in our 10k under item risk factorsa meaningful part of the companys loan portfolio is secured by real estate and as a result could be negatively impacted by deteriorating or volatile real estate markets the economic environment or associated environmental liabilities and may result in new ones for example htlfs loan portfolio has a large concentration of commercial real estate loans which involve additional risks because the value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in any of the geographic bank markets in which such real estate is located as well as because funds are advanced based on estimates of costs and the estimated value of the completed project and therefore have a greater risk of default in a weaker economy construction projects require prudent underwriting including determination of a borrowers ability to complete the project while staying within budget and on time in accordance with construction plans economic events supply chain issues labor market disruptions and other factors outside the control of htlf and our control or that of the borrowers could negatively impact the future cash flow and market values of affected properties as a result of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and our acquisition of htlf we will record goodwill in connection with such acquisition and if it becomes impaired our earnings could be significantly impacted under current accounting methods goodwill is not amortized but instead is subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount in connection with our acquisition of htlf we will record goodwill in the fair value amount of such acquisition although we do not anticipate impairment charges if we conclude that some portion of such goodwill is impaired a noncash charge for the amount of such impairment would be recorded against earnings additionally htlf records a significant amount of goodwill at december htlf had goodwill of million representing approximately of its stockholders equity upon the merger we will take on htlfs goodwill and if all or some portion of that million is impaired following the acquisition we would be required to take a noncash charge for such amount against our earnings a goodwill impairment charge could be caused by a decline in our stock price or the occurrence of a triggering event that compounds negative financial results further because a large portion of htlfs portfolio is secured by commercial real estate loans if such portfolio were to be seen as less valuable in a deteriorating real estate market we may be required to record an impairment on our htlf acquisition therefore following the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement including the merger and our recording of goodwill in connection therewith if such goodwill becomes impaired our earnings could be significantly and adversely affected the future results of the combined company following the merger may suffer if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the merger the size of the business of the combined company will increase significantly beyond the current size of either our or htlfs business the combined companys future success will depend in part upon its ability to manage this expanded business which may pose challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity the combined company may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of the significant increase in the size of its business in addition htlfs bank subsidiary htlf bank is a colorado statechartered nonmember bank subject to primary federal bank regulatory oversight by the federal deposit insurance corporation while umb bank is and the bank subsidiary of the combined company upon completion of the bank merger will be a national bank subject to oversight by the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ the laws regulations and regulatory guidance applicable to htlf bank and the bank subsidiary of the combined company will therefore differ in ways that may affect the operations of the combined company additionally the internal policies of umb bank and htlf bank with regards to their investment portfolios may differ on factors such as hold limits per bond issuer life of the bond or credit risk appetite as a result there are assets on the balance sheet of htlf bank that the bank subsidiary of the combined company is not expected to hold whether based on differences in regulatory oversight or internal policies and we may dispose of such assets contemporaneous or subsequent to the closing of the merger the disposition of certain assets in a highinterest rate environment such as we have in the past experienced are currently experiencing and may experience again in the future could result in a sale of assets at a market price that is different than the estimated book value of such assets and impact regulatory capital ratios at the time of the closing of the merger further we may replace such disposed assets with loweryielding investments any of which could impact our future earnings and return on equity there can be no assurances that the combined company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings or other benefits currently anticipated from the merger we and htlf will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on us and htlf these uncertainties may impair our and htlfs ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and could cause customers and others that deal with us or htlf to seek to change existing business relationships with us or htlf in addition subject to certain exceptions we and htlf expect to agree to operate our respective businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice in all material respects prior to closing and we and htlf expect to agree not to take certain actions which could cause us or htlf to be unable to pursue other beneficial opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger litigation related to the merger could prevent or delay completion of the merger or otherwise negatively affect the business and operations of us and htlf we and htlf may incur costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any shareholder or stockholder lawsuits filed in connection with the merger such litigation could have an adverse effect on our and htlfs financial condition and results of operations and could prevent or delay the completion of the merger the merger will not be completed unless important conditions are satisfied or waived including approval of the merger agreement by htlf stockholders and approval of the share issuance and the articles amendment by our shareholders specified conditions set forth in the merger agreement must be satisfied or waived to complete the merger if the conditions are not satisfied or subject to applicable law waived the merger will not occur or will be delayed and each of htlf and us may lose some or all of the intended benefits of the merger
