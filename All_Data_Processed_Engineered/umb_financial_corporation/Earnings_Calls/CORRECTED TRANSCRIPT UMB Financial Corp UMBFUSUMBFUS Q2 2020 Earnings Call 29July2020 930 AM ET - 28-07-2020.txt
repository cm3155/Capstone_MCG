today i hope you and your families are safe and healthy as we all navigate our way through not only a global pandemic but an increasingly polarized and highly politicized environment we have been engaging our associates customers and communities through proactive outreach and dialogue inclusion and diversity have always been core principles for umb however like many others weve taken more action in this time of heightened sensitivity we offer a variety of resource groups for our associates and theyre hosting ongoing conversations to educate and dispel stereotypes as well as foster inclusion on page of the slides we concluded a few comments on our inclusion and diversity efforts along with some key topics i encourage you to read our recent corporate citizenship update by using the links shown there during the quarter we have continued to serve our customers fully while most of our workforce remains offsite weve begun seeing customers in our branches by appointment only and continue our drivethru operations at most locations our sales teams have had success with virtual calling efforts meetings with clients via video in some instances and im extremely proud and impressed with how our associates continue to adapt and perform were taking a measured approach in our return to the workplace bringing back a small percentage of our employees on a phasein basis and including enhanced safety protocols while id like to see more of our team back in the office health and safety will take a priority last quarter i shared my thoughts on the economic crisis paired with the unfortunate timing of the implementation of cecl and its likely impact on our industry as we continue to see there is a great deal of subjectivity on how banks apply the methodology making comparisons of actual risk difficult at best so we focus on what we know and our priorities continue to be maintaining the highquality underwriting standards that are served as well over the long term maintaining solid capital liquidity levels to carry us through this crisis and doing whats right to support our workforce customers and communities we entered the second half of the year in a position to manage what lies ahead we had solid capital levels and a very strong liquidity position with a loantodeposit ratio that provides us flexibility and most importantly we have an experienced credit team with a superior track record particularly in times of crisis as it relates to the us economy we are navigating through the murky waters muddled by global pandemic and deeprooted social issues where every issue is further politicized particularly in election year for these reasons the overall economy continues to be fragile and these uncertainties will likely persist into the next year however within our markets and among our borrowers we havent seen any significant signs of deterioration today umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 now ill turn to our second quarter results which highlighted the balance sheet strength i mentioned along with the quality of our underwriting practices as evidenced by our basis points of net chargeoffs days into the quarter we continue to hear that our customers generally remain prepared to weather the current economic headwinds we posted net income of million or per share on a gaap basis and million or per share on an operating basis pretax preprovision income of million represents a increase over the linked quarter and a increase compared to the second quarter of total fee income was strong at million while this included some marketrelated adjustments including coli evaluations we saw positive results in investment banking at higher trading volumes particularly in municipals and mbs drove the linked quarter increase of million which you can find in our trading and investment banking line similar to trends across the industry weve seen reductions in fees in our brokerage business as well as reduced credit and debit card spend across most categories net interest income increased from first quarter driven by lower deposit and borrowing costs along with strong loan volume which included billion in ppp loans new loan production outside of ppp remained strong at million and payouts and paydowns were slightly lower than historical averages at of balances excluding ppp organic growth was partly negated by the normalization of commercial line utilization which was at june following the spike to in the first quarter from the initial impact of covid in addition some active deals we had in the pipeline at the end of the first quarter were pushed out of it as customers pause to understand the implications of the crisis looking ahead into the third quarter we continue to see robust activity average loan balances excluding ppp increased on a linkedquarter basis annualized driven by commercial and consumer real estate our ci balances were impacted by the normalization of line utilization mortgage prequalification applications hit record highs during the quarter helping to drive an quarterly increase in consumer real estate the composition of our loan portfolio which remains diverse and wellbalanced across several product lines geographies and industries is shown on slide in the balance sheet section of the presentation followed by loan activity during the quarter and break downs of our commercial portfolios by asset class on slide weve updated our exposure to sensitive industries that we shared in april we removed transportation after reviewing its performance that group is largely comprised of freight and warehouse relationships with top industry companies and weve had little exposure to travelrelated businesses weve added senior living cre to the list based on the potential strain on occupancy levels and operating expenses related to the covid restrictions and increased pandemicrelated costs this category represents of our loan portfolio or just when risk adjusted as we did last quarter we again looked at each category for specific characteristics or specific credits that we feel comfortable with as well as those which may carry more risk if the crisis is prolonged after an indepth analysis the portion we view as potentially being more impacted represents about of total loans excluding ppp balances of course this is an indication that we expect lots of in this portfolio but we continue to keep a close eye on the conditions as they evolve weve included some details and considerations in each category on the slide details umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 on the billion in ppp loans we booked during the quarter are shown on slide the median size was and as you can see theyre broadly diversified among industries now looking at asset quality and provision you see on slide that second quarter provision under cecl was million which represents times net chargeoffs of million as we noted previously our substantial provision and reserve build in the first quarter was prudent and conservative the additional reserve build in the second quarter brings our total allowance for loan losses to million as of june with an allowanceto loan coverage of excluding ppp loans that coverage is or nearly times what it was at yearend prior to the adoption of cecl total reserves to nonperforming assets is now times compared to the peer median of times based on those who have reported todate net chargeoffs to average loans for the quarter of ph just a few basis points is better than our longterm historical performance and npls improved from the first quarter to of loans umb has always had a reputation for being responsive consistent and prudent as it relates to credit and we have a good longterm track record for keeping rank credits from moving to loss based on our relationship with our clients while this unpredictable environment is a new territory for all of us well keep our focus on risk management and believe that our credit quality will remain one of the key differentiators especially during periods of stress this quarter weve added a more granular look at loans by type in the loan risk table on slide this data shows the quality inherent in our portfolio were continuing to provide flexibility for our clients through modifications and youll see those totals in the table as well based on initial requests we approved approximately billion in modifications however many of those were ultimately not accepted as customers determined they werent fully necessary this speaks to the general strength of our customer base at june we had loan modifications of billion on our books representing of the portfolio excluding ppp balances this includes our proactive offer of sixmonth deferrals to our practice solutions clients largely dental offices in our business banking group our teams are in regular contact with our clients and have ongoing dialogue and ph clearly conversations with our cre customers indicate that a good portion will begin making payments at the end of the deferral period as we indicated last quarter a significant number of our borrowers within the sensitive industries has strong balance sheets and sponsors well ahead of the pandemic we have begun the reinvigoration of our retail business including online banking upgrades online account opening and our new teller platform we onboarded the second wave of our existing online banking users just days after we moved our branch operations to drivethru only in midmarch the usage has increased although the timing makes it difficult to fully gauge the drivers of the uptake among our customers the average number of daily online banking users increased by during the second quarter and the number of users enrolled in our personal finance tool and the new platform increased from march to june mobile deposit capture has increased since customer access to branches was limited and finally since our online account opening capabilities fully launched in may about of our new dda accounts have been opened through the digital channel ultimately its clear that a mix of options is important to our customer base and well continue to make sure our network has the appropriate capabilities we continually look at staffing and the use of technology as we transform our digital offering especially in light of the headwinds were living through umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 in closing i reiterate what i said at the beginning were in a sound position to navigate what lies ahead we continue to manage for the long term with a strong capital and liquidity position a history of prudent risk management and diverse revenue sources to help provide buffers in the interest rate environment were living in now ill turn it over to ram to discuss some of the drivers of our results ram ram shankar chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thank you mariner ill begin with comments on cecl and the drivers of our allowance for credit losses which begin on slide as we previously discussed we took a conservative approach to our first quarter modeling considering the volatility and frequent changes in economic expectations we saw at that time as mariner noted our second quarter provision for credit losses totaled million down from million in the linked quarter approximately half of the provisioning in the second quarter reflected changes in key macroeconomic variables as prescribed in the moodys baseline economic forecast issued in june as well as consideration for modified loans future provisioning levels will continue to be predicated on loan growth any changes in our portfolio mix net chargeoffs and forwardlooking macroeconomic assumptions that drive our econometric models at june nearly of our allowance from credit losses was attributed to our commercial and commercial real estate portfolios now looking at the quarterly results net interest income of million represents an increase of million from the first quarter benefiting from a basis points reduction in the cost of interestbearing liabilities and loan volumes including ppp loans these were offset by the adverse impact of basis point quarteroverquarter decrease in the one month libor rate total earning asset yields fell basis points to from the linked quarter driven by a basis point decline in loan yields net interest spread increased basis point over the first quarter and was down only basis points from the yearago period net interest margin compressed by basis points from the first quarter drivers of the change included a basis point reduction from loan yields which included a negative basis points to margin from ppp loans and positive basis points from the synthetic floor we have in place a basis points reduction from excess liquidity and the reduced benefit of free funds negative basis points from lower reinvestment rates and market changes in the afs portfolio partially offset by a positive basis points impact from lower interestbearing liability costs including a basis points reduction in the cost of interestbearing deposits to as stated fee income was million for the quarter and reflected continued impacts from the volatile market including a valuation adjustment in companyowned life insurance income which resulted in a million swing from the last quarter which is included in the other income line this increase is offset by a similar increase in deferred compensation expense as mariner mentioned increased muni and mbs volumes drove solid increases in our investment banking income supplemented by market valuation benefits from our trading portfolio offsets included a million reduction of brokerage fees and a million reduction in bankcard income weve been watching as peers have reported results and its clear that the pandemic had dramatically impacted credit and debit card spending patterns our card purchase volume stats are on slide on a yearoveryear basis we saw a decline in total card volumes driven largely by reduced healthcare spending as people have umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 delayed some routine medical and dental care as well as decreases in travel gasoline restaurants and entertainment spending on the commercial front corporate travel and entertainment have been curtailed and municipalities which make up a good portion of our card business have seen declines related to school closings and reduction in other usual activities expenses for the quarter increased or million compared to the first quarter driven by a million increase in deferred compensation expense the offset to the increased coli income i mentioned in the salaries and benefits line this increase was partially offset by lower payroll taxes and profit sharing and 401k expense marketing expense decreased million compared to the first quarter from the decline in travel and business development activities due to the pandemic additionally we recorded million in nonrecurring costs tied to our covid19 response for the full year we anticipate the tax rate will be approximately to moving back to the balance sheet average deposits increased on a linked quarter basis and free funds now comprise nearly of total deposits we estimate that about million of demand deposit balances at june were related to ppp funds disbursed to our customers we continue to maintain strong regulatory capital ratios with the cet1 ratio of based on the adoption of interagency guidance for regulatory capital transition and tangible common equity to assets of our tangible book value per share increased to at the end of the quarter up from a year ago for comparison our peers that have reported so far have shown an increase of regulatory capital ratios are shown on slide that concludes our prepared remarks and ill turn it now back over to the operator to begin the qa portion of the call question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from gordon mcguire from stephens please go ahead gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc good morning mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning gordon ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp hi gordon gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 i wanted to start on the balance sheet size even excluding the ppp deposits deposits grew billion quarter overquarter im curious what trends youre seeing so far in july in terms of deposit balances and how much of that youd expect to be fairly sticky or whether youre seeing any kind of outflows mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp this is mariner we dont obviously give guidance but i would say that the environment that were in doesnt look to be over any time soon and liquidity build seems to be a part of the environment were living in so we dont expect liquidity drawdowns anytime soon we have a very very diverse book of deposits and i would say during the last crisis when we had a safety and soundness liquidity build it stuck around largely and we continue to build our balance sheet its too early i would say to determine whats going to happen but if history is an indicator weve largely picked up market share rather than just temporary liquidity it will be a combination but i think its too early really to tell but the first part of your question is what are we seeing i would just say that were still in the environment and people are still building liquidity gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc okay and i think the last quarter you had suggested that you would try to put more cash on hand into the securities portfolio is that still consistent looking forward from here mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well i mean obviously we want to rotate strategically wed like to rotate more of that into loans and so its just a matter of what were seeing with demand in the absence of loan demand well be rotating that liquidity into securities gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc and just on deposit cost repricing was pretty strong this quarter ram im curious if you had an estimate to what kind of floor you could expect for cost or how much more room you have to go on that front mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp go ahead ram ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah so i mean were at basis points for the second quarter in the month of june we are about basis points right so if you look at the last time we were at to basis points on the short end of the curve our deposit cost bottomed ph out at around basis points or so of course thats three four years ago and there have been some slight shift in our deposit mix so theres still some room probably on the downside for deposit pricing based on some of the aggressive actions were taking but its going to be marginal relative to the basis points drop you saw in deposit cost this past quarter gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 got it and then last thing for me if i look at the sensitive industry update and compare each portfolio to what was listed last quarter it looks like the potentially more impacted subset increased on a dollar basis and percent basis i think particularly in multifamily but also some of the other categories im curious what drove that whether its migration from less concern three months ago to more concern now and if so what trends or characteristics would have warranted more concern mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp ill take the high level and then ram can see if he if i dont pick up the whole answer for you i mean first of all the portfolio is slightly smaller right so you have a percentage change related to the size of the balance sheet so thats a part of it and then the other one was really just a shift as we spoke we took transportation out and put in senior housing so thats the overall change really there i would say if you in my estimation if you take the balance sheet size component of that its really a margin in the air kind of concept its pretty much the same size i would describe it as unmoved ram i dont know if you want to ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp no thats exactly it as you see in our footnote on slide right so we took away transportation as an atrisk category and then instead this time around because of occupancy trends and what you see in the headlines about senior living we added that and that differential is just about basis points so thats why you see it marginally pick up mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah and i just want to i also want to echo that sort of our view of this concept is a little bit different than its being interpreted we dont think that this group as identified means we see loss in it its a group of categories that were watching more closely it doesnt indicate loss so thats also something id add to the description gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc okay and i appreciate the switch from transportation to senior living but i guess i was looking at multifamily went from million potentially more impacted in dollar balances to million and i was curious if there was any increased concern out of some of these portfolios mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp tom do you want to take that its really a minor shift thomas s terry a executive vice president chief credit officer umb financial corp yeah this is tom terry some of that is just the growth in construction loans we still have construction loans that are advancing so you are seeing an increase in balances there has not been a shift in identification of oh we have more that were worried about i think its just the natural growth that were seeing mainly in our construction loans umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 gordon mcguire q analyst stephens inc okay thank you i appreciate it mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks gordon operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty of kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great good morning everybody mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc mariner in your prepared remarks i think you characterized that the outlook for loan growth or loan demand as robust which is a little bit more optimistic than some of your peers im interested what youre seeing in your markets that lead to that statement and any color you could have on loan repricing would be great mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah sure so on loan growth first of all even in the second quarter where you see a small decrease that obviously was mostly due to line utilization coming down if you look at gross production it was actually up so even in the second quarter we saw that the gross side of it coming the way we expected it to which is negated by utilization rates which by the way we see as an indication of quality thats a positive sign of quality in the portfolio as it relates to growth and looking into the next quarter as we always do we give a little bit of a look into the coming quarter and part of why we werent any higher in the second quarter is because of coronavirus there was a little bit of i call it hesitation or slowdown in the ability to close and bring parties together and such so some of second quarter has pushed into third quarter some of the growth we expected and some of the loans we identified have pushed into the third quarter so that will be part of what we see in the third quarter and forward is that and as far as the loan growth itself what weve always said about our loan growth is its more about market share gains in underpenetrated markets than it is economic activity so when we say we see robust loan growth its not umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 an indication of economic activity its more us blocking and tackling and continuing to take market share where we have low market share in large markets so its more about share gains than it is economic activity christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc appreciate it thank you for that maybe a followup the ability to finetune branches has been emerging theme i think with covid you guys have in the past been pretty proactive in terms of managing your branches im interested in kind of how youre thinking about expenses and expense management in this environment and maybe what youve learned over the last days that could lead to some synergies over time thanks mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah well i mean id start by saying were in the middle of that so what id say is there is absolutely change coming right and we mentioned in our prepared comments some of the changes related to pickup in activity in all of our different mobile platforms and products so were seeing it i would say what once was going to be a year process is now a 2year process i think the next two years will be pretty dramatic on the uptake in digital acceptance of products and interface with the industry with our customer base its too early to tell exactly what were going to do with that i mean were deep into it were neck deep in analyzing what it means and how were going to react and whether its the size of a branch whats going to take place in a branch will we do appointment only in the branch side and do transactions in the drive up all these questions that are in process but be assured it will change it will become more efficient absolutely christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thats great and maybe last one for ram can you help us with the ppp outlook the amount of fees that are to come in and maybe the timing of how youre modeling it thanks ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah that remains to be seen right chris so what were modeling is very consistent what others have said somewhere between and paying off in the fourth and first quarters thats probably the earliest that we expect a big grudge of these forgiveness things to happen so probably i would say distributed evenly between the fourth and the first quarters i would start with to range christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then the amount of the fees that are yet to be realized do you indiscernible ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah its about 240ish based on the median that we disclosed our median size on the ppp is about for modeling purposes were using about on these balances christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 okay thank you very much operator operator instructions our next question comes from nathan race of piper jaffray please go ahead nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co hi guys good morning mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hi nathan ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp hey nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co wanted to just touch on the loan modifications as disclosed in the slide deck just curious as you guys are talking to clients at this point how much of those of loans that are deferred currently are expected to need a second deferral going forward mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp tom you want to take that thomas s terry a executive vice president chief credit officer umb financial corp yeah at this point we feel like the volume of requests for a second deferral so far has been very low in our commercial real estate book its been roughly of those on deferral who have requested a second deferral in the ci portfolio its been less than that certainly all of that is subject to the pausing of the economy and kind of what lays ahead over the next several weeks and months so that could change but right now were hearing very positive commentary from our customers and the level of requests has really slowed nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then indiscernible mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp and also what we have that because that information as you know the note so from first quarter when we talked about percentage of deferrals those were approved and what was accepted at this point is substantially less is that billion tom versus indiscernible umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 thomas s terry a executive vice president chief credit officer umb financial corp billion was approved and ultimately billion is what got booked so we had a lot of clients that were approved for a modification that ultimately said i dont need it and kept on paying for the contract mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah so the second number that were announcing today is more important than the first number which is the first number is just what we approved at the end of the last quarter nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co understood mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it and then just thinking about the provision in the quarter appreciate the details in the slide deck along those lines i guess the qualitative effect on the provision score is a little below what we saw from some others so far in the quarter and it looks like you guys use a third party input from early june so just and i think that input includes no second wave of covid going forward which i think varies by state at this point so just curious if we had a more kind of current economic input into the provision and cecl model how that would have impacted your provision in the quarter and kind of how you guys think about provisioning at least into the third quarter as well at this point thomas s terry a executive vice president chief credit officer umb financial corp ill take the high level there and ram you can get in to any modeling question that we want to get into there but id first im going to get my soapbox here for just a quick second you know cecl if you all are trying to look for actual performance or relative try to look through the fog to figure out what credit risks actually exist in the banks im not a believer in cecl as it relates to what it actually tells us were complying with cecl because its an accounting convention we need to comply with but it means nothing to me as it relates to how i feel about the quality of my loan portfolio and what we pay attention to is what is happening to our npls whats happening to our chargeoffs whats happening to our past dues whats happening to utilization rates and those are the things that you can actually look at across all banks to level the information cecl is a joke because the way every bank does it its different so its a stupid way to analyze what the problems are in a banks portfolio so thats how i feel about that so for me what you should look at is what is our npl coverage to allowance for us its times against our peer group at times which helps understand why were at ph on coverage with the provision versus the peer group being a median at ph theyre covering their umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 npls at times were covering our npls at times so those are the kinds of things i think are more important to focus on and you know whats happening to your chargeoff rate whats happening to your your utilization rates ph also down significantly which means the performance of our ci book is actually stronger than it was and then in your past dues whats happened in your past dues those are current period forecasting outlook things to look at that are real and tangible versus trying to forecast the impact of covid on unemployment and the impact the shortterm impact of and unemployment that happens overnight on a shortterm basis because of the disease or a virus and what that impacts would be on the economy nine quarters from now its an obscene and absurd way to think about credit quality so thats how i think about that but so stepping back into that were using moodys and were using ph bbb corporate spreads and the data that we deploy is right in line with moodys and right in line with bbb corporate spreads and thats the information that was spit out gave you the macro piece of our provision for the quarter which is i think about what million for the quarter ph a minor effect we are on that our total provision is million ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp indiscernible yeah thomas s terry a executive vice president chief credit officer umb financial corp million yeah if you look at page on the slide deck its million and thats all spit out from the model and using our data that we would update the model using our data for our portfolio to update those macro effects to do the qualitative side indiscernible thats my take you didnt ask for all that but im kind of frustrated by having to be compared to other banks covid macroeconomic nonsense thats all over the board and its just silly because it doesnt have anything to do it anyway so thats my take on it operator our next question comes from jared shaw of wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning this is actually timur braziler filling in for jared mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hey timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi guys appreciate all the color on cecl thats certainly helpful but maybe switching over to the commercial loan book have those utilization rate stabilized and in your commentary for a robust loan growth in the third quarter is any of that coming from the commercial base mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 can you ask that again ive timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc so looking at the utilization rates in the commercial book have those started to stabilize at the and then as you look at the robust loan growth commentary for the third quarter is any of that being driven by the commercial book mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp so the utilization rate is its hard to tell what it will be on a prospective basis because that will be based on things that will have to unfold but this would be more in line with our historic utilization rates where we are now so thats its sort of in line with a backward looking utilization rate as far as what how it will play into loan growth in the next quarter given the fact that its kind of stabilized the historic levels its less likely to be a drag but probably not going to play much in the way of what kind of growth we have timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay understood and then one more for me looking at the deferrals can we have the break out of those deferred for days versus six months mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp you got that i guess tom we have that down on the slide there thomas s terry a executive vice president chief credit officer umb financial corp yeah the so on page slide the business banking category those are all done on sixmonth deferrals the vast majority of everything else was done on a 90day interestonly basis timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and so i guess for the business banking clients as the deferral period is going on how much visibility are you getting into that subsegment is there an offset gives you kind of cautious optimism coming out of this or is this going to be more of a situation then until that deferral period end thats going to be really hard to gauge what the outcome is mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp go ahead tom thomas s terry a executive vice president chief credit officer umb financial corp yeah the majority of that business banking segment are practice finance loans largely to dentists and so you can really track quite early with when the dental offices open back up and theyre allowed to do more electivetype umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 procedures which they are today then were optimistic that at the end of the deferral period they should be able to get back to a normal payment structure the unknown clearly is if we fall back into a lockdown of some sort that changes but you kind of follow the dentist and for the first and close to days of this they were shut down entirely except for emergencytype procedures so were optimistic that as the economy slowly opens back up and the dental practices continue to be able to do the electivetype procedures that theyll be able to come off the deferral at the end of the agreement timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks timur operator operator instructions our next question comes from chris mcgratty of kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for the followup i just wanted to get a little bit more color on the trajectory of service charges weve heard from most banks that the elevated cash and liquidity is obviously in lower transactions are just weighing on that but interested in kind of that progression over the course of april may june mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp youve got that ram or jim james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp well this is jim rine on the service charges we saw an uptick in the first quarter related to onetime event but were seeing primarily the same thing but most are as part of service charges actually on the decline but theyre consistent with earnings credit more cash on balance sheet so that particular line item certainly is going to see some pressure but its not through loss of business or other market actions that are causing that other than increased offset christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i understood mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp so relatively stable at this point with some sort of industry pressure based on just trends right but theres nothing underneath the hood on it umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and maybe just one quick one on the hotel portfolio could you maybe comment on occupancy rates in your portfolio in kind of where those need to be for kind of breakeven for some of your borrowers mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well its i mean the first answer is its just under and we mostly have limited service as you know within the portfolio as far as breakeven im not sure thats something you know tom was that something we have for indiscernible thomas s terry a executive vice president chief credit officer umb financial corp its not off top we dont mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah i dont have that we thats something maybe we can address later but its about just under occupied in portfolio we feel relatively good i mean its certainly something that were watching closely but again its a guaranteed portfolio with large liquid sponsors and its the limited service hotels so i dont have all the other loaded expenses to deal with et cetera the limited service tend to outperform or tending to outperform the other categories and again feeling pretty good about about where we are there and maybe we can address in the future quarters the breakeven im sure its obviously different from hotel to hotel christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thank you i appreciate that and then just a quick one on the deferral process for hotels some banks are kind of were requiring more equity to get that deferral how did the deferral process work specifically for your hotel borrowers thomas s terry a executive vice president chief credit officer umb financial corp yeah ill take that you have to also start out on the basis that the hotel deals that we have done started out at lower loan to cost lower loan to value generally with strong sponsors so we just we didnt require across the board additional equity in some cases we did but as a rule we just would go ahead and do the deferral but again were going into these i think in a stronger position than perhaps some of our brethren christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you thomas s terry a executive vice president chief credit officer umb financial corp was that what youre asking okay umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah exactly thank you operator our next question comes from david long of raymond james please go ahead david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hi dave david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc hey just wanted to ask about the asset servicing business in this volatile backdrop my sense is that those revenue numbers from that business can move around quite a bit you guys have held pretty consistent there so just curious on the puts and takes in that business and then also does the environment today lend itself to pick up any market share in that business as well mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp go ahead jim james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp yeah mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hey go ahead yeah james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp that business has been strong for us partly because weve continued to acquire market share weve made investments we have two strong teams as far as our utah and milwaukie and so the alternative investment is indiscernible weve seen stable growth there i dont have anything umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2020 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp to add mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i think the only thing i would add is that because we are a strong player in the alternative space the asset values hold up better than the alternative side than they do in the liquid market side if they dont reprice the same way so they hold better than ph how we used to hold better and we have also seen new business so combination of continued new business along with a heavier reliance on ph alt with less volatility and the way the assets are priced has been helpful and lastly you asked about market share gains because of the industry we have seen the pipeline grow because of the consolidation and what weve learned from talking to our teams is that when the consolidation takes place the pipeline goes into suspense basically and so anything that has been in the pipeline within other larger consolidation basically becomes more alive for us and so our pipeline has been growing because of the consolidation so those are the kind of the three combinations along with our custody business has been weve hired some people added some of the big players so were starting to see some strength on just pure institutional custody side largely again the fallout from the consolidation we picked up several really key people to help just build the custody institutional custody side of the loan david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc okay got it thats the color i was looking for i
