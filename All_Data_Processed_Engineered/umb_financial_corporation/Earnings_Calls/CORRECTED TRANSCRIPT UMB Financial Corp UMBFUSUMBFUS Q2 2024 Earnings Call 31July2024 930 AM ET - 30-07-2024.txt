chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp thank you kay and good morning everyone thanks for joining us as we discuss our great second quarter results announced yesterday afternoon our strong first quarter performance continued into the second quarter with net interest income growth driven by a growing balance sheet and net interest margin expansion along with solid credit metrics we reported gaap earnings of million or per share driven by continued momentum across our various lines of business on an operating basis we earned million or per share balance sheet growth included a linkedquarter annualized increase in average loan balances led by commercial real estate and construction draws on previously approved loans additionally average card balances increased assisted by the full quarter impact of our cobrand card portfolio we acquired in march top line loan production was million for the quarter payoffs and paydowns which are difficult to predict were of balances this is a slight increase from prior quarter but in line with our historic averages credit quality in our loan portfolio remains excellent net chargeoffs were again just basis points of average loans for the quarter and nonperforming loans fell to a meager basis points of total loans over the past eight quarters our nonperforming ratio has averaged basis points compared to basis points for our peer group and basis points for the industry as a whole credit cards drove the small amount of charge offs we saw in the quarter while we had a net recovery in both ci and specialty lending in fact ci has posted net recoveries in four of the last five quarters asset quality has been very strong in our investment real estate portfolio since we charged off less than million cumulatively which can be attributed to just three loans provision of million reflects the continued loan growth along with the impact of a recalibration of our models our coverage ratio increased basis points to of total loans average total deposits grew million or on a linkedquarter annualized basis including the intentional reduction of brokered cd balances and the expected seasonal decline in public funds for comparison peers reported a median annualized increase of just for the second quarter deposit growth in the quarter highlights our strong diversified funding profile with growth coming from nearly all lines of business on the consumer front weve had good success from private banking and retail money market promotions with targeted marketing investments made in the first half of the year excluding brokered cds average client deposits increased approximately billion from the last quarter in fact since the turmoil of last spring our deposits excluding brokered cds have increased by billion or over the second quarter of ram will share a more detailed look at these and other quarterly drivers shortly finally we remain excited about our pending acquisition of heartland financial and have shared a few updates in the deck while its early in the process weve outlined milestones and progress in the integration planning our focus is to ensure a seamless transition without disrupting businessasusual activities the establishment of an integration team allows our customerfacing associates to remain focused on serving the customer and generating growth again we believe this transaction will accelerate umbs growth strategy further diversifying umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 and derisking our business model the addition of this highquality franchise is a great fit from a strategic financial and cultural perspectives and we look forward to capitalizing on the many opportunities we see at the combined company in and beyond now ill turn it over to ram ram shankar chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks mariner net interest income of million represented an increase of million or reflecting continued loan growth and higher levels of liquidity net interest margin increased basis points on a linked quarter basis to outpacing the expectations i shared previously in large part due to strongerthan expected dda balances the increase was driven by the positive impact of basis points from loan repricing and mix basis points from the securities portfolio basis point from the level of free funds and basis points related to various smaller items these were partially offset by a basis point reduction from higher deposit pricing driven by mix changes cycletodate betas on total deposits and on loan yields are and respectively and continued to track closely to our expectations for terminal betas looking into the third quarter with the prospect of a fed rate cut in september we would expect our net interest margin to be relatively stable to secondquarter levels approximately of our total deposits are hard indexed to shortterm interest rates as the fed funds rate changes these deposits reprice down immediately an additional of our total deposits or what we call soft indexed or balances negotiated at current prevailing market rates on these softindexed deposits we would expect to move deposit rates down pretty quickly following any rate cuts overall we expect our deposit betas on the way down to be immediate and steeper than peer banks similar to our experience during this past tightening cycle coupled with favorable reinvestment of cash flows from the securities book and repricing of some loans at accretive yield our interest rate simulation results shown on page of our deck show us benefiting from interest rate cuts in year with fairly neutral implications for year as a reminder this analysis does not include any interest income generated from new growth or the heartland acquisition at this preliminary stage we estimate that our pro forma interest rate position will remain relatively neutral details and activity in our securities portfolio are shown on slides and in our deck the combined afs and htm portfolios averaged billion during the quarter a decrease of we continue to purchase mortgagebacked securities and agencies while as noted security levels fluctuate based on our collateral needs for both public funds and trust deposits the average purchased yield on our portfolio was for the quarter while securities rolling off at a yield of we expect billion of securities with a yield of to roll off over the next months capital levels continued to build with our common equity tier capital increasing to and continued growth in tangible book value which increased by from march to tangible book value per share has grown over the past year as previously described in our forward purchase agreement our regulatory capital ratios do not include the million forward equity offering agreement that we announced in april turning back to the income statement noninterest income was million a linkedquarter reduction of largely due to a few nonrecurring items in the prior quarter these first quarter benefits included million in net gains on equity positions a million legal settlement and a million in gains on the sale of land momentum in our fee businesses continued with fund services assets under administration growing to billion an increase of from june in private wealth our teams have brought in million in net umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 new assets yeartodate ahead of fullyear levels and credit and debit card spending including from our newly acquired retail cobrand portfolio reached billion in the second quarter up from billion a year ago noninterest expense of million for the quarter included pretax acquisition expenses of million and a reduction of million in previously accrued fdic special assessment charges on an operating basis non interest expense increased million linkedquarter and included higher processing fees related to higher software subscription costs and various software projects along with increased bankcard expense within salaries and benefits expense typical seasonal reductions in fica and 401k costs along with a decrease in deferred compensation expense was partially offset by increased bonus and salary expense related to the timing of merit increases and higher bonus accruals for yeartodate performance excluding the onetime items and seasonal variances our core expense run rate in the second quarter was approximately million finally our effective tax rate was for the quarter compared to in the second quarter of the yearoveryear increase was primarily related to lower income on taxexempt securities and a decrease in tax benefit from stock compensation for the full year we would expect the tax rate between and now ill turn it over to the operator for the qa portion of the call question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions we will pause here briefly as questions are registered our first question comes from the line of jared shaw with barclays jared your line is now open jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc morning so maybe just to start on the pending acquisition and any potential restructuring or changes we should expect heading into closing and sort of thinking around a level of brokered deposits given your good loanto deposit ratio any securities restructurings that you anticipate either umbf or heartland doing this as we as we go into closing any change that we should be thinking about mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp ill let ram take that i mean obviously we cant give you much in the way of guidance there but ram can give us some color umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah ill point out to what we did in the most recent quarter our brokered cds and fhlb advances on one of our pages in our investor deck we have the rolling maturities on page of remaining fhlb brokered and the btfp program so other than carefully evaluating them when they come up for renewal our intermediate buyers based on our loantodeposit ratio and our liquidity levels is probably less than runoffs so thats on our side we dont expect any assetside restructuring on the investment portfolio on our book so no specific guidance on what heartland might do but for us other than paying down this excess liquidity that we have theres nothing that were contemplating jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay and then as we look at that potential runoff there should we just assume that were the cash drifts slower the securities maybe you just use the cash flow from that to reduce ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yes generally we expect the portfolio the bond portfolio to be relatively stable but yeah the excess cash might come down just because again given our loantodeposit ratio in the mid we could let it let these deposits go and obviously as you see on page these are some of our higher cost deposits or borrowings as well jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc yeah yeah okay and then on the ddas i know obviously each quarter you have some flex or some fluctuations with endofperiod balances any color you can give on sort of trajectory or expectation on dda whether its endofperiod or average as we go through the rest of the year mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp it is probably not much different than the comments weve made in the past which is that we feel like were at the bottom of the rotation cycle we cant predict that really more than give you backwardlooking feelings and at the end of the day the way that we come up with feeling that were close to the bottom of that rotation is the fact that its pretty clear that rates arent going up from here so and we feel like with our book most of the rotation took place and took place early in the cycle as we talked about from the beginning of the cycle that we would go through it first so on a relative basis against our peers we believe were probably through with most of that rotation as long as rates look to be going where we all believe them to be going ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp and i would ignore the endofperiod dda balances like i saw always say right its theres a lot of volatility at quarterend monthend depending on clients and verified activities so i would not index yourself too much to endofperiod balances mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 though it does help us make our money right i mean that is a mushroom kind of the quarter we make money on that as it happens typically at the end of almost every month it seems jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay so you think we could be at a point where we start seeing growth in average or so continue to see growth from this quarter in average ddas mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp i mean we thats its hard to predict i would say that thats just hard to predict whether its going to grow or not thats based on sales activities and our ability to bring in new business which we dont forecast publicly jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay all right thanks and then just finally for me on asset quality asset quality is great i was just wondering what happened within criticized and classified in the quarter and then you referenced the model change for cecl is that just using a different sort of moodys baseline or what i guess what drove the model change there mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp so tom will take the first question well turn the second part of that over to ram thomas s terry a chief credit officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah our criticized and classified loans are basically flat quarteroverquarter we always have a little bit of movement between our lowpass watch which actually was down and thats a pass part of our watchlist but the criticize was flat ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah and on the second question about cecl we did not change our baseline assumptions were still indexed to moodys baseline from time to time we look at our cecl models for performance for effectiveness and change and swap out macroeconomic variables drivers correlations so as part of that we tweaked a couple of our models just to get a higher provision get to a basis points coverage ratio mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp i mean all in all on that front we just take a conservative approach we feel like its the right its the kind of organization we are and we believe in a conservative strong healthy reserve ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 and the important part of both your questions underlying questions is the provision excess provision was not because of underlying portfolio trends it was all quantitatively driven based on changes to cecl models that we have and loan growth mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp and i would just say just to echo what tom said related to those things our books really never looked better we talked about criticized being flat its also meager basis points i mean it hardly exists and then the chargeoffs are what they are were we feel very good about how we manage the company as the same team doing the same thing for a long time we take it very seriously and were real proud of it jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc great thanks for all that color ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks jared operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw chris your line is now open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning ram maybe mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc coming back to the margin how are you just coming back to the margin for a second you guys are heartlands margin looks roughly as of last quarter about basis points higher with the bond restructuring from them and the accretion i mean you should be im trying to get a sense of like pro forma margins so any comment there would be helpful given youve talked about relative neutrality on the nim thomas s terry a chief credit officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah thats a tough question for me to answer just sitting here i mean as you know right it really depends on what the portfolio marks on the acquisition date whenever that has happened right so theres going to be a lot of noise related to how that accretes into income so i mean you could do a simple math based on taking their whatever margin and our margin on our earning assets and get to a number but theres going to be a lot more noise because of purchase accounting adjustment so its really hard for us to sit here obviously theyre still running their book and it really depends on what happens to deposit betas and how we manage it umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 after close so i feel like its too early to kind of give you a pro forma look at margin other than the comments that i said that relatively we should be neutral from an interest rate position on a pro forma basis mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp i mean longer term its one of the reasons were doing the transaction right i mean they do have a better margin tied to having a smaller business book of loans which carries a higher yield they have a more granular deposit base so i mean its the combination of where they run their business longer term taking the accounting noise of the marks and all that its part of the reason were doing the transaction so longer term we expect that christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay in terms of just broader efficiency meaning the objective that youve accomplished over the years is operating leverage if i think about the bank youve been running kind of low low it would feel given the given that momentum mid would seem once you get everything in accreted and integrated that would be reasonable but is there anything were missing in terms of investments now that youre through i think the last quarter you talked about the investments youre making to go through but any other guidance as we look out over the next couple of years mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp i mean i think we remain as im probably not going to give you what youre looking for here but we remain as focused on being efficient as we have been theres always more work to do i think the combination of our two companies will make us that much stronger i would say again just overall it is more operating leverage than efficiency so i think the room for us the opportunity for us is to focus more on revenue than it is expense reduction weve done a lot of that efficiency work to make our systems modernized weve said in the comments before that weve pushed a big bowling ball through at the front end of the pandemic we pushed a big bowling ball through the python right to get our systems up and ready and modernized and we are more focused today on spend thats focused on customer experience so more than of our spend is focused there so that should benefit both revenue and retention of client and all of that but in general i would say i think our opportunities on the revenue front and were good at that and i think the exciting thing about the heartland transaction is well be able to take their great small business platform and layer our institutional and our ci on top of their branch networks and their footprints and as youre aware the way weve modeled all that there are no revenue synergies in what we produce publicly so thats all upside and gravy and yet to be seen so were very excited about that and again ill just reecho that if you think about operating leverage our opportunity is more on the revenue side than its expense christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great and then if i could just one more ram on the deposit costs quarteronquarter change any particular i heard your prepared remarks about the indexed deposits but any particular product that drove the increase i know theres been some questions from some of the larger banks about sweep deposits but any impact from that or any one category youd call out on the driving of costs umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah no the increase in costs on a quarteroverquarter basis is the pipeline of institutional deposits that weve talked about for the last couple of quarters so the timing of those jim coming on board was the driver of the deposit costs and ill let jim answer on the sweep side but yeah james d rine a president chief executive officer umb bank na investment management well on the sweep side i think youre referring on the healthcare portion and for us we dont anticipate that being an issue were not a fiduciary as you know those deposit transaction accounts for healthcarerelated expenses we dont anticipate that being anything material for us going forward christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc perfect thank you james d rine a president chief executive officer umb bank na investment management and it wasnt the driver in the second quarter either so no future impact no card impact yeah christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of nathan race with piper sandler nathan your line is now open nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah hi guys good morning thanks for taking the questions james d rine a president chief executive officer umb bank na investment management good morning nate mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp hey nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co i was curious just to get an update in terms of what youre seeing across the loan pipeline and just kind of overall loan growth expectations over the next couple quarters im just curious based on the pipeline mix do you expect that to be largely driven by commercial real estate as we saw here in umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp ill take that nate thanks for if you look back were the comments we made in the first quarter the same we would make in the second quarter as to what where that cre balances were coming from largely they were from existing commitments that were being drawn on we do continue to book business in cre multifamily and industrial so there are there remain lots of opportunities there so as weve talked before its less than it was because were more focused on great current relationships that we can broaden our relationships with and deposits and other business with so thats the case kind of transitionally coming out of the pandemic where theres all that excess liquidity in the system but as far as the pipeline goes we actually see a very strong third quarter and as you know we usually only give outlook into the next days as we do that its a very strong third quarter and its coming from across the board all of our segments nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great very helpful and then just going back to rams margin guidance i think for the back half of the year just kind of stable even if we get a cut at the end of september just trying to understand that maybe how conservative that guidance is just given that you seem pretty well matched up in terms of your hard and soft indexed deposits relative to your true floating rate loans in terms of those percentages and just as you kind of continue to grow loans at pretty strong ph bps and use some of the excess liquidity come off the bond portfolios to support that growth ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah i mean its a complicated question a lot of moving parts right the first thing obviously the level of ddas like we answered before i mean weve said it could be billion it could be billion or it could be billion so the overall mix of deposits and timing of some institutional deposits coming in could impact our deposit costs but all of that as i said in my prepared comments we are close to of our book that are priced at market rates that will move immediately or pretty quickly after the fed cuts rates right and we still have about billion of fixedrate loans thatll continue to reprice higher in the next months because they are at call it basis points below where current market rates are so thats a positive as well and then the third positive obviously is whats happening in our securities book with about billion of cash flows coming due at ph billion and getting priced basis points basis points higher so a lot of positive momentum on one side and then the other side is just we have or of our loans are variable in nature of them are tied to sofr or prime rates so when that happens sofr moves in advance of what the fed might do so that might impact loan yields on the other side so a lot of moving parts as im saying and obviously this is true for the next two or three quarters before we layer on the heartland acquisition so i would say given id stick to my original comments that we expect it to be stable again itll be dictated by what happens to mix of deposits including ddas mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp and loan growth umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp and loan growth yeah nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp we will also be accretive to your point yeah yeah nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then you just continue to see kind of good momentum on the institutional fee income im just curious if we can get an update in terms of the opportunities youre seeing across those lines and just kind of any thoughts on just kind of activity levels and if you can kind of continue to sustain the growth rate that weve seen over the last year or so across institutional ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thats another one of my favorite questions i love our credit quality questions and i love our institutional growth questions just ill take up couple of things and let jim add on if i miss anything since the business lines report to him but we continue to be positioned very well across the board but in particular a couple of things in ai alternatives investments within our asset servicing business is very very strong the profile is very strong theres a lot of fund creation a lot of fundraising going on a lot of growth within some major clients that we have we continue to see a really strong pipeline there and then a lot of growth within the customer base so that is the profile there continues to be very strong and i think the disruption in the space with our competitors being bought and sold also had continued to be very helpful so thats a really strong business with strong profile and a great tailwind corporate trust continues to be fantastically strong and i think the strength in travel and all that has really pushed a lot of activity in the airline business which is coming on our clo business and such that we are building in that space is again have real great tailwinds and really good time hiring people in the space and again just consolidation and hiring has been really great for us in that space so we continue to feel good about that but the rest of them are all strong those are some with real momentum and outsized profiles our wealth business interestingly also has a great profile right now the sales activity and new generation of assets under management there have been very strong and so thats nicely up quarteroverquarter and year overyear anything you might add jim james d rine a president chief executive officer umb bank na investment management no no the only thing i would nate is just as you know the corporate trust business is also a great contributor to our deposit base and we have the ability to move if they get if they balloon we can move it off balance umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 sheet we have the ability to keep it on balance sheet really built that out nicely or continue to invest so outlook for those businesses continues to remain very strong ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp and healthcare continues like i said all the businesses are strong profile for all of them are strong but theres some real momentum in corporate trust and ai within this the whole set nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay very helpful thank you for that if i could just add one more just in terms of thinking about expenses next year now it looks like you guys arent planning to convert the systems until the fourth quarter of next year so just curious to what extent or what degree of cost saves you guys need you can realize assuming you close the deal early next year ahead of the cost save or im sorry ahead of the conversion later in the year mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp well i mean well as they come in and we execute against them well report on them its probably premature to tell you how when and its too early really to report on that but we would intend obviously to segregate and report on those synergies and savings as they come through every quarter thomas s terry a chief credit officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah and nothing changed from our announcement if you go back we expected based on firstquarter close and the fourthquarter conversion that we would get of that cost saves in the first in the timeframe and then everything else in and beyond so no change from that perspective as of now nate mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp and youll see as i said that the projections for all the same so youll see it come through as it comes through nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great i appreciate all the color thanks guys thomas s terry a chief credit officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks nate operator thank you our next question comes from the line of john rodis with janney john your line is now open john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc good morning everybody just umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc just a just a followup ram maybe on fees i guess brokerage line item if we start to see some fed cuts can you hold that level or does that start to decline a little bit ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp no thats no it takes a lot of fed cuts for that to be impacted on the negative side it has to be basis points or plus400 basis points of cuts before it impacts the money market revenue share so theres no risk of that to jims earlier point were still seeing opportunities to add off balance sheet and maybe even generate some but i would not expect nearterm impacts because of revenue shares going that way until the fed cuts fairly dramatically mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp and quite frankly i think the way we see it is its more if rates come down activity will go up so therell be more activity so on the margin anyway as that would hit over time wed see more volume also john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay okay makes sense mariner thank you and then just one other on fees the bankcard fees youre million to million now and just talking your previous comments about strong trends and stuff and so you feel thats up from million to million a quarter last year so this sort of new level of million to million seems appropriate going forward ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah one of the biggest drivers so obviously purchase volumes even organically have grown up nicely right we used to be at billion of purchase volumes every quarter a lot of it driven by healthcare now we have a lot of momentum as youve heard from our fee income lines on commercial where our purchase volume is growing strongly and the biggest catalyst in the second quarter is the ph million of cobranded card balances that we acquired so that new business generated about gross million of purchase volumes fees of net of interchange or net interchange fees of about million so thats part of the organic and inorganic growth drivers for us but we feel pretty good at the higher level it can go up and down from quarter to quarter based on timing of incentives from the network or other things but generally we feel like the momentum is positive mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 we also had a couple large new relationships on the institutional side that had card relationships that are really starting to drive some big volume there so i would say its up from near neutral i mean the trends are upwardsloping john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay thanks guys ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks john operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of timur braziler with wells fargo timur your line is now open ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp hey timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc good morning ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc i wanted to i wanted to follow up just on the margin outlook for as it pertains to bond book it seems at least like much of the bond growth occurred later in the quarter and the amount of repricing was elevated in compared to whats coming online over the next four quarters im just wondering how much of that repricing took place in the back end of the quarter and if thats not more of a tailwind as we go into for margin ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp no the backend balance increase that youre seeing as we footnoted in one of our pages timetotime especially at monthend that we described earlier theres a lot of collateral needs for trust deposits and institutional time deposits so we end up buying those so those maybe inflating what youre looking at but generally across the three months in a quarter were always looking at every quarter to whether we want to reinvest based on our loantodeposit ratio pipeline and all that so i would not expect a tailwind because of the latequarter purchases i mean again this is just to satisfy collateral needs over the last two days of the quarter and the first two days of the following or the last two days of the month and the following two days so and theres no tailwind to be expected in the third quarter from that umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jul2024 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then maybe a followup on the heartland deal im just wondering the fact that youre essentially acquiring smaller institutions versus one larger one is that an opportunity as those are kind of consolidated together and brought under one general operating model or is that a nearterm risk as that consolidation kind of maybe offset some of the planned benefits at least in the near term of the deal closing mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp thats a great question and it was really one of the exciting things about executing this transaction really one of the things that excited us is that they started a journey two years ago basically to set themselves up to look like us over the next five and years and this acquisition just accelerates all that work so theyve done id said i think early on in one of our calls they planted the seeds and filled the soil and we get the harvest so theyve done all the hard work theyve consolidated the systems and we had to come in and sort of layer in all the things that we do and so i guess i would say not a lot of risk to that really more opportunity and the leverage the work that theyve already done so were pretty excited about it we can just kind of come in and like i said leverage the work theyve done so dont see any risk there really all opportunity timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks for that color mariner ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks timur operator thank you there are no
