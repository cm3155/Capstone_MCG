 earnings call 31jan2024 thank you kay and good morning before i get started ive got to talk about some very important business like congratulating our hometown heroes the kansas city chiefs who are yet again headed to the super bowl in a couple of weeks now id like to discuss our fourth quarter and full year performance for a year that played out very differently from what we were expecting and i think the rest of you were expecting last year during a particularly challenging period for the banking industry umb delivered strong results demonstrating the power and resilience of our diversified business model we closed out the year with a solid fourth quarter ill review a few highlights and then ram will add more detail in the financial drivers section as you know most banks recognize the expense for the fdic special assessment in the fourth quarter our share of the assessment was million an impact of about per share pretax to net income we presented our financial metrics both on a gaap basis and adjusted to exclude this charge for the full year of net income was million or a share on an adjusted basis net operating income was million or per share for the fourth quarter we earned million or a share however as adjusted net operating income was million or per share representing an increase of compared to the third quarter of and compared to the fourth quarter a year ago our results reflected strong loan growth and deposit growth expanding net interest margin and net interest income solid fee income growth and exceptional asset quality average loan balances increased on an annualized basis from the third quarter to billion for comparison banks between billion and billion in assets that have reported results so far have shown an annualized increase of we posted strong top line production above third quarter and in line with our levels in recent quarters construction and commercial real estate drove most of our loan growth in the fourth quarter with continued draws on previously approved construction loans payoff levels increased to of loans impacting ci balances cre growth has been largely in multifamily and industrial projects once again weve included more detail on the portfolio in our slides showing the mix of loans by type and geography along with ltvs and other metrics asset quality in the book remains strong we adhere to conservative standards which includes underwriting to imputed or stressed interest rates and moderate loantovalue ratios we dont use trended rents and we have very strong liquid sponsors with great cash flow of our investment cre portfolio is recoursed speaking of asset quality we reported excellent metrics with improvements across the board nonperforming loan levels improved again to basis points while delinquency levels declined and we saw an decrease in classified loans net chargeoffs were basis points of average loans for the quarter and just basis points for the full year of again we outperformed peer banks which have reported a median net chargeoff rate for the fourth quarter of basis points so far on slide we included a longer term history of chargeoffs which have averaged just basis points over the last years in we experienced a basis point reduction in our annual chargeoff rate compared to reflecting the active management of our portfolio im pleased with this result especially given the environment and cautious narrative were hearing across the industry again we compare favorably to peer banks which have reported a median basis point increase in net chargeoff levels yearoveryear moving to deposits average balances increased on an annualized basis from the third quarter this growth was led by commercial customers including a annualized increase in commercial dda balances we umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jan2024 are seeing traction from our effort to bring clients total banking relationships to umb peers so far have seen average annualized deposit growth of just thus far in the quarter net interest income increased as margin improved basis points sequentially from industry reports so far our nim expansion compares favorably with peers reporting a median decline of basis points we continue to deploy cash flows from the securities portfolio into loans and the pace of increased funding costs has slowed each of the past two quarters ram will share more detail and drivers on our margin outlook for noninterest income for the fourth quarter was million representing of revenue more than two times the median reported by peers our fee businesses continue to build scale and were seeing momentum in several areas a few highlights include fund services where assets under administration have eclipsed billion a billion improvement over levels and in our custody business we have had a increase in net new accounts this year our fixed income and trading teams saw increased activity as the expectation that the fed has finished raising rates and has provided a little more clarity and brought some participants back into the market weve shared additional detail on our fee income businesses and the revenue thats provided by them in our slides and ram will add more detail when he speaks total revenue for the fourth quarter increased from a linked quarter basis we posted positive operating leverage of on a linked quarter basis and in the yearoveryear quarter as seen on slide our capital position improved during the fourth quarter with a basis point increase in both cet and total capital ratios which stood at and respectively our earnings continue to support our capital position in spite of the impact of the fdic special assessment finally we saw increased profitability ratios with operating rotce of versus in the third quarter tangible book value improved nearly from september to per share peer banks so far have reported a median tangible book value increase of in the quarter overall we had a very solid quarter especially given the challenging year we all had before i turn it over to ram id like to share a few thoughts on the events of last spring that ultimately led to the fdics special assessment we recognized in the fourth quarter it has become very clear that the underlying cause of the bank failures was interest rate mismatch primarily on the asset side a few banks were ill positioned and poorly managed for the interest rate environment we found ourselves in with a largely fixed asset base that lacked flexibility one lesson learned during that time was the power of various market participants to fuel a largely mediabased crisis and circus as the panic spread across media outlets the risk of a selffulfilling prophecy became real our reputation with our clients and in our markets is something we have earned and cherished over years of history it was extremely frustrating for us to watch these industry observers pontificate based on a lack of understanding of how the industry works and continue to focus on the wrong symptoms like unadjusted uninsured deposits or aoci this was a classic case of facts getting in the way of a good narrative as ive said before thank you to you the analysts and the investors on the call with us today who took the time and care to understand the thematic of what transpired in the spring yearend reports have confirmed what we already knew to be true the fundamentals in this industry remain steady the demise of regional banks didnt happen as predicted and banks like ours that were wellprepared have not only weathered the storm but emerged stronger and with positive results the resiliency of the banking industry has been evident and on umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jan2024 display in recent months and the liquidity regulatory capital levels loan portfolio asset quality and funding sources remain strong in closing im incredibly proud of our umb associates that drove this performance and im deeply grateful to our loyal client base that grew with us through this much exaggerated industry noise in it was extremely rewarding to see how our company and customers came together to support each other as always we run our company with a strong focus on both the shortterm and the longterm performance through every stage and every economic cycle and we feel good about our strategy looking ahead into we see a muted but resilient macro environment and we remain wellpositioned for any environment with an attractive loantodeposit level strong capital ratios and high quality loan portfolio with that ill turn it over to ram to give you more details on our results ram ram shankar chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks mariner net interest income increased million in the fourth quarter to million driven primarily by loan growth and repricing along with higher levels of liquidity net interest margin was an increase of basis points from the linked quarter loan repricing and mix provided a basis point benefit other positives included basis points from the benefit of free funds and liquidity levels including stable levels of dda balances basis points from the securities portfolio and basis point from changes in borrowing levels these benefits were partially offset by higher deposit costs cycle to date our earning asset beta has been tracking along with our total cost of funds beta both now at average deposits increased annualized from the third quarter benefiting from the ongoing deposit gathering initiatives across all our lines of businesses the typical seasonal increase in public fund balances during the month of december added million in average deposits for the quarter these increases were partially offset by the intentional reduction in brokered cd balances excluding those brokered deposits average deposits increased annualized from the prior quarter additionally corporate trust deposits tend to be a little bit lumpy as clients build up cash and make payments throughout the year as the third largest municipal trustee in the us balances will ebb and flow driven by municipal bond distributions and other activity ill note that on an endofperiod basis corporate trust deposits increased pointing to the timing differences throughout the quarter in our escrow specialty trust and paying agent businesses our deposit remix continued at a slower pace this quarter dda balances increased from the third quarter and now represent of total average deposits providing the benefit to margin i noted cycletodate betas on total deposits and on loan yields are and respectively this is on track with our previously discussed expectations for terminal betas of approximately for deposits and for loans looking ahead into the first quarter we expect our loan yields will continue to benefit from the flexibility weve built into our balance sheet through repricing as loans come up for renewal and from higher yields on new origination overall we expect our loan yields to meet or exceed the increases in cost of funds additionally we have approximately billion in cash flows from our securities portfolio rolling off at that will be reinvested in higher yielding loans or securities in the fourth quarter we began legging back in with some modest repurchases of mortgagebacked and treasury securities we will continue to assess based on collateral umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jan2024 needs loan growth and overall market conditions as liquidity and public fund balances seasonally dissipate and given one less day in the first quarter we expect net interest income and margin to compress modestly from fourth quarter levels actual performance will be driven by material shifts in funding mix especially dda balances and the shape of the curve details and activities in our securities portfolio are shown on slides and the combined afs and held to maturity portfolios averaged billion during the quarter a decline of from the third quarter the average rolloff yield was for the quarter the new purchases of million shown on the table excluded million of shortterm tbills purchased at as additional collateral for public funds deposit excluding those treasuries we expect billion of securities with a yield of to roll off over the next months the unrealized loss position in our combined securities book improved this quarter to billion representing approximately of the total portfolio down from in the third quarter back to the income statement our provision expense of zero this quarter was the result of the impact of payoffs on net loan growth the quality of our portfolio including the low level of net chargeoffs and macroeconomic variables that seem to expect a softer landing as we look into the first quarter we expect provision to be impacted by a small acquisition of a cobrand credit card portfolio expected to close in march which will add approximately million in balances with a day one provision of roughly million and ongoing provision based on portfolio performance growth and macroeconomic variables this acquisition will also add approximately million in net interest income million in interchange fees and a breakeven pretax preprovision in the first year excluding conversion and integration costs on the fee income side reported results included some marketrelated variances including increases of million in companyowned life insurance income and in customerrelated derivative income trading and investment banking income increased million primarily related to municipal trading volume the detailed drivers of noninterest expense are shown in our slides and press release and on a gaap basis included the recognition of the million fdic special assessment on an operating basis expenses increased million or from the third quarter to million detailed variances are included on slide but the largest impacts were million in deferred compensation expense an increase of million from the prior quarter this is the offset to the increased coli income million related to the prebuy of computers in the fourth quarter and million in additional charitable contributions partial offsets included a million decrease in payroll taxes insurance and 401k expense and a reduction in bonus and commissions expense excluding the onetime items and timingrelated variances our core expense run rate in the fourth quarter was approximately million please note that in addition to the impact of the cobrand card portfolio acquisition first quarter salary and benefits expense will increase with the impact of the extra leap year day and for the typical seasonal reset of fica and payroll taxes our effective tax rate was for the full year compared to in the decreased rate was driven primarily by a larger portion of income from taxexempt securities and variations in levels of coli income for we would expect a similar tax rate ranging from to that concludes our prepared remarks and ill now turn it back over to the operator to begin the qa portion of the call umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jan2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from chris mcgratty of kbw please go ahead nicholas moutafakis q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi this is nick moutafakis on for chris ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp hey good morning nick mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hey there nicholas moutafakis q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi maybe just to start out on the margin given the potential for rate cuts coming later in this year in could we see the margin continue to expand into with more back book repricing and the continued mix shift ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah sure nick this is ram and we dont give any forward guidance other than what i said in my prepared comments about there might be some modest compression in the first quarter because of the excess liquidity that we saw in the fourth quarter going away but as we said in the past calls right the higher for longer scenario is a good scenario for us because as youve seen in the last couple of quarters the pressure on deposit costs have largely abated for us and then our loan yields are still repricing higher so loan yields will at least do better than cost of funds for us and then theres billion of securities that are rolling off at that we can invest in the current rate environment so i think were close to the trough on margin any particular quarter it might have been slow a little bit of a few basis points here and there but feel good about our margin trajectory until the fed starts cutting at some point in mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp and some of the nuance one way or the other the strength of what happens with our demand deposits also hangs in the balance nicholas moutafakis q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jan2024 great thank you and maybe it also depends on the revenue outlook i guess a little bit but could we see positive operating leverage in depending on the expense growth mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp well i think that we remain focused on operating leverage and again based on the guidance question we dont really give guidance what i would say is that the environment that we come into with from remains from a standpoint of elevated interest expense and the interest rate environment and because of that demonstrating absolute strength on the operating leverage remains challenging well continue to do everything we can and work against it we believe on a relative basis that well outperform on operating leverage nicholas moutafakis q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you for taking my questions ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks nick operator thank you operator instructions we have a question from nathan race of piper sandler please go ahead your line is open nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah hi guys good morning and congrats mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hey good morning nathan nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co on the win just a question on the nii sensitivity i appreciate the disclosure in the deck around basis point decline in rates is about a impact to nii in year two just curious how to what extent you think that it can be offset by just the volume of kind of continued margin accretive growth in both loans and deposits going forward and also with the cash flow you have coming off the securities portfolio as well ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah you hit the nail on the head there nate that is a static analysis as you know right so its all based on just cash flows coming in and being reinvested in new environment and so the net interest income projected in that baseline scenario of minus in year two does not include the impact of any growth and any actions we might take right youve seen us and youll see in our disclosures that we put on some swap synthetic hedges as well so well do additional well evaluate it on a periodic basis and put on additional hedges to protect ourselves from a down rate environment but thats just a statistical modeling of what would happen to our umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jan2024 balance sheet if all things were kept the same on a static balance sheet basis so we can take steps to mitigate it and so thats another layer that well add on to it mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp and as you think about looking forward into we typically give you a 90day look forward loan growth in the first quarter looks stronger than it did in the fourth quarter so signs continue to be good nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then just within that context around kind of the nii trajectory in deposit costs i think you guys have about billion in wholesale funding maturing in the first half of this year how are you guys thinking about replacing the cash flow off the securities ph book is it going to be one lever and then any other kind of thoughts on just how we should think about those wholesale sources in the first half of the year ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah on page nate yeah on page on the bottom right we have all the wholesale funding obviously as you can see we have about billion of brokered cds given our deposit pipeline which remains strong we might not need all of it right so but theres a potential the way what market rates are at that point and we may leg in for half of it or something less than that the other one thats maturing that will mature in the second quarter is billion of flhb advances and then we have btfp which will extend into january again well evaluate it based on collateral needs well base it on where market rates are well look for spread and all those things but we dont need any of those tools really given our liquidity position and our loan to deposit but well take it as the environment evolves mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah and i think that rams comment about the brokered cds is we may we dont need them but we may roll back into some of them just because by the time they come due rates will likely have come down and we can have positive arbitrage on them so might make sense to roll back into some of them just from a profitability standpoint nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay got it very helpful maybe just turning to credit curious to hear perhaps from tom in terms of what occurred in the quarter in terms of criticized classified trends and obviously chargeoffs have been very low over the last few quarters and i think in the past weve talked about a normalized chargeoff range in the basis point to basis point range so just curious just given where npa stands and based on the commentary around criticized trends if you think were going to get back to that historical range at some point this year or into mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp nate thats my favorite question because its the thing that were really most proud of and i think that when you think i think about this investor community and looking at your alternatives and the investment thesis looking into banks that the thing that you look at with us is im sitting at the table right here with two other guys that have umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jan2024 been making credit decisions with me for years through all of the cycles that weve looked at and weve outperformed the peer group in all of those cycles and when we talk about basis points basis points were just using math history if you look at page you just youre just looking at our history and one thing i would note about that in our investment deck is while yeah the average over years is higher than the basis points we have in the fourth quarter you have to recognize that comes with a lot of growth so if you go back years ago the first year i was ceo we had billion in loans with basis points of chargeoff today we have billion in loans with basis points of chargeoff so in the context of much greater opportunity for loss weve maintained a very very low chargeoff rate and thats because of consistency and continuity of approach and we make this easy for you guys because you can look at the history most of the banks you look at have different teams and turnover and change and strategy change and acquisitions or whatever it is youre staring at the same company with the same team same results and what i would say about the basis points when you think about this year and where wherever we end up we will outperform and what i if you look at the chargeoff history over the last years us against the peer we had a chart the second the page before that shows that its in a different its in a you we have a chart that shows us against a peer group and if you the point is if you look at a recessionary period our line our doubtful line stays very close to the bottom axis of a chart while theres a shark fin that takes place with the industry so thats what happened in the last crisis we expect that to happen if you look at it through the fourth quarter its you can see its already taking place our numbers dont move and the peer groups and the industry is starting to move up we expect that to be the case again whatever the absolute numbers are i cant tell you but the relationship to the peer group and the industry we expect to remain the same nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great very helpful and just one last one it seems like a lot of the growth in the quarter came on the commercial real estate side of things so just curious in terms of the composition of the pipeline entering and kind of where you guys are seeing pretty pronounced opportunities to grow loans today mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp loan growth weve been saying this for a really long time we call it the we have a long runway for growth both geographically vertically across our footprint international footprint related to our abl business largely because of market share gains we expect that to remain the same the caveat to that would be if we do have a softening economy the rate at which we would grow on an absolute basis may come down from what our expectations are of ourselves but on a relative basis we would expect ourselves to continue to outperform on loan growth for the same reasons we always have for years weve done that and we expect that to continue again for the same very same reasons which would be more market sharedriven than they are economic conditionsdriven so nothing new there the absolute number could come down a bit from what we did last year based on what the economic conditions are but again youre buying on a relative basis and we expect ourselves to outperform on a relative basis again umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jan2024 ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp market specific its still coming from the major metros utah has been a nice growth market for us where we have loan production office and that team is continuing to build but we are seeing a strong traditional operating company ci and as mariner stated its market sharedriven mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp and first quarter as i said looks stronger than quarter indiscernible if thats any indication right we have a harder time ourselves looking beyond the first quarter but first quarter is if first quarter is an indication of the rest of the year its stronger than the fourth quarter pipelinewise nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay understood very helpful and if i could just ask one last one do you guys see any change in credit ratings across i think around of loans that are tied to office cre mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp im not sure i understand the credit rating question what do you help me understand that nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co risk rating excuse me mariner thomas s terry a chief credit officer executive vice president umb financial corp so nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co have you see any negative migration thomas s terry a chief credit officer executive vice president umb financial corp this is tom terry nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co indiscernible risk rating excuse me mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp oh okay go ahead umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 31jan2024 thomas s terry a chief credit officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah weve had very little if any deterioration in our office portfolio which remains strong with of the portfolio as you said a couple of statistics of our office portfolio is single tenant which adds a layer of strength there in terms of rollover strong sponsors which weve talked about in the past we have seen basically no deterioration in that portfolio and dont really see anything coming on the horizon theyre performing a lot of the leases the underlying leases on these office projects go out to and beyond roughly of those leases are and beyond so in terms of rollover in the short term very manageable nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect i appreciate the color thank you ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks thanks nathan mariner kemper chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah thanks everybody looks like thats the last question just want to reiterate something were really proud of the year we had in the quarter and i think at the end of the day we do what we say and we say what we do and weve been doing it for a long time and weve demonstrated strong outsized loan growth deposit growth fees expense control year in and year out and i think the good news for the investor population as they think about us is you should know what to expect from us and we did it again in the fourth quarter and were more thrilled than ever about the fourth quarter because we were able to sort of put to bed a lot of the nonsense in the narrative as i like to say dont let facts get in the way of a real exciting narrative that the pundits like to deliver last year and so on behalf of everybody on the call were happy to have delivered what we did in the fourth quarter to kind of put some of that nonsense to bed and so well just keep doing it for you and were really proud and excited about what we delivered and were just going to keep doing it for you so thanks kay gregory senior vice president directorinvestor relations umb financial corp thanks mariner if anyone has a followup you can always reach us at and we appreciate your time
