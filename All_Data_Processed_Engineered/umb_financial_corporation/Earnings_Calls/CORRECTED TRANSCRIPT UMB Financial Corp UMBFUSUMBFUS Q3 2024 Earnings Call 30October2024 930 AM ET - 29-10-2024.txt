mariner kemper chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp thank you kay and good morning everyone thanks for joining us as we discuss our third quarter results announced yesterday afternoon we had another solid quarter with strong fee business performance and near doubledigit annualized loan growth driven by record top line loan production of billion our line utilization has remained steady at to over the past several quarters and our loan pipeline remains strong heading into the fourth quarter overall were pleased with the strength of both sides of our balance sheet as well as the robust tractions in many of our fee income businesses we reported gaap earnings of million or per share driven by continued momentum across our various lines of business on an operating basis we earned per share the increase in interest income was driven primarily by continued loan growth and higher levels of liquidity partially offset by changes in funding mix the strength of our diversified financial model was evident this quarter with strong fee income growth from several areas including within our institutional business where assets under administration exceeded trillion trading and investment banking volumes increased largely in municipal and mortgagebacked securities driving a linked quarter increase in fee income in corporate trust higher off balance sheet money market balances contributed to stronger fees in the quarter and our private wealth teams have brought in billion in net new assets yeartodate or ahead of fullyear levels we focus on operating leverage rather than specific expense growth target so compared to the third quarter a year ago we posted positive operating leverage of on an operating basis ram will provide more detail on income and expense drivers shortly balance sheet growth included a linked quarter annualized increase in average loan balances in contrast to many of our peers comments on anemic loan growth and slowing utilization in fact for banks reported so far the median annualized increase in average loan balances has been just loan growth was led by commercial real estate with multifamily balances posting linked quarter growth and by construction draws on previously approved lines we also saw a solid ci activity with some increased ma activity among our clients credit quality in our loan portfolio remains excellent and a hallmark of our business as evidenced by just basis points of net chargeoffs on a yeartodate basis and nonperforming loans of just basis points of total loans over the past eight quarters our nonperforming ratio has averaged just basis points compared to basis points for our peer group and basis points for the industry as a whole ci continues to perform well with just basis points of net chargeoff for the quarter and net recoveries three out of the last four quarters credit card is typically the largest component of our net chargeoffs and that was the case again in the third quarter we have heard some consumerheavy lenders discuss borrowers at risk and several anecdotal comments from retail participants in the retail sector seeming to support that sentiment for umb however consumer credit card represents just of average total loan balances and typically makes up approximately to of credit card purchase volume most of our credit card net chargeoffs for the quarter stemmed from our recent portfolio acquisition which had a different credit profile than we normally underwrite for context these acquired balances averaged million for the third quarter on the flip side relative to our original expectation the portfolio yields on these acquired balances have also outperformed excluding losses on credit cards our net chargeoff rate this quarter would have been only basis points umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2024 the higher provision expense in the quarter largely reflects the impact of loan growth along with some general portfolio trends our coverage ratio increased to of total loans average total deposits grew million or on a linked quarter annualized basis including the intentional reduction of brokered cd balances for comparison banks that have reported third quarter results so far had a median annualized growth in deposits of just while commercial dda balances increased on an annualized basis overall average dda balances declined largely driven by tax payments and other activity in asset servicing and corporate trust as weve discussed in the past these cash distributions by our large institutional clients can be episodic in nature and there is some seasonality in the balances especially among municipal and corporate trust indiscernible finally were on track to complete our pending acquisition of heartland financial subject to approvals and have updated milestones and progress on the integration planning in the deck our integration teams are collaborating well as they scale up and we are well on our way with preparations for legal deadline still anticipated for some time in the first quarter again we believe this transaction will accelerate umbs growth strategy further diversifying and derisking our business model the addition of this highquality franchise is a great fit from a strategic financial and cultural perspective and we look forward to serving our prospective clients and geographies as well as welcoming new associates to umb now ill turn it over to ram ram shankar chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks mariner net interest income of million represented an increase of million or just under reflecting continued loan growth and higher levels of liquidity partially offset by the higher cost related to a funding mix shift the mix shift was driven both by a billion increase in average interestbearing deposit balances as well as the million decrease in dda which impacted net interest margin by basis points as we noted our dda balances can fluctuate based on the activity of our institutional clients which may include tax and bond payments as part of being the trustee or funds that were deployed in the market in the asset servicing business additionally as mariner noted activity from our corporate trust and specialty trust clients can be lumpy and episodic in nature as a result our dda balances were at the lower end of the billion to billion range weve seen in recent quarters and generally represent the low point of the year from a seasonality perspective average interestbearing liabilities increased with increases in interestbearing deposits partially offset by a decrease of million in borrowed funds as noted on slide of the deck we further reduced borrowing levels following quarterend paying off million in btfp prior to its contractual maturity in january while the btfp balances contributed million in net interest income in the third quarter it was almost basis points dilutive to net interest margin additionally the million in both fhlb advances and brokered cds matured earlier in october which should also benefit margin going forward net interest margin for the third quarter decreased basis points sequentially to largely due to the decline in average dda balances as you can see from our yield tables net interest spread was unchanged from the linked quarter as the benefit of free funds declined basis points and impacted margin looking into the fourth quarter we expect net interest margin to improve a few basis points from the third quarter driven by wholesale funding maturities i noted earlier as well as the catchup of repricing actions on indexed deposits from the midseptember rate cut this may be partially offset by delayed loan repricing on loans tied to umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2024 sofr and prime as well as the impacts of continued contraction in onemonth sofr rates in advance of anticipated rate cuts in november and december as you are aware the onemonth sofr rate has declined basis points through last week in advance of the expected basis point cut on november i will add my usual caveat that the trajectory of our margin will depend on the timing and pace of interest rate cuts levels of activity primarily in our institutional businesses that can impact the mix of our liabilities and the overall pricing environment for loans and deposits as an additional reminder approximately of our total deposits are hard indexed to shortterm interest rates as the fed funds rate changes these deposits reprice down immediately an additional of our deposits are soft indexed balances negotiated at current prevailing market rates on these softindexed deposits we will generally move rates down pretty quickly following fed cuts overall we continue to expect our deposit betas on the way down to be steeper than peer banks similar to our experience during the tightening cycle we estimate that for the basis point rate cut that happened in september we were able to garner close to betas on our indexed deposits while the cost of interestbearing deposits increased quarteroverquarter due to new institutional deposit growth the cost of ratebearing deposits in september declined basis points from august compared to a basis point decline in loan yields our interest rate simulation results on page of our deck show us benefiting from interest rate cuts in year one with a more modest benefit for year two our projections now show up slightly liability sensitive based on a static balance sheet as of september and current market assumptions for interest rates and prepayments as a reminder this analysis does not include any interest income generated from new growth or the htlf acquisition at this preliminary stage we estimate that our pro forma interest rate position will remain relatively neutral on the right side of page weve added more detail on loan repricing including timing of rate adjustments for both sofr and prime indexed loans the timing of movements in sofr rates in advance of the fomc action had an immaterial impact to the third quarter given the midseptember timing as the fomc meets and act sooner in the quarter it is likely that sofr also moves ahead of anticipated fed actions resulting in some timing differences between when loans and indexed deposits reprice weve also added details on slide about the hedges we have in place currently we have billion notional value in indiscernible cash flow hedges which include three floor contracts and eight floor spreads details and activity in our securities portfolio are shown on slide and in our deck the combined afs and htm portfolios averaged billion during the quarter relatively flat from the prior quarter levels security levels fluctuate based on our collateral needs for both public funds and trust businesses the average purchase yield in our portfolio was for the third quarter while securities rolling off at a yield of we expect billion of securities with an average yield of to roll off over the next months pricing on new investments in september averaged and are subject to change depending on what happens in the middle part of the treasury curve capital levels continue to build with our common equity tier ratio increasing basis points to as announced yesterday the board of directors declared a increase in the quarterly dividend rate to per share payable in january weve seen continued growth in tangible book value per share which increased from june to tangible book value per share has grown more than over the past year as a reminder our capital levels do not include the million forward equity offering agreement that we announced in april turning back to the income statement noninterest income was million a linked quarter increase of aside from the impact of marketrelated variances which include security valuation changes and coli income umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2024 the largest driver of fee income was trust and securities processing where the strong fund services and corporate trust activity mariner mentioned is captured this income line has seen steady increases in recent quarters other drivers of the linked quarter increase were million of additional income from both investment banking and brokerage income and million gain on the sale of a building partially offset by lower healthcarerelated deposit service charges noninterest expense of million for the quarter included pretax acquisition expenses of million and an additional reduction of million in previously accrued fdic assessment charges on an operating basis non interest expense increased million in linked quarter and included a million increase in variable bonus and commission expense as strong performance in several of the businesses resulted in higher incentive accruals salary and benefits expense was also impacted by one more salary day in the third quarter we purchased additional laptops and computer equipment during the quarter driving an increase of million in supply costs the million increase in deferred compensation expense is the offset related to the higher coli income finally our effective tax rate was for the quarter compared to in the third quarter of on a year todate basis the increase in tax rate was primarily related to lower income on tax exempt securities and higher nondeductible acquisition costs in for the fullyear we would expect the tax rate to range between and looking ahead to our preliminary estimate including the htlf acquisition is an effective tax rate of to now ill turn it over to the operator for the qa session question and answer section operator thank you we will now open the call for your questions operator instructions and our first question today will be from the line of ben gerlinger with citi please go ahead your line is now open benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc all right good morning everyone mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp hey good morning ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc i was curious if you could talk through the pricing and deposits a little bit more i know ram you gave quite a bit of detail on negotiated versus index and all that so with the basis point cut late in as we kind of roll through i was curious if you can shed some light on any anecdotal or data in terms of pricing that youre seeing as weve kind of flipped in the here in pricing trends or defaults and then also the mix itself any commentary would be really helpful umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2024 mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp can you take that ram ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah sure as i said on the prepared comments that still about of our deposits are what we call hard indexed right so those are very formulaic based on what a fed effective rate might be so those are not immediately and then theres another that are negotiated rates or what we call soft indexed rate so if you look at our total deposit pie between those two have prevailing market rates upwards of today that we as i said in my prepared remarks we got anecdotally close to beta on those on the first basis points cut but the remaining is ddas and then there is a back book call it that on a lower rate so that kind of gives you a timeframe or a framework for what might happen to deposit costs again these are all based on what happens to shortterm interest rates and they happen within hours days of when the fed might build their rates mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp and ben i might add also third quarter is a low point for ddas related to seasonality for us so theres probably likely a dda build in the fourth quarter that was not there in the third quarter benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you no thats helpful let me ask it differently so when you lower something obviously theres a negotiated component to it but are you seeing any pushback on anything or are you lets say indiscernible as clients see the price or their yield on deposits move lower index i totally get is contractual and theres the negotiated aspect are you seeing pushback in anything even though its bps or not mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp there is no push back on the index theres very little pushback on the soft indexed and then the back book works the way we work anywhere but theres an expectation from the client that rates are dropping we dont have any real sense that thats a challenge havent heard anything benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you okay thats helpful and then if i could ask a question about fee income it seems like everything was all systems go like all silos or all the horses seem to be pulling in the same direction for this quarter i know you highlighted a couple of noncore items in the prepared remarks when you think about the sustainability going into do you exclude kind of the couple of onetime items you called out ram is this a fair starting off point is like a base or would you say this is a little bit overheated to some extent on the numbers ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah i wouldnt call it overheated ben as you had rightly summarized all systems and all our fee income businesses have been performing well we had a lot of off balance sheet deposit growth that gave us additional fees and our off balance sheet deposits are at billion and growing our fund services as i said in my umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2024 prepared remarks has been on all cylinders for the last few quarters alternative investments brokerage income our trading investment banking income was another strong quarter because we are seeing a lot of demand for municipal and mortgagebacked securities both on the bank and nonbank qualified side so the only noncore quartertoquarter audio gap is the million on the gain on the sale of a building and then periodically we have coli which have an equal offset on the deferred comp side and then the last one is marktomarket on equity holdings that happens all the quarter so we feel pretty good about our fee income trajectory and probably the businesses are doing card services is another one where weve seen interchange income grow you can see the purchase volume on one of our slides is growing pretty well still so feel pretty good entering into mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp indiscernible profile and pipeline are really strong across all those businesses benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you i jump the call ill step back in the queue mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks ben operator our next question today is from the line of jared shaw with barclays please go ahead your line is now open jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning thanks maybe first mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc just looking at the hey good morning im just looking at the paydown in some of the wholesale borrowings youve talked about was that do you just use cash for that or should we be expecting the cash balances trending down here ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah we did use cash for that we were in excess liquidity position and you should expect some diminution in cash balances at the fed account yes umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2024 jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay indiscernible ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah excess liquidity yeah jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc yeah and then when we look at the dda accounts average versus end of period theres obviously a lot of variability there but how should we be thinking about sort of the trending of that average dda balance over the next few quarters ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah i would focus only on the average just as we always say our period end balances can be higher million million million name it ddas i go back to what i said in my prepared comments in the recent quarters weve seen the range between billion and billion and as mariner just said third quarter tends to be our seasonally lowest quarter and was closer to the billion between just organic buildup between our institutional and commercial clients and then on the interestbearing side we also see late in the fourth quarter inflow of public funds thats about million typically on a net typical season that we get in weighted towards december so we feel pretty good about our deposit pipeline for the fourth quarter both on the dda side and the public fund side jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay thanks and then looking on loan growth you talked about you called out the sort of record production levels in the lower utilization rates could we see doubledigit organic growth on lending in if we get sort of a normalization at all of utilization rates mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp well we typically just give a 90day look forward on loan growth and so we did that in the prepared remarks which is that fourth quarter looks strong like the third quarter and the previous quarters before that whether i would say that we remain bullish on our prospects the same way that weve been growing businesses the same way we see growing business in which is market share gains and production activity based on individual officer had capability capacity same way as weve always projected and seeing loan growth so what i would say to answer your question about is there are no impediments to growth that we see in front of us sort of keep us from doing what weve been able to do historically that doesnt mean the impediments cant come along the way but we expect to continue to perform umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2024 jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay great thanks and just finally for me just any update you can give us on expected accretion as part of nii for for loans and securities any sort of update or sharpening the pencil that is as youve gone through the quarter ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp jared i dont have an update we dont typically run rate market accretion i mean we obviously did it due diligence and then the next opportunity will its pretty onerous process so the next opportunity for us will be at close but generally i mean it really depends on the direction of rates on what happens to interest rate marks and weve seen some volatility in recent days really right but when you look back to the announcement day the rates have come down since then so all else being equal thats a positive for what it means upfront in terms of interest rate mark and capital so but i dont have exact numbers for you and we dont typically refresh that analysis until close jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc got it thank you mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah operator our next question today will be from the line of timur braziler with wells fargo please go ahead your line is now open mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning good morning guys maybe starting on the loan growth side and speaking to some of your competitors in the market it seems like the competition for growth has been intensifying im just wondering what you guys are seeing in terms of competition around structure around rates we heard that there may be some looser terms around recourse maybe what youre seeing from a competitive side and your ability to drive the type of loan growth youve been getting mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp i would say that nothing is new and nothing has ever been new and from our vantage point its always very competitive and we play in a an a space best of quality so its always competitive and so nothing new its always competitive and were just really good at winning it umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2024 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then maybe just going back to some of the balance sheet moves this quarter just looking at the deposit side its seasonally weaker quarter for dda that looks like the institutional client acquisition drove up some of the higher cost this quarter i guess what is the end of period kind of transitory component that you would call out do these two maybe balance each other out where dda grows some of the institutional money maybe rolls off i guess what would you classify as being transitory in the third quarter deposit growth ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp i mean these are same clients that have excess balances at each month and quarter in very predictably so i wouldnt call it anything noncore they just have we have an inflated balance at monthend and quarterend because of our clients and what they are doing their businesses mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah the activity of our larger clients are their transactions are very large and theyre very episodic so you just never know when theyre going to happen so its not transitory its just episodic i would say that as indiscernible mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp third quarter go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc no no finish it up mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay i guess i mean the other way i was going to ask that question is period end assets increased billion some wholesale activity kind of whats the starting point for an asset base in mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp assets indiscernible assets or liabilities indiscernible umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2024 mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp we transitioning to assets okay ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah the assets are driven by whats happening on the deposit side so as i said earlier in a normal month end quarterend we might have billion at quarterend that you see in the periodend balance sheet that leaves within the first week following the end of the quarter but then it happens every quarter as clockwork its very predictable its the same clients we have great visibility into those so again we can talk all day about end of period balances but i would focus on what average balances do thats more representative of what their operating account with us is without some volatility or episodic nature timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks timur operator our next question today is from the line of nathan race with piper sandler please go ahead your line is now open nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah hi everyone good morning thanks for taking the questions mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning nathan nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co i know you guys dont typically give guidance on nii but ram just going back to the balance sheet comments and just the expectations for the margin to be up a few basis points and just given what you have repricing in terms of indexed deposits is it fair to assume that nii or at least the pace of growth and nii should increase in relative to ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp short answer yes the balance sheet growth that we saw in third quarter and the anticipated pipeline that mariner talked about for fourth quarter coupled with whats going to happen on the repricing side on the indexed deposits if you recall the last rate cut happened in midseptember and we only have days of activity on the repricing of indexed deposits reflected in our third quarter numbers so thats why i gave you the september umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2024 versus august that was only basis points out of the basis points so yeah i would answer in the affirmative and then as i said the btfp was paid down there might be lower liquidity balances but those all had very minimal impact on nii so yeah i would say fourth quarter growth in nii at least should be more than what you saw in the third quarter mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp and the third quarter is a low point for deposit balances still so nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it makes sense and just curious as youre kind of budgeting for expenses next year as you guys have gotten more familiar with the team at htlf are you still feeling comfortable with the cost save target and getting indiscernible next year are you guys seeing maybe additional cost synergy opportunities as that process is unfolded mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp we are not really refreshing our modeling at this point nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great indiscernible ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp first question we feel comfortable about the nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then just one clarifying question ram on the fees can you remind us in terms of the magnitude of rate cuts that we would need to see for those to be impacted materially ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah this should take another basis points of rate cut before those money market waivers kick in so we got some ways to go if at all mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp plus theres the growth so those businesses continue to grow all of our institutional businesses continue to grow so the balances continue to grow so youve got that working against whatever that would happen when it ever happens umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2024 nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got you and i believe you guys touched on this earlier but just specifically on the fund services and corporate trust and institutional asset growth im sorry revenue growth both of those lines are up lowdouble digits year overyear just curious if you think that pace of growth in those lines in particular is sustainable as you look into mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah ill take that quickly and if jim has anything to add he certainly can i mean the story continues to be the same pipelines are very good across all those businesses we have a pole position in all the businesses on corporate trust were number two in the country fund services were probably the primary alternative services company in the country when theres a lot of ma activity in that space led by private equity themselves and that puts the other service providers that are involved in ma in penalty box with the boardrooms so it puts us kind of out front with the ability to book business and the pipeline just looks continues to look the same in that business and were really excited about the way that looks and institutional custody is also a fast growing part of our business so weve broadened that business beyond just fund servicing we have a big strong institutional custody business thats broking business outside of fund services and so thats its really just coming across the board and on top of the new business we have some very successful big platform clients that as they are successful we are successful so our client base itself continues to grow and have great success in fund services so indiscernible indiscernible james d rine a president president chief executive officerumb bank umb financial corp its a great story and the only thing i would add is you probably follow the announcement that we launched our clo trustee services and that at the end of the day that really rounds out our offering as far as fullservice corporate trust shop if weve upgraded we added additional software investments additional upgrades to the services platform so mariner said in the past that the business is really on fire and that holds true in the fourth quarter mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp the only thing i would add as we didnt was in our comments prepared comments we had talked about that were pretty excited our wealth business is on fire so weve put on billion in new assets in the last quarter or yeartodate rather this year were up billion which is more than we had done yeartodate last year and so were that business is really positioned well all the work that our team has been doing there to really sort of gaining share is really paying off so were really excited about our wealth business kind of going to the next level also nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great i appreciate all the color thank you umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2024 mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks nathan operator our next question today is from the line of david long with raymond james please go ahead your line is now open david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc thank you mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone on the deposit side of things getting away from your indexed deposits maybe looking at new deposit rates what are you looking at for pricing on new rates and is the market rational would you call your competitors rational on deposit pricing following the basis point cut mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp hey ram indiscernible indiscernible david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc okay sorry about that i dont know if it was my or not but looking at deposit pricing i wanted to ask about new deposit and what type of yields youre seeing or rates youre offering on new deposits and how are competitors reacting are they being rational after the basis point cut that the fed made mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah i mean were i think its a rational market i mean its nice because anything were seeing is better than what we were seeing so were kind of gaining on the way down regardless and but as you do campaigns you do reach a little bit of campaigns so weve had some success on the retail front with campaigns and we hope to benefit from those over time as they mature indiscernible but anything were bringing on were bringing on less than we were bringing on before so theres some marginal improvement along the way ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah and then ill add on the institutional side its always a calculus for us between what we can potentially borrow at so when we priced this were always competing with money market funds so our rates tend to be fed umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2024 effective plus or minus which is why we have the indexed deposit book that we have so i would say its been rational across all our lines of businesses and we see periodic checks on the market for retail promotions and then same thing with commercial mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp and on the commercial institutional side theres so much volume and opportunity for us its really just being disciplined about whether we can do better at the window than we can with what were bringing on so theres so much opportunity were able to be disciplined about what were bringing on on the commercial and institutional side and on the retail side were just playing the same game everybody else is with just being out there and trying to build new relationships and theres some marketing costs to that david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thank you no thats some very good color i appreciate it and then on the lending side when youre having conversations with your commercial customers is there a level of rates another or basis points of cuts that you feel like increases your clients appetite to borrow and can maybe add another layer of loan growth for umb mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp i think thats yet to be seen right i mean like we continue to say for us we budget and forecast our loan growth based on market share gains tied to how penetrated we are in any one market and what our capabilities and capacities are and what our longterm customers are doing and what their pipelines look like as far as economic activity if that gets stronger i would say for us certainly there can be some upside to that i think really the way to think about us when you think about the peer group is we have for years weve done approximately our peer group in loan growth regardless of what the economy is so i think the real way to think about it is how we perform on a relative basis as not on an absolute basis so if things get better i would suggest that whatever we were going to do would be marginally better but we still expect to outperform on a relative basis the way we have for years david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks guys appreciate it mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks dave operator operator instructions and our next question is from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead your line is open mariner kemper a chairman chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning chris umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 30oct2024 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great morning ram a question on the balance sheet i mean if i look at your earning assets and then i add in heartlands youre just under billion i guess as you go into to close is there anything i guess on either balance sheet thats kind of prime for restructuring exit optimization i guess im getting that like whats the right earning asset base to be looking at as you close this deal early next year thanks ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah no plans to restructure anything other than what we said at announcement were just going to swap out some of their bonds for what we would hold on our balance sheet so other than that i think the ballpark that you quoted our billion in earning assets and their billion or so were talking about yeah billion of earning assets that should be in the ballpark before christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp any growth nothing new nothing new christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc before growth ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp nothing new really theres nothing new to report that we didnt already disclosed when we did the deal indiscernible christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah got it and then ram getting back to just the deposit betas away from the indexed which is i think pretty youve been pretty transparent about the indexed pieces i guess whats the beta youre assuming either on the rest of the book or the whole book maybe this quarter and then into next year just trying to fine tune a little bit of the assumptions ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah so just to revisit right were talking about of our deposit book thats not indexed or dda so on this book the prevailing rates on our
