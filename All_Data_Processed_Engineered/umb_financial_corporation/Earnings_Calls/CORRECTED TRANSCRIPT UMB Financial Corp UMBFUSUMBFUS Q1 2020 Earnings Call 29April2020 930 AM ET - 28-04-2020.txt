investorrelationsumbcom now ill turn the call over to mariner kemper mariner kemper chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thank you kay and thanks everyone for joining us today i hope you and all your family and friends are safe and healthy our thoughts are with the most impacted by this pandemic and our deepest gratitude goes to those on the frontlines including healthcare workers and first responders im going to go off script a bit this morning like everyone on this call ive had a great deal of time over the last days to think and prepare for what lies ahead in my years at umb of those as ceo ive primarily been a risk manager ive come to believe a few simple truths about what were likely to experience over the next couple of years i believe that cecl is the worst designed accounting rule in us history poorly timed and horribly mismanaged by fasb and the accounting industry if we were to return to the incurred loss model investors would have a much easier time understanding the underlying risk at any particular bank but thats not a reality and with cecl now deployed it will nearly be impossible to understand the actual risk that exists in a banks portfolio however the unintended consequence of this should be that were all more prepared for the unknown risks ahead what i do know is that its better to be prepared for the worst rather than only preparing for outcomes that would be better with all that as a backdrop ill share with you the three most important things to focus on as we look at what lies ahead first capital and liquidity are king none of us has any idea how bad this crisis will be no matter what any selfproclaimed genius will tell you and you cant have enough capital or liquidity right now second doing whats right actually matters not only because it feels good but it builds franchise value by bonding both employees and our customers to umb were laserfocused on helping our associates and customers manage through these very difficult times more on that in my prepared comments and lastly and importantly to you our investors our primary mission is to make sure that our current investors can count on us to be standing strong at the end of this crisis and benefit alongside us when we take advantage of the opportunities that will sure present themselves in recovery and only to those of us who are not too badly wounded to capitalize on it heres where our track record as lenders comes into play i cant make any promises about how well perform during this situation but what i can tell you is that i will treat the money that we lend out as my own it happens to be the only investment i have i along with most of our loan committee have been overseeing our lending activities together for years its easy to look good when things are good the real test of credit quality is how it performs when conditions are negative we have a track record on that issue we outperformed nearly every bank in the crisis in conclusion umb is always preparing for the worst we have strong capital levels and a very strong liquidity position along with the loantodeposit ratio that allows us to be there for our customers weve demonstrated to our customers and employees that we put them first and lastly most importantly we have a credit team that is battletested with superior results when it matters in times of crisis now ill return to the comments that we prepared this quarters release and investor call are certainly not routine our focus today is less on quarterly results and more on how were responding to protect and support our umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 associates customers and communities along with details on our portfolio and how were positioned to operate through this crisis we came into this crisis in good position with healthy capital levels and a balance sheet that gives us flexibility while we dont know how long this current environment will last we are prepared and in true to our style we have taken a conservative stance with our positioning first id like to share some of the actions weve taken in light of the rapidly changing environment operationally we activated our business continuity plans on march and took steps to protect our associates and customers umb was one of the first in our region to move to drivethrough only service in our branches and we were able to quickly transition much of our team to remote work model we put additional safety practices in place as well as adding supplemental compensation and additional ph pto days for roles that cant be performed offsite our technology digital and online banking platforms have performed well and weve been able to continue to serve and support customers on an uninterrupted basis now ill turn to our first quarter results announced yesterday afternoon youll see that on a gaap basis we recorded a net loss of million driven by the impact and adoption of cecl which resulted in significantly higher provision expense based on how the economic models calculate the possibility of future credit losses under the extreme conditions created by the covid19 crisis excluding this impact business and financial results remained strong and demonstrated by a increase in pretax preprovision income to million from a linked quarter todate weve seen our peer group report a median increase of in ptpp income unfortunately the illtimed adoption of cecl methodology during this unprecedented macro environment has resulted in additional volatility at a critical time this has made comparing financial institutions across the banking industry extremely difficult if not impossible given all the subjectivity that has gone into these calculations including the source and date of economic forecasts the industry has spent months creating and testing cecl models but they werent meant to operate with such significant movements in unemployment rates gdp expectations interest rates and economic forecasts especially in such a compressed timeframe arguably not all unemployment rates are created equal while todays rate has now exceeded peak levels seen during the recession different industries are being impacted this time at varying degrees each banks loan portfolio is inherently different and national unemployment rates arent always relevant additionally banks such as umb who have less reliance on consumer lending including credit card and mortgage will likely see their portfolios react differently another consideration is the extraordinary amount of fiscal stimulus that is being injected into addressing this crisis for context during the prior financial crisis when ph unemployment rates jumped from to over a 12quarter period our cumulative losses were only of our balances with over half of that in the card portfolio our performance was the second best in our midsized peer group for comparison credit card balances were of our loans in the crisis compared to just under during this crisis umb has always had a reputation for being responsive consistent and conservative as it relates to credit we are quick to get in front of problems quick to move credits to the watch list but most importantly we have a good track record of keeping rank credits from moving to loss based on our relationships with our clients umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 the cecl methodology makes it more difficult to provision in a way that we feel is appropriate for what we know about the quality of our portfolio weve provided some additional information beginning on slide of our materials and ram will discuss those in more detail shortly aside from the cecl impact our asset quality was strong with net chargeoffs of of average loans our provision of million under cecl equates to times net chargeoffs of million for the first quarter and nearly times the last four quarters average provision and another compelling statistic our reserves to non performing assets which has historically been above peer averages stands at times compared to peer median of times average loans increased on a linked quarter annualized basis on an end of period basis growth was compared to the yearend of ph our top line loan production of million and a net increase in revolving balances of million was partially offset by million of payoffs and paydowns the growth in commercial loans in the first quarter included approximately million in net line draw activity line utilization at march was compared to at year end similar to what weve heard from other banks draw activity has slowed in april as shown on slide in early march we began proactively reaching out to our clients we knew could be more severely impacted by the impending economic crisis our entire business banking customer base largely our practice finance portfolio of dentists doctors and professionals was offered a sixmonth deferral to help them weather the storm through our usual relationship management process weve been working towards customized solutions for other borrowers and including the business banking deferrals i mentioned before we have received requests for modifications on approximately billion of our loan portfolio or about of the book the breakdown of those requests by client type can be found on slide this is similar to the levels reported in industry ph surveys when the sbas paycheck protection plan program opened up we were ready and moved quickly we were able to process and get approved applications for more than billion in funded loans these loans have ranged in size from to million with a median of im extremely proud of how our team stepped up to provide this critical support to our clients and we were ready to step back in with a backlog of another applications when the second phase of the program began on monday now ill turn it over to ram to discuss some of the drivers of our results then ill come back and provide a little more detail on the composition of our loan portfolio ram ram shankar chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thank you mariner ill begin with comments on cecl and the drivers of our increased allowance for credit losses which ph began back on slide on adoption on january our allowance for credit losses increased by or million to million net chargeoffs drove a reduction of million and portfolio changes including loan growth and mix and qualitative changes added million for the economic outlook adjustment of million under the cecl model we used the march moodys baseline economic forecast this brings our total allowance to million at march the reserve build added basis points to allowance to loan coverage which was at quarterend our econometric models are built on regressions and correlations during the prior financial crisis to changes in some of the key economic variables applied to our loan portfolio as we disclosed last quarter some of these key umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 variables considered in our model today include the unemployment rate and treasury rates we have taken a conservative approach to our cecl modeling in light of the volatility and frequent changes in economic expectations especially when you consider the modest atrisk portfolio disclosures that mariner will address shortly approximately twothirds of the increase in our allowance can be attributed to our ci portfolio since the end of the first quarter and subsequent to finalizing our cecl estimate the economic forecasts have deteriorated further than our model inputs including conditions that are materially worse than prior recessionary periods and what most models were built off but weve also seen an unprecedented amount of fiscal stimulus being injected to address the crisis with likely more to come additionally unlike prior recessions this crisis has the potential to correct meaningfully in a very shortened timeframe the direction of our future reserves will depend on more observable trends within our portfolio and loan growth coupled with macroeconomic forecast that will be available at the measurement date at the end of the quarter other factors such as the shape timing and magnitude of the recovery will also play a part in assessing future allowance levels it is important to note that our first quarter provision isnt an indicator of a run rate for the remainder of the year now looking at the quarterly results net interest income of million represents an increase of million from the fourth quarter driven by the annualized growth in average loans and excess liquidity and along with decreased deposit costs total earning asset yields fell basis points to from the linked quarter driven largely by a 23basispoint decline in loan yields interestbearing deposit costs also declined basis points for a beta of as the rate cuts were in march well see this impact more clearly in the second quarter net interest spread increased basis point despite a 150basispoint reduction in shortterm interest rates net interest margin compressed by basis points from the fourth quarter driven almost entirely by the declining benefit of free funds the positive impact from lower interestbearing liabilities was offset by loan yields repricing as stated fee income was million for the quarter and reflected some impacts from the volatile markets including negative market valuation adjustments to a few line items the largest reduction was in companyowned life insurance or coli income which decreased million compared to the fourth quarter additionally derivative income and the valuation of some other investments in our trading inventory were impacted as discussed in our earnings release expenses for the quarter decreased or million compared to the fourth quarter largely related to a million reduction in deferred comp expense the offset to the reduced coli income i mentioned partial offsets included typical and seasonal increases of million in payroll taxes medical insurance and 401k expense in the first quarter additional details on noninterest income and expense can be found on slides through as you analyze our results we continue to maintain strong regulatory capital ratios with the cet1 ratio of based on the adoption of interagency guidance for regulatory capital transition and average tangible common equity to tangible assets of during the quarter we repurchased just over million shares at an average price of through both open market repurchases and an accelerated share repurchase program we have no additional plans for share repurchases at this time other than the completion and the settlement of the asr entered into in early march our tangible book value per share increased to at the end of the quarter up from a year ago for comparison our peers that have reported so far have shown an increase of regulatory capital ratios are shown on slide umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 finally in addition to our lower loantodeposit ratio we have multiple primary and secondary sources of liquidity to support our customers now ill hand it back to mariner to go into the details on our loan book mariner kemper chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks ram a snapshot of our loan composition at the end of the first quarter is shown on slide and we have a breakdown of our commercial portfolios by asset class on the following pages our ci book shown on slide stood at billion at the end of the quarter representing of our total book the portfolio with well diversified by industry our commercial real estate portfolio detail begins on page our total cre portfolio stood at billion at the end of the quarter and approximately is comprised of owner occupied ph and real estate farmland and residential construction the remaining is investment cre where our largest exposures are multifamily industrial properties and office buildings while loantovalue ratios vary by property type the average is youll see the full mix and other detail on slide we have many longterm relationships with sponsors who have managed through prior economic cycles and we are primarily a recourse lender our investment cre portfolio overall is recourse next on slide weve called out our exposure to industries that are viewed as having more exposure to the pandemic with additional detail on how were viewing those we identified the five categories shown then looked at each for specific characteristics or specific credits that we feel comfortable with as well as those which we may think carry more risk if the current environment is prolonged the balances shown in the column labeled potentially more impacted subset are those were monitoring more closely and youll see that amounts to just under of our total loan book i dont think its appropriate to make a blanket statement about a particular industry or category as thats not how we look at our book we know our customers well and have an active dialog with them in all environments we generally have strong sponsors and as i mentioned our cre book is largely recourse ill begin with our oil and gas portfolio and the breakdown by segment is shown on that same slide we had million outstanding at the end of the quarter representing of total loans which has remained steady since the last time oil prices were in focus in and many of our energy clients have been with us for years and weve worked with them through the last cycle we have strong equity sponsors in place for much of the book and many customers are wellhedged against oil price volatility as shown in the table million of the oil and gas portfolio is currently receiving more scrutiny and is comprised of credits in the service sector as those customers are the most impacted in this environment and a few of our upstream credits that are more heavily dependent on oil prices and possibly have less protection in place this brings us to a total in the more impacted column for our oil and gas loans down to of total loans in cre our multifamily and student portfolios student housing portfolios had a combined million outstanding at quarterend of which is for projects under construction that are not expected to come to market within the next six months the largest portion of our multifamily loans are for class a developments we have not yet heard of significant stress but a longer shutdown or deeper recession could obviously impact the professional workforce as well and we are in close communication with our clients umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 this book is recourse and weighted average ltvs are for multifamily and for student housing this brings the total in the more impacted column for multifamily down to of total loans retail cre of million is broadly diversified and a substantial portion carries guarantees from top sponsors is grocery anchored retail centers and less than is for properties that are majority occupied by restaurants this book is recourse and has a weighted average ltv of this brings the total in the more impacted column for retail cre down to of total loans our total hotel portfolio is million representing of total loans and youll see that the portion we currently have under closer scrutiny is million or of loans of our outstanding hotel balances are under construction and again that excludes any that may come to market within six months our entire hotel portfolio is recourse all properties are flagged with major brand families and the majority are limited service hotels versus full service the weighted average loantovalue is and the average debt to service coverage ratio on our stabilized hotel portfolio in was times in our transportation service category the largest portion of the million in balances are truck transportation and warehouse clients and much of that group are leaders in the industry with strong net worth and liquidity we have minimal exposure to passenger travel or tour companies which are less than of total loans after review the more impacted portion of that book is just about of total loans after an indepth analysis the portion of balances in these five categories that we view as being highly impacted represents about of total loan balances of course this isnt any indication that we think those will all be losses but we will continue to keep a close watch as conditions evolve throughout this crisis finally we have a strong capital and liquidity position and a history of prudent risk management and believe our diverse revenue sources help provide a buffer in this interest rate environment weve been through many crises in our 107year history and were proud to work alongside our peer banks to help navigate through this one to wrap up after digesting other banks earnings this season its abundantly clear that there is a great deal of subjectivity that goes into the allowance process more so than ever as youve heard us say our credit management team has been together for a long time with an average tenure of years at umb we take a conservative approach and proactive approach to credit management and remain confident that our credit quality will remain one of our key differentiators especially during periods of stress i want to recognize and thank our team members who continue to go above and beyond every day as we serve our clients it has brought everyone together during a difficult time and it has reinforced what weve always known relationships matter that concludes my prepared remarks and ill turn it over to the conference call operator for the qa portion of the call thanks a lot umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions at this time our first question comes from ebrahim poonawala of bofa bank of america please proceed ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc good morning mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning ebrahim ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning eb ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc so i guess just first on credit so appreciate all the commentary and its twopart question one just from a quantitative perspective on slide you mentioned reserve levels at basis points of projected loss under stress scenario and weve seen all sorts of ranges there in terms of banks have been at up to that just talk to us in terms of the depth of downturn or economic pain assumed in that loss scenario and is it safe to conclude that unless we see the macro outlook deteriorate you should be done with the reserve building part of this mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah ram why dont you take that it sounds like a modeling mostly a modeling question ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp hey good morning ebrahim so weve seen some of the peer data on that same metric and i cant speak for others in terms of our coverage of dfast losses first thing dfast and cecl are two different tracks they are completely for two different purposes right obviously dfast is a ninequarter outlook versus the life of the loan contract but ill go back to what i said in the script and mariner mentioned this too we have taken a pretty conservative approach based on the volatility that we saw at measurement date of march 27th in the moodys economic forecast looking ahead so those are considered in we didnt lay any negative overlays on what the model output was in terms of some of the stimulus programs that are out there and how shallow this recession could potentially be so this is pretty much a straightup model exercise in terms of how we approach cecl with it and then theres the dfast which is as i said completely different ball game ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 got it and i guess so understood so you didnt assume any lower losses relative to what the models ph pick out to account for the stimulus actions if i heard you correctly ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp and the stimulus actions and all the things that mariner just walked us through ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc right ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp in terms of the atrisk portfolios right within the atrisk portfolios that people have generally labeled theres only half of that we think we need to monitor a little bit more closely because we have recourse and we have a lot of different things that can protect us so thats not fully taken into account either mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i think also ebrahim it sounds a little bit like your question is what about the second quarter and i think its early to try to give you too much color about what will happen in the second quarter but what has come clear to us as it relates to how cecl was applied by all the different banks is that there were many many qualitative overlays put on by a lot of the banks and as we stare into the second quarter being as conservative as we were we do believe if data were to get worse unemployment were to get worse that we sort of bought our way into the second quarter at some level by being conservative in the first quarter we do plan on doing deep analysis on the second quarter against what the unemployment rate will be what the stimulus is how to apply unemployment against different parts of our book so we will continue to apply qualitative analysis as we roll into the second and third quarter ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc got it and i guess just a minor following up so you mentioned the difference in the portfolio credit card loans much smaller ph they were the big driver of losses last cycle i guess the other side this youve the bank a lot in terms of commercial lending a lot of that has been cre and ci out of market just talk to us in terms of your level of confidence going into this cycle relative to ph your ceo going into the last cycle and just in terms of your borrower base your confidence in the customer credit quality mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah great question first of all you made one statement about out of market we have very little way of out of market so thats not you got that misunderstood that a bit about our portfolio so most of our loans are ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc i guess i meant out of the legacy markets so expansionary markets be texas denver et cetera umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp okay well i mean again i mean weve been in denver since so i dont know that i would call any of our markets particularly expansion markets other than i suppose texas is under years but we were lending in texas before we opened the offices there so anyway i think really what weve talked about before about our loan growth is as youll recall about years ago we went through an exercise right to penetrate the markets that were in by doing a few things that are independent of taking more risks ie creating the verticals right so we were generalists years ago and we hired marketing people and went to conferences and created marketing material and special pricing that helped us compete in particular segments and verticals and then we invested in staff in the markets that we were didnt have as much exposure in and we also changed our compensation practices years ago to pursue and help our teams pursue so i think the biggest thing i would say as weve been saying for some time is we were underpenetrated and a big part of our outsized growth was and continues to be being underpenetrated in the markets that were in and just getting our piece of the market share so we are not we in order to go from the growth rates we had years ago to the ones were having now the only difference really is the things i mentioned we havent changed our credit underwriting its the same team as i said before so were underwriting the same way weve awakened our marketing capabilities and our sales capabilities over the last decade to pursue whats rightfully ours from a market share perspective we have really low market share in all the markets that were in so weve called that a runway for some time on these calls we have a really long runway to penetrate without taking any additional risks and on the cre side as we talked at great depth about how we do that were a recourse lender we pay attention to sponsors and global liquidity and things like that so i feel very comfortable and i would say the biggest thing i would say is there really isnt anything different that weve been doing im the same ceo i was years ago when i took the job and ive been overseeing credit over that entire years tom terry whos our chief credit officer is years on the job and jim rine is years on the job so and thats just three of us but the so thats what id say about it like i said in my prepared comments i cant promise anything but what i can tell you is that were very consistent ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc understood and just separately if i could ram in terms of the margin i understand theres a lot of volatility but if the rate environment stays the way it is whats your sense in terms of the cadence of margin compression from this point on and do we see stabilization at a higher level relative to where we were when rates were zero back in ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah as you said ebrahim a lot of moving parts with margin looking ahead one of the disclosures that we have is the amount of ppp loans for instance we did so weve done up to this point billion and as you know those fees will get amortized over a 24month period until a large portion of these loans will pay off or be forgiven or just mature right at which point all these ph fees will be amortized so that can be a big impact to our third and fourth quarter results in terms of how the margin progresses but if you exclude ppp one of the things weve been really successful both on the asset side and the liability side of the equation is instituting loan floors in a majority of our new production and then as the ph back book comes up for renewals weve umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 been able to be very successful in that as well and you saw this quarter were also very prudent with our deposit pricing our cost of deposits in march alone was basis points lower than where deposits were so were taking a pretty good look at where deposit costs need to be so well use up our excess liquidity that should be favorable to margin as well and then the other side is whats happening with libor one month libor was at basis points or so at march and its now retreated down to about basis points and as you know some of these are some of our loans are indexed to one month libor but as i said earlier as these loans come up for renewals we are pretty successful at flooring some of these rates and then the last point ill make is just to buy yields on our portfolio given where the 10year is at less than basis points thats ph slipped a little bit you see the rolloff yield on one of the pages its about ph were getting slightly lower than that between a mix of mortgagebacked securities and muni bonds so the final point ill make is net interest spread as you saw this quarter is going to be pretty stable the benefit of free funds and what happens to the value of our dda balances which are 30plus percent of our ph book its thats where we see the lower benefit going forward ph another long answer to say nothing but im not we dont give typical margin guidance mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah i think i think ram mentioned there in there that obviously a big part of our deposit repricing happened in late march so a lot of that positive impact well see in the second quarter ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks eb operator our next question comes from john rodis of fig partners john please proceed john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc good morning everybody hope youre all doing well mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hey john how are you john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc not too bad not too bad interesting times for sure appreciate all the detail maybe ram maybe just i guess a modeling question as far as the share count goes you said in the press release that you still have i guess youll umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 complete the asr in the second quarter so how does the share count change from the end of march to june i guess ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp so the way the asr works is of the million through the asr has already been retired or put in treasury stock so the the brokerdealer just holds back for any volatility in stock price so the could be another  from where march ended john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay so not a big difference but ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp no john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc and then aside from that the buyback is on hold is that correct mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp correct john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc you mentioned the ppp loan program what is sort of the average fee that we should expect i assume its probably in the to range but can you narrow it down mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp ram indiscernible ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp well yeah ill get that so based on the profile weve seen and what we disclosed the average loan size is about and right now were trending closer to ph on the loan origination fee and thats gross obviously the other thing that well factor in is the funding cost we could avail of the ppp lending facility which funds this loans at basis points and then theres any costs incremental and marginal costs that are associated with the program whether its legal regulatory new system that we purchased to enable this to be umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 able to serve our customers very well so those are kind of the moving parts on the economics of the ppp program john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah john just as a reminder too this is really a service were providing we dont really see this as something were making any money on at all this is a government program were an agent and if we cover our costs at the end of this thing ill be surprised john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc no listen i understand its obviously extraordinary times so you i mean the banks are part of the solution this time around mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc two other questions for me guys just i guess just one your comment your thoughts as far as the loan pipeline going forward obviously the first quarter was very strong but i would think things have slowed pretty dramatically and then just one other question or just if you could address the other question was on service charges you saw a bumpup related to healthcare and just your thoughts as far as that going forward or is that more sort of onetime mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah ill take the this is mariner ill take the first question and then im going to turn that second over to jim rine the first question about the pipeline we have a pretty long history of giving you our investors on these calls a look into the upcoming quarter and then thats about as much forwardlooking as we are able and willing to give and so the second quarter looks based on the pipeline to be as strong as the first quarter or thereabouts and so it looks to be a solid second quarter i have no idea what third and fourth quarter will be given kind of the conditions and the inability to kind of get out and play golf and have lunch or a cup of coffee with a prospective borrower so those that i imagine in the third and fourth quarter if things dont open up significantly would slow some but the second quarter looks pretty good and john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc mariner so umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc im sorry so you so the pipeline is strong would you sort of assume though that the pullthrough rate would be lower just given everything thats going on mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp no the way we do our pipeline for you guys is its the thats a pretty strong indication of things that are going to be accepted and booked so we expect the second quarter to be pretty strong like the first quarter john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay thank you mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah theres no guarantees indiscernible mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp no guarantees of course right but the john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc i fully understand mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah and then john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc ph go ahead mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp and then second question about fees ive had jim rine our ceo of the bank ph who is prepared those businesses roll to him time he can give you a little color on the fees umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp so on healthcare you saw a spike in the service charges and that was related to one relationship that we still have the deposits and the business that was transferring the actual custodial relationship on the accounts the deposit still are growing in our healthcare space the pandemic ph it still remains to be seen as far as how it will impact the industry in general but the high deductible plans should become much more in favor as employers look to continue to reduce costs going forward so were well right now we dont see the full impact of how things will play out through the course of the year we did see some of the card activity reduce also in march but we will know more in the next few months how the rest of the year plays out there john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay so the move over though from that one relationship is sort of a onetime item i guess james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp it was mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp it was onetime and we continue to maintain those deposits john rodis q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay super thank you everybody be safe mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah you too thanks ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks john operator our next question comes from david long of raymond james david please proceed david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp hey david good morning david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc the first question i have relates to the large commercial customer you talked about that cost an increase in your nonaccruals can you talk about maybe what industry that was or what changed with that relationship or if theres anything else you can disclose that caused that move mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp sure its actually two relationships that caused that move and i think ill just point you back for a moment just kind of the way nonperformings and criticized credits work at umb we have a long history of sort of seeing some volatility on that and the reason for that is the way we operate which is we are very quick to take action and recognize problems and work them we have a pretty long great track record of doing so and what is if you take a look at our long the chart from criticize to doubtful or loss youll see that the migration from nonperforming or criticized to loss is de minimis and so again i guess what i would just point you to is from timetotime youll see two or three credits that end up in that nonperforming category that cause a spike to those numbers but typically thats just because were working were identifying them early and working them early for a solution and in this particular case theres two credits one in the energy space and one in the ag space the one in the ag space we feel like we have adequate collateral coverage to bring us home the one in the energy space we have already reserved for what we believe to be today believe to be the exposure on that one and so i think youll over time see our number come back down into its averages so thats the high level of what has impacted that and how were thinking about those two credits david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thank you and then my second question relates to your trust and securities processing line is that more driven by market values transactions volumes or a mix there and then what type of trends have you seen in that business mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hey jim why dont you take that ive got some good news there to share and then of course market impact is definitely a part of it james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 yeah so the fees in that business its twofold some is market action but weve had nice backlog in that business in our wealth management business the new business from new customers has been up over  and the growth in aum from new customers is up and the fund services business weve had continue to convert new customers and weve seen strong growth on that and so we feel very good about where were positioned but as far as the decline in the market we were off ph the market and equities were off roughly we were only off roughly in portfolio values so werent seeing the declines like the our declines didnt mirror the actual market and some of the fees are tied to the actual market returns but some obviously are more flat fee as well so theres a mix there but the business has continued to grow weve invested in it we have a new platform being brought on for the private wealth management space this year that will allow us to hold additional alternative investments on that platform and be a better experience for our clients so a lot going on in that space but weve continued to invest and we havent cut back on the projects related to growing the business regarding that space david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc excellent appreciate the color thanks guys mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp thanks david operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty of kbw chris please proceed christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great good morning everybody mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp good morning ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp hey chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc well maybe just a modeling question for you on the expenses understanding the offsets on the coli that ran through both fees and expenses but if i adjust for that million and then also the seasonal i think youd call out million of seasonal expenses is that the right way to kind of think about where expenses could be near term understanding you may pull back on some costs given restrictions on travel and marketing mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 you got this ram go ahead ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah generally yeah thats the million is seasonal expenses and you just heard jim rine talk about it in this environment we havent really scaled back any of the investments from that standpoint right were continuing our path on that one so you should see some inflation related to that but at the same time as weve always said well be really watchful of some of those discretionary items the lockdown is creating some of those synergy opportunities just from a travel and entertainment and marketing perspective so well watch our expenses from that standpoint christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah we should definitely continue to outperform there as both the lockdown conditions persist as well as we continue through this environment learn that we can continue to be more efficient in the way were operating christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp and then of course in the disclosures we also have some of the expenses that we track related to the covid crisis and in the first quarter we had or so or less of that some of the programs that mariner talked about whether its the supplemental pay or just in terms of our readiness and preparedness for covid you can see some of that impact our expense line but again it depends on how long this lasts so those will impact our expense trajectory as well christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and just a couple of small ones the disclosures were great in the deck the reserve ratios were getting some questions just for banks on specific of those portfolios that you deem somewhat higher risk do you have the reserve that you have set aside on both the hotel and the energy portfolio ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp the energy book we have a qualitative reserve of about million which is of that book the hotel i dont know if i know the answer chris specifically christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp on hotel book but again you go back to the disclosures yeah and what mariner talked about even on the hotel book you whittle it down and you take out recourse its a very small part of our exposure there mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc understood mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah its been my perception as i sort of look at all of the other announcements coming out that theyve been sort of standard account its been kind of a standard accounting exercise a bit of a lazy exercise if you will to me just sort of taking the whole book saying oh okay everybodys interested in hotels so heres our hotel book boom done so we took some extra effort to actually show you what we actually are worried about because it isnt i dont think the right approach just to take the whole book and say its at risk because thats just not true so that was really what we did was instead of just kind of doing a blanket simple accounting exercise and just showing you what we had in each category we broke it down to tell you what we worry about and then how we think about where the real risk is and thats in those two columns to the right on page where we talk about reasons reasons for excluding and then the farther column to the right are just additional comments as to why we may or may not worry about something that is even still on that list so just because its on that list doesnt mean we think were going to take a loss because hey its also got liquid sponsors on there or for example doesnt come to market within the next six months so something we can readdress later six months from now depending on where we are christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc that level of disclosure was helpful i appreciate it mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc maybe the last one ram could you help us on the effective tax rate going forward ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 its tough because of all the volatility in earnings and the percentage of taxfree income ph as it related to pretax so my best guess chris at this point would be closer to christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc is that fte or is that nonfte sorry ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp no yeah ph etr christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hey chris i might add to i think it might be interesting for everybody to know on oil and gas because everyone is concerned about that as we are that remains about the same percent of the book as it was during the energy pricing crisis and ph its generally the same clients that are in that book for us of it is service which is really where most of the concern would be the great majority ph the rest has hedges on it and on the service side the customers that we ranked and worried about during the last cycle are the same customers this cycle and the sponsors in those credits stepped up during the last cycle so we have great confidence really in the ones that remain in that book because of the same people who stepped up behind the credits during the last crisis christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for the color mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks chris operator operator instructions our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala bank of america please proceed ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 hey eb ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc just a followup maybe mariner or jim and it might be a tough one to answer but i was wondering if youve seen any improvement in customer sentiment activity through the course of the last month means everything obviously shut down in a big way in the middle of march im just wondering ph if things have kind of steadied in the last few weeks if there are any kind of green shoots or any pickup in activity that youve noticed that might be worth calling out mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp there the one thing i would point you to is just line utilization so as the crisis started do unfold we went from to in utilization and if this is any indication of sentiment that has dropped back down to as we sit here today so that is some indication maybe of how the customers feel i would say just generally anecdotally as we speak to our clients and ill let maybe tom ph pipe in here for a second i think everyone is still nervous and cautious so i dont see anybody really reacting as if they see light at the end of the tunnel right now it would be my take and ill let tom add to that thomas s terry a chief lending officer umb financial corp ph look mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i think just its in general theres a in my opinion and i think our customers would share that with a theres a long row to hoe here and i dont think theres much of a sentiment change you want to add to that tom thomas s terry a chief lending officer umb financial corp no i think you said it just right i think theres a wait and see attitude and i think we have a very patient client base and i think people are going to walk before they run certainly before they start borrowing and expanding too quickly mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i would just add as i think you already know just about how we lend our borrowers are in general on the stronger end of things theyve got better balance sheets and liquidity and thats sort of how what kind of lender that we are so we have borrowers generally speaking that always operate ph as if things can get worse and thats the right way to think about things ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc ph all right thank you umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 james rine a president chief executive officerumb bank na umb financial corp and ebrahim this is jim rine we also have a lot of borrowers that are also essential businesses that are still active that are quite busy that are also going through the motions of employing safe workspaces while going about construction contracts and things like that while theyre busy theyre certainly experiencing the new normal they have an experience theyve experienced some delays in projects but not outright cancellations yet so it really is a mixed bag which isnt the exact answer you would be looking for but im sure thats the consistent answer that youre hearing from others mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp i also think you you didnt really ask it this way but ill offer it as it relates to just how this thing is unfolding i dont believe so what we theres a lot of conversation about when we go back and what that looks like to me going back is going to be a very very slow ride you think you hear what texas is doing is theyre calling it a complete open but at capacity so i think until we have a vaccine things are going to when they do open and we call things open broadly its going to look a lot more like texas than its going to look like what we left behind in february so i think the road is long and hard even when we come out because coming out doesnt mean capacity it means capacity thats my personal opinion until we have a vaccine ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america securities inc appreciate the perspective thank you operator our next question comes from jared shaw wells fargo jared please proceed mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp hey jared timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning this is actually timur braziler filling in for jared ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp hey timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc just a couple of questions remain here looking at slide the in process modifications is the composition of that million is that any different from the existing modifications or is it pretty similar mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp you want to ask that again im sorry umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc so for the million of in process modifications mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc slide im just ph wondering if the industries those are in are similar to the existing modifications or if thats skewed to any particular industry mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp no theres nothing theres no skewing going on there ph were just yeah id also just might add that in my opinion on modifications and forbearance in general i dont know exactly how the investor population is thinking about it but it feels like its something you all are looking for to see if what existing problems might exist and the color i would give you is that really at least for umb modifications and forbearance really is forwardlooking and reliefbased to help people avoid problems rather than a recognition of existing problems timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful and just in terms of clients seeking modifications has that also slowed similar to the utilization rates or that is still fairly similar ph to the quarterend mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp tom do you have any color on that thomas s terry a chief lending officer umb financial corp yeah it has slowed we had quite a few right out of the gate i think ppp maybe caught some peoples attention you talk to some of the other chief credit officers in various meetings there are some feeling that certainly the longer this goes if it goes past may or past june in terms of how long it takes for the economy to come back there may be another wave we havent seen that yet mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah and by the way my comments a moment ago is to clear them up about the or comeback that would be i was thinking more along those lines as service not gdp like the utilization of what restaurant activity and concerts and such and things like that not so much gdp so just a clarification timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 and then just one last one for me maybe a big picture question as it relates to cecl methodology do you actually need to see an improvement in the gdp and in unemployment rates or is there enough qualitative overlay where you can preemptively begin to lower reserve levels in advance of those metrics actually coming down ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp this is ram its a little bit early to talk about it but if you look at the moodys forecast and we have a little synopsis of what the forecast entails right so it has unemployment rate peaking to an average of at least as of the march 27th forecast and then coming down back to a level so that kind of recovery is already built into how we modeled it and we would call it maybe a bathtub u recovery as opposed to any kind of v recovery thats not what were assuming in terms of unemployment getting back to normal whatever the new normal would be mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp but so to echo or one extra layer there on rams comments if that were the case thats the answer to your question but then the flipside is obviously if moodys changes its forecast in the second quarter to match something more like what jpmorgan is taking about with a unemployment and a reduction if that type of thing were to take hold into the moodys forecast that we would have to react to that and thats where then you start assessing what you think the trillion in stimulus has from a qualitative perspective we start doing qualitative overlays related to how unemployment specifically impacts different categories within our book and how we feel about how national data plays into our book in the middle part of the country and those types of things that we would overlay timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah thats good color thank you ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp thanks indiscernible operator operator instructions our next question will come from nathan race of piper sandler nathan please proceed nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co hi everyone good morning ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp good morning ph nate nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 mariner has answered my first question just on the oil and gas book in terms of how that portfolio has changed in both size and client composition since the downturn but i guess im just curious if you guys have a sense or when you look back at that period what ph ultimate loss content looks like across that portfolio mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp we had very little losses in it its actually weve ranked the credits and worried about them but ultimately had very little in the way of losses nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then just going back to the ppp loans that you guys had funded any sense for that billion billion that youve funded how much of that has actually been kind of geared towards those clients that you guys outlined on that slide that have been more so impacted mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp we dont i dont think we have an overlay to get into that with you to match those two up so i dont think we have that level of detail tom thomas s terry a chief lending officer umb financial corp we dont mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just a couple of housekeeping questions ram the securities book came up a little bit in the quarter obviously you guys had good seasonal deposit growth as well just any sense of how that securities portfolio is going to trend over the next few quarters obviously with the ppp loans indiscernible balance sheet and so forth and just how those how you expect those to be ph up thomas s terry a chief lending officer umb financial corp i would say yeah nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co ph go ahead umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 thomas s terry a chief lending officer umb financial corp i would say consistent with current levels obviously every month were evaluating whether we want to reinvest in this market as ive said earlier the rollonrolloff yields on the securities book especially the mortgagebacked securities book has ph flipped so were going to be very cautious about reinvesting and at the end of the day we might have excess liquidity because at some point we do anticipate and were seeing the halo effect of excess liquidity that we did see through the last crisis from a deposit standpoint so at some point well have excess liquidity that we might have to deploy between these and mortgagebacked securities that ph as we as i look for the next quarter or two i would keep it consistent with where its been mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp yeah we have definitely as we did in the last crisis seen some flighttosafety deposit gathering activity for sure and expect to continue to feel that and in particular without naming any banks but some of the missteps that have taken place in the industry as it relates to how ppp rolled out we have were seeing some benefit from that as we were early and took action and started adding noncustomers to that pipeline as they were not being served in other places so i think were going to continue to see some of that flighttosafety flighttoquality deposit building and deposit gathering activity nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it makes sense and if i could just ask one more just within expenses and i know you guys dont give guidance but marketing was down pretty substantially sequentially and then during you guys obviously had a ramp in legal and consulting fees so just any sense for how those line items could trend this year it sounds like you guys have some delays in the timing of some projects and so forth so just trying to put in that context in terms of the run rate of those items mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp go ahead ram ram shankar a chief financial officer executive vice president umb financial corp yeah so you can see that its consistent with what the last first quarter was so theres always a seasonal drop off in the first quarter we did accelerate some of the spending for concepts in the fourth quarter so thats why its a little bit higher than usual as well but as i said earlier thats one of the discretionary items that we will consider as we look at our expenses obviously in a lockdown some of the things that roll up into that line item are travel and entertainment and sponsorships and things like that so to the extent those dont happen you might see those trending lower but once you come out of the crisis indiscernible go back on the customer acquisition side and start to market for both the consumer and card portfolios specifically nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay got it very helpful i appreciate you guys taking questions thank you umb financial corp umbf corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2020 mariner kemper a chairman president chief executive officer umb financial corp sure ram shankar a chief
