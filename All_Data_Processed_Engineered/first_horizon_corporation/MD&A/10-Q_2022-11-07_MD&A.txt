securities inventory continuously throughout each trading day accordingly fhnfs trading securities inventory is highly dynamic rather than static as a result it would be rare for fhnf to incur a negative revenue day in its fixed income activities at the levels indicated by its var measures in addition to being used in fhns daily market risk management process the var and svar measures are also used by fhn in computing its regulatory market risk capital requirements in accordance with the market risk capital rules for additional information regarding fhns capital adequacy refer to the capital section of this mda fhn also performs stress tests on its trading securities portfolio to calculate the potential loss under various assumed market scenarios key assumed stresses used in those tests are down bps assumes an instantaneous downward move in interest rates of basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve up bps assumes an instantaneous upward move in interest rates of basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve curve flattening assumes an instantaneous flattening of the interest rate yield curve through an increase in shortterm rates and a decrease in longterm rates the 2year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to increase basis points and the 10year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease basis points shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2year and 10year points curve steepening assumes an instantaneous steepening of the interest rate yield curve through a decrease in shortterm rates and an increase in longterm rates the 2year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease basis points and the 10year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to increase basis points shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2year and 10year points credit spread widening assumes an instantaneous increase in credit spreads the difference between yields on treasury securities and nontreasury securities of basis points model validation trading risk management personnel within fhn financial have

but only on a preliminary basis they may not be fully known for some time inflation recession and federal reserve policy economic overview the year to date has been marked by strong inflation which began in the federal reserve implementing a tightening policy to contain inflation by increasing shortterm interest rates and ending asset purchases many indicators suggesting nearterm recession continuing supplychain difficulties impacting many industries and low unemployment rates historically while it is common for unemployment to rise only after a recession has begun it is unusual for unemployment to remain low in the context of the events in so far the delayed reaction is likely to be temporary however if recessionary pressures continue to grow demand for labor eventually will abate amplifying inflationary pressures and general uncertainties this year the russian military invaded ukraine in february much of europe and the rest of the world including the us has imposed economic sanctions on russia for its attack its ongoing military campaign resulting in substantial civilian casualties and the manner in which it has prosecuted the war which reportedly has significantly violated several international conventions and treaties the war and sanctions resulted in global oil and gas prices rising precipitously in early along with the prices of several other commodities exported by russia ukraine or both including certain grains and vegetable oils the onset of winter in europe is expected to exacerbate shortages of oil natural gas and other heating fuels federal reserve and rates the federal reserve has raised shortterm rates several times already this year and recent public comments indicate that further raises will continue until inflation is judged to be adequately controlled the last four raises have been basis points each which is aggressive by historical standards moreover the federal reserve has expressed its intent to bring inflation under control even at the risk of creating or deepening an economic recession by raising rates the federal reserve intends to curb demand in the us for goods and services by making credit more expensive and reducing the amount of borrowed dollars generally if supplies remain constant curbing demand should curb inflation eventually fhn cannot predict exactly when or how much shortterm rates will be raised nor how marketdriven longterm rates will behave nor how those actions may affect financial markets during the remainder of and continuing into however currently fhn expects the federal reserve to adhere to its guidance and continue raising shortterm rates yield curve during the yield curve flattened and modestly inverted at times in the first two quarters and was inverted most of the third quarter unusual yield curve effects including inversion may continue a traditional measure of inversion occurs when the twoyear us treasury rate is higher than the tenyear rate traditional inversion was sustained for most of the third quarter continuing into the fourth sustained traditional yield curve inversion is viewed with statistical support as a harbinger of economic recession recession the us economy contracted experienced negative growth during the first and second quarters this year those first two contractions were modest but in each case contrary to official expectations the us economy grew modestly in the third quarter buoyed in part by a disproportionate falloff in demand for imported goods versus domestic goods although thirdquarter us growth was a positive development and the inflation rate no longer is rising inflation in the us remains persistently high and therefore recessionary expectations in the us remain high as well traditionally though not officially two consecutive quarters of contraction indicates the start of a recession official designations of the beginning and end of a recessionary period are based on extensive data analysis and take many months to be announced currently no recession has been officially declared however recession expectations in the us have been growing all year when people and businesses expect a recession they often change their behaviors in ways that make recession more likely they borrow less spend less and invest less market volatility as a result of the prospects for recession coupled with the uncertainties associated with the war in eastern europe financial markets worldwide have been volatile in financial asset values broadly fell this year especially during the second and third quarters in the us several major stock indices have fallen more than from their most recent high levels which conventionally means those indices entered a bear market impacts on fhn in several respects fhn has benefited significantly from rising rates fhn is likely to continue to benefit as long as the rise in lending rates outpaces the rise in deposit and other funding rates however some of fhns businesses have been

fall substantially compared with moreover fhns revenues from bond trading and related activities have fallen significantly in due to rising rates coupled with elevated market volatility more generally a recession with stillrising rates likely would have a significant negative impact on fhns businesses overall even if loan spreads continue to widen demand for loans is likely to fall reserves for loan losses are likely to rise many commercial activities that generate fee income are likely to decline and competition for clients is likely to sharpen fhn already has experienced some of these impacts the deeper or longer a recession lasts the more significant these negative impacts are likely to be for fhn complicating the economic situation in the us this year is the impact that federal reserve policy has had on the value of the us dollar versus many other major currencies the dollar has risen substantially in resulting in pressure on us exports which are relatively more expensive a windfall for imports into the us which are relatively cheaper and pressure on nonus borrowers of us dollars and international buyers of goods traded mainly using us dollars although fhn is not directly and significantly impacted by those effects some clients have been and will continue to be moreover other central banks have been pressured to follow the lead of the federal reserve to support their respective currencies as in the us those tightening actions dampen economic activity and increase the risk of recession in those countries libor reference rate reform libor the london interbank offered rate libor for many years was the most widely used reference rate in the world a large but declining portion of fhns floating rate loans use libor denominated in us dollars usd as the reference rate to determine the interest rate paid by the clientborrower in addition certain floatingrate securities issued by fhn use usd libor as the reference rate libor is based on a mix of transactionbased data and expert judgment about market conditions it is published in different tenors which are time periods such as 1week 1month 12month etc libor discontinuance about a decade ago evidence emerged that some members of the panel that set libor may have manipulated the published libor rates rather than using strictly goodfaith judgments several banks were fined in the chief executive of the united kingdom financial conduct authority the fcathe governmental regulator of liborannounced that it intended to halt persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after in the fca announced that tenors of usd libor would no longer be published as follows one week and 2month usd libor would not be published after december and all other usd libor tenors eg overnight 1month 3month 6month and 12month tenors would not be published after june us regulatory position in the federal reserve the occ and the fdic jointly encouraged us banks to transition away from libor for new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by december they noted that entering into new contracts that use libor as a reference rate after december would create safety and soundness risks us federal legislation in march congress passed the adjustable interest rate libor act the legislation addresses loans that will remain on libor as of the june cessation date and that either have no fallback provisions or that contain fallback provisions that do not identify a specific benchmark replacement per the legislation at the final cessation of usd libor banks may cause such loans to fall back to a sofrbased benchmark rate with such rate to be selected by the federal reserve board the libor act also provides safe harbor from liability for banks that select the boardselected replacement benchmark rate at the cessation of libor alternatives to libor libor became the marketpreferred reference rate because it was perceived by lenders and borrowers as being superior to alternatives in a wide range of circumstances now that the origination of liborindexed loans has ended no single alternative reference rate has replaced libor for usd transactions instead a number of different reference rates are being used in different circumstances these include daily sofr the alternative reference rates committee arrc is a group of privatemarket 3q22 form 10q report part i item managements discussion analysis mda and financial regulator participants convened by the federal reserve and the new york federal reserve bank to help ensure a successful transition from usd libor to a more robust reference rate the arrc has recommended the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its preferred alternative sofr resets daily and is based on actual transaction data for the us treasury repurchase market accordingly sofr represents a nearly riskfree secured overnight rate cme term sofr published by cme group term sofr is a forwardlooking rate with 1month 3month 6month and 12month tenors and is based on sofr futures contracts the arrc recommended conventions for term sofr rates recommended cme group as the administrator for term sofr and in july formally recommended cme groups term sofr rates ameribor the american interbank offered rate ameribor index is produced by the american financial exchange ameribor is based on actual transaction data involving credit decisions by many financial institutions on an unsecured basis bsby the bloomberg shortterm bank yield index bsby is a proprietary rate index calculated and published by bloomberg index services limited bsby is based on actual transaction data involving unsecured credit prime although traditional prime rates with each bank setting its own are not likely to regain the prominence they had decades ago when us banks were much smaller and the industry was more fragmented for some clients and products banks may increase their usage of prime rates the alternatives listed above were made available to the majority of fhns commercial clients starting in november in accordance with the us regulatory position fhn ceased entering into new libor based contracts as of december each alternative reference rate has advantages and disadvantages compared with other alternatives in various circumstances despite being supported by the arrc daily sofr has not gained significant traction among middle market commercial borrowers when assessing daily sofr some borrowers have observed that the adoption of a rate with a daily reset introduces operational complexities including changes to the loans interest calculation and billing cycle by contrast cme term sofr is a rate that like libor has rate reset tenors of monthly or longer and like daily sofr carries the endorsement of the arrc for these reasons cme term sofr has gained traction among many middle market commercial borrowers all of the alternative reference rates selected by fhn to date meet the international organization of securities commissions iosco principles for financial benchmarks as affirmed by the rate administrator andor an independent auditor while banking regulators have stated that banks are free to choose the index rates they offer clients some public sector officials have urged caution in using the new credit sensitive alternative reference rates a category that includes bsby and ameribor primarily due to the robustness of underlying data used to derive the rates more specifically there is concern of an inverted pyramid effect where a large number of financial contracts could be priced using an index derived from a relatively low volume of transactions in an interagency statement on october us banking regulatory agencies noted that supervised institutions should understand how their chosen reference rate is constructed and be aware of any fragilities associated with that rate and the markets that underlie it iosco has also warned of the potential for the inverted pyramid problem and will monitor how the iosco label is used by administrators fhn is monitoring the credit sensitive reference rates and regulatory guidance around use of such rates fhn plans to limit use of credit sensitive rates to commercial loans approximately of global usd libor market and related customer swaps pending development of derivatives markets for these rates additionally fhn expects that each financial contract will contain fallback language to guide transition from a credit sensitive rate to an alternative should that action be deemed necessary in the future fhns actions to date transition plans starting in fhn modernized the fallback language used in its loan documentation to better handle how floating rate loans would be reset if libor ceased to be published during the loan term in the fourth quarter of fhn ceased using usd libor for new lending and renegotiated terms with clients whose loans are based on 1week or 2month usd libor which ceased publication at the end of only a small portion of fhns clients had such loans on the consumer side fhn began transitioning from liborbased adjustable rate mortgages arms to sofrbased arms in november and no longer offers liborbased arms sofr has emerged as a market standard for arms in the us and is the conforming convention for fannie mae and freddie mac for all products fhn developed a gotomarket strategy which included pricing considerations associate training and client communications all required systems processes and reporting were updated to accommodate the transition fhn ceased origination of new contracts tied to libor on december in addition fhn has established a libor transition office to assist associates in working with their clients to renegotiate terms of loan and derivative contracts that extend past the june cessation date for the 3q22 form 10q report part i item managements discussion analysis mda remaining usd libor tenors noted above fhn bankers have begun amending the pricing of existing liborbased commercial loans via a rate change at the time of loan renewal or via amendments to the loan documents to change the benchmark rate additionally fhn bankers have begun amending interest rate derivative contracts whose tenors extend beyond the june final cessation date of libor while fhn has exposure to libor in various contracts eg securities derivatives fhns primary exposure to libor is in floating rate loans to customers and derivative contracts issued to customers through fhn financial below is a summary of these exposures as of

met in order to qualify for the beneficial transition approach and fhn is considering this guidance in its transition plans critical accounting policies and estimates fhn has made no significant
