interestearning assets generally loans leases and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities generally deposits and borrowed funds the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on average interestearning assets and the effective cost of interestbearing liabilities these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the frb and market interest rates net interest income of billion in increased million or from the increase was largely driven by higher earning asset yields and loan growth partially offset by higher funding costs fhns net interest margin increased basis points to in compared to while the net interest spread decreased basis points to over the same period the net interest margin was favorably impacted by a basis point increase in earning asset yields largely reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and lower levels of excess cash in addition the

tax credit investments the effective rate is unfavorably affected by the nondeductible portions of fdic premium executive compensation and merger expenses fhns effective tax rate also may be affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period such as changes in unrecognized tax benefits the rate also may be affected by items resulting from business combinations the reduction in the rate from was primarily related to the benefit from the settlement of uncertain tax positions related to prior merger related items which was partially offset by the additional tax expense from the surrender of bankowned life insurance policies a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities the tax consequence is calculated by applying current enacted statutory tax rates to these temporary

securities portfolio consisting primarily of government agency issued mortgagebacked securities and collateralized mortgage obligations the securities portfolio provides a source of income and liquidity and is an important tool used to balance the interest rate risk of the loan and deposit portfolios the securities portfolio is periodically evaluated in light of established alm objectives changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio the regulatory environment and the level of interest rate risk to which fhn is exposed these evaluations may result in steps taken to adjust the overall balance sheet positioning investment securities were billion and billion on december and representing and of total assets respectively see note investment securities for more information about the securities portfolio the following table presents an analysis of the amortized cost remaining contractual maturities and weightedaverage yields by contractual maturity for the debt securities portfolio asset quality loan and lease portfolio composition fhn groups its loans into portfolio segments based on internal classifications reflecting the manner in which the alll is established and how credit risk is measured monitored and reported from time to time and if conditions are such that certain subsegments are uniquely affected by economic or market conditions or are experiencing greater deterioration than other components of the loan portfolio management may determine the alll at a more granular level commercial loans are composed of ci loans and cre loans consumer loans are composed of consumer real estate loans and credit card and other loans fhn has a concentration of residential real estate loans of and of total loans in and respectively industry concentrations are discussed under the ci heading below underwriting policies and procedures the following sections describe each portfolio as well as general underwriting procedures for each as economic and real estate conditions develop enhancements to underwriting and credit policies and procedures may be necessary or desirable loan policies and procedures for all portfolios are reviewed by credit risk working groups and management risk committees comprised of business line managers and credit administration professionals as well as by various other reviewing bodies within fhn policies and procedures are approved by key executives andor senior managers leading the applicable credit risk working groups as well as by management risk committees the credit risk working groups and management risk committees strive to ensure that the approved policies and procedures address the associated risks and establish reasonable underwriting criteria that appropriately mitigate risk policies and procedures are reviewed revised and reissued periodically at established review dates or earlier if changes in the economic environment portfolio performance the size of portfolio or industry concentrations or regulatory guidance warrant an earlier review commercial loan and lease portfolios fhns commercial loan approval process grants lending authority based upon job description experience and performance the lending authority is delegated to the business line market managers departmental managers regional presidents relationship managers rm and portfolio managers pm and to credit risk managers while individual limits vary the predominant amount of approval authority is vested with the credit risk management function portfolio industry and borrower concentration limits for the various portfolios are established by executive management and approved by the risk committee of the board fhns commercial lending process incorporates an rm and a pm for most commercial credits the rm is primarily responsible for communications with the borrower and maintaining the relationship while the pm is responsible for assessing the credit quality of the borrower beginning with the initial underwriting and continuing through the servicing period other specialists and the assigned rmpm are organized into units called deal teams deal teams are constructed with specific job attributes that facilitate fhns ability to identify mitigate document and manage ongoing risk pms and credit analysts provide enhanced analytical support during loan origination and servicing including monitoring of the financial condition of the borrower and tracking compliance with loan agreements loan closing officers and the construction loan management unit specialize in loan documentation and the management of the construction lending process fhn strives to identify problem assets early through comprehensive policies and guidelines targeted portfolio reviews more frequent servicing on lower rated borrowers and an emphasis on frequent grading for smaller commercial credits generally million or less and incomeproducing cre credits greater than million to nonprofessional real estate developers and smaller professional real estate investorsdevelopers fhn utilizes a centralized underwriting unit in order to originate and grade small business loans more efficiently and consistently fhn may utilize availability of guarantorssponsors to support commercial lending decisions during the credit underwriting process and when determining the assignment of internal loan grades reliance on the guaranty as a viable secondary source of repayment is a function of an analysis proving capability to pay factoring in among other things liquidity and directindirect cash flows fhn also considers the volume and amount of guaranties provided for all global indebtedness and the likelihood of realization fhn presumes a guarantors willingness to perform until there is any current or prior indication or future expectation that the guarantor may not willingly and voluntarily perform under the terms of the guaranty in fhns risk grading approach it is deemed that financial support becomes necessary generally at a point when the loan would otherwise be graded substandard reflecting a welldefined weakness at that point provided willingness and capacity to support are appropriately demonstrated a strong legally enforceable guaranty can mitigate the risk of default or loss justify a less severe rating and consequently reduce the level of allowance or chargeoff that might otherwise be deemed appropriate ci ci loans are the largest component of the loan and lease portfolio comprising and of total loans and leases at december and respectively the ci portfolio is comprised of loans used for general business purposes products offered in the ci portfolio include term loan financing of owneroccupied real estate and fixed assets direct financing and salestype leases working capital lines of credit and trade credit enhancement through letters of credit incomeproducing ci loans are underwritten in accordance with a welldefined credit origination process this process includes applying minimum underwriting standards as well as separation of origination and credit approval roles on transaction sizes over pm authorization limits underwriting typically includes due diligence of the borrower and the applicable industry of the borrower analysis of the borrowers available financial information identification and analysis of the various sources of repayment and identification of the primary risk attributes stress testing the borrowers financial capacity adherence to loan documentation requirements and assigning credit risk grades using internally developed scorecards are also used to help quantify the risk when appropriate underwriting parameters also include loantovalue ratios which vary depending on collateral type use of guaranties loan agreement requirements and other recommended terms such as equity requirements amortization and maturity approval decisions also consider various financial ratios and performance measures of the borrowers such as cash flow and balance sheet leverage liquidity coverage of fixed charges and working capital additionally approval decisions consider the capital structure of the borrower sponsorship and qualityvalue of collateral generally guideline and policy exceptions are identified and mitigated during the approval process pricing of ci loans is based upon the determined credit risk specific to the individual borrower historically these loans typically have had variable rates tied to the libor or prime rate of interest plus or minus the appropriate margin however with the cessation of libor fhn no longer references libor in new loan contracts and substantially all of the existing portfolio of loans tied to libor has been repriced to alternative reference rates the largest geographical concentrations of balances as of december were in tennessee florida texas north carolina louisiana georgia and california with no other state representing or more of the portfolio the following table provides the composition of the ci portfolio by industry as of december and for purposes of this disclosure industries are determined based on the naics industry codes used by federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the collection analysis and publication of statistical data related to the us business economy industry concentrations loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are loans to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions loans to mortgage companies and borrowers in the finance and insurance industry were and of fhns ci loan portfolio as of december and respectively and as a result could be affected by items that uniquely impact the financial services industry loans to borrowers in the real estate and rental and leasing industry were and of fhns ci portfolio as of december and respectively as of december fhn did not have any other concentrations of ci loans in any single industry of or more of total loans loans to mortgage companies loans to mortgage companies were of the ci portfolio as of december and of the ci portfolio as of december this portfolio includes commercial lines of credit to qualified mortgage companies primarily for the temporary warehousing of eligible mortgage loans prior to the borrowers sale of those mortgage loans to third party investors balances in this portfolio generally fluctuate with mortgage rates and seasonal factors generally new loan originations to mortgage lenders increase when there is a decline in mortgage rates and decrease when rates rise in rates rose in periods of economic uncertainty this trend may not occur even if interest rates are declining in approximately of the loan originations were home purchases and were refinance transactions finance and insurance the finance and insurance component represented of the ci portfolio as of december compared to at the end of and includes trups ie longterm unsecured loans to bank and insurancerelated businesses loans to bank holding companies and assetbased lending to consumer finance companies as of december assetbased lending to consumer finance companies represents approximately billion of the finance and insurance component real estate and rental and leasing loans to borrowers in the real estate and rental and leasing industry were and of fhns ci portfolio as of december and respectively this portfolio primarily consists of equipment financing loans and leases to clients across fhns footprint in a broad range of industries and asset types this portfolio also includes a smaller balance of loans and leases for solar and wind generating facilities commercial real estate the cre portfolio totaled billion as of december a billion or increase compared to december the cre portfolio includes both financings for commercial construction and nonconstruction loans this portfolio contains loans draws on lines and letters of credit to commercial real estate developers for the construction and minipermanent financing of incomeproducing real estate residential cre loans include loans to residential builders and developers for the purpose of constructing singlefamily homes condominiums and town homes and on a limited basis for developing residential subdivisions the residential cre class is not currently an area of growth for the bank incomeproducing cre loans incomeproducing cre loans are underwritten in accordance with credit policies and underwriting guidelines that are reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary based on market conditions loans are underwritten based upon project type size location sponsorship and other marketspecific data generally minimum requirements for equity debt service coverage ratios and level of preleasing activity are established based on perceived risk in each subcategory loantovalue limits are set below regulatory prescribed ceilings and generally range between and depending on the underlying product set term and amortization requirements are set based on prudent standards for interim real estate lending equity requirements are established based on the quality and liquidity of the primary source of repayment for example more equity would be required for a speculative construction project or land loan than for a property fully leased to a credit tenant or a roster of tenants typically a borrower must have at least of cost invested in a project before fhn will provide loan funding income properties are generally required to achieve a debt service coverage ratio greater than or equal to at inception or stabilization of the project based on loan amortization and a minimum underwriting interest rate some product types that possess a greater risk profile require a higher level of equity as well as a higher debt service coverage ratio threshold a proprietary minimum underwriting interest rate is used to calculate compliance with underwriting standards generally specific levels of preleasing must be met for construction loans on income properties where applicable a global cash flow analysis is performed at the sponsor level the credit administration and ongoing monitoring consists of multiple internal control processes construction loans are closed by a centralized control unit and construction loan management is administered centrally for loans million and over underwriters and credit approval personnel stress the borrowersprojects financial capacity utilizing numerous attributes such as interest rates vacancy capitalization rates and debt service coverage ratios under various scenarios key information is captured from the various portfolios and then stressed at the aggregate level results are utilized to assist with the assessment of the adequacy of the alll and to steer portfolio management strategies the largest geographical concentrations of cre balances as of december were in florida texas north carolina georgia tennessee and louisiana with no other state representing more than of the portfolio the following table represents subcategories of cre loans by property type consumer loan portfolios consumer real estate the consumer real estate portfolio is primarily composed of home equity lines and installment loans this portfolio totaled billion and billion as of december and respectively the largest geographical concentrations of balances in the consumer real estate portfolio as of december were in florida tennessee texas louisiana north carolina new york and georgia with no other state representing or more of the portfolio as of december approximately of the consumer real estate portfolio was in a first lien position at origination the weighted average fico score of this portfolio was and the refreshed fico scores averaged as of december no significant change from fico scores of and respectively as of december generally performance of this portfolio is affected by life events that affect borrowers finances the level of unemployment and home prices as of december and fhn had heldtomaturity consumer mortgage loans secured by real estate totaling million and million respectively that were in the process of foreclosure helocs comprised billion and billion of the consumer real estate portfolio for december and respectively fhns helocs typically have a or year draw period followed by a or year repayment period respectively during the draw period a borrower is able to draw on the line and is only required to make interest payments the line is frozen if a borrower becomes past due on payments once the draw period has concluded the line is closed and the borrower is required to make both principal and interest payments monthly until the loan matures the principal payment generally is fully amortizing but payment amounts will adjust when variable rates reset to reflect changes in the prime rate as of december approximately of fhns helocs were in the draw period compared to at the end of based on when draw periods are scheduled to end per the line agreement it is expected that million or of helocs currently in the draw period will enter the repayment period during the next months based on current terms generally delinquencies for helocs that have entered the repayment period are initially higher than helocs still in the draw period because of the increased minimum payment requirement however over time performance of these loans usually begins to stabilize helocs nearing the end of the draw period are closely monitored the following table shows the helocs currently in the draw period and expected timing of conversion to the repayment period underwriting for loans in this portfolio underwriting decisions are made through a centralized loan underwriting center to obtain a consumer real estate loan the loan applicants must first meet a minimum qualifying fico score minimum fico score requirements are established by management for both loans secured by real estate as well as nonreal estate loans management also establishes maximum loan amounts loantovalue ratios and debttoincome ratios for each consumer real estate product applicants must have the financial capacity or available income to service the debt by not exceeding a calculated debttoincome ratio the amount of the loan is limited to a percentage of the lesser of the current appraised value or sales price of the collateral identified guideline and policy exceptions require established mitigating factors that have been approved for use by credit risk management heloc interest rates are variable and adjust with movements in the index rate stated in the loan agreement such loans can have elevated risks of default particularly in a rising interest rate environment potentially stressing borrower capacity to repay the loan at the higher interest rate fhns current underwriting practice requires heloc borrowers to qualify based on a sensitized interest rate above the current note rate fully amortized payment methodology fhns underwriting guidelines require borrowers to qualify at an interest rate that is basis points above the note rate this mitigates risk to fhn in the event of a sharp rise in interest rates over a relatively short time horizon heloc portfolio risk management fhn performs continuous heloc account reviews to identify higherrisk home equity lines and initiate preventative and corrective actions the reviews consider a number of account activity patterns and characteristics such as the number of times delinquent within recent periods changes in credit bureau score since origination score degradation performance of the first lien and account utilization in accordance with fhns interpretation of regulatory guidance fhn may block future draws on accounts in order to mitigate risk of loss to fhn credit card and other the credit card and other consumer loan portfolio totaled million as of december and million as of december this portfolio primarily consists of consumerrelated credits including home equity and other personal consumer loans credit card receivables and automobile loans the million decrease was driven by net repayments partially offset by an increase in consumer construction loans allowance for credit losses the acl is maintained at a level sufficient to provide appropriate reserves to absorb estimated future credit losses in accordance with gaap for additional information regarding the acl see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included as a part of this report the alll increased to million as of december or of total loans and leases compared to million or of total loans and leases at the end of the acl to total loans and leases ratio increased to as of december from as of december the increase in the alll balance reflects the impact of loan growth an evolving macroeconomic outlook and modest grade migration nonperforming assets nonperforming loans are loans placed on nonaccrual if it becomes evident that full collection of principal and interest is at risk if impairment has been recognized as a partial chargeoff of principal balance due to insufficient collateral value and past due status or on a casebycase basis if fhn continues to receive payments but there are other borrowerspecific issues included in nonaccrual are loans for which fhn continues to receive payments including residential real estate loans where the borrower has been discharged of personal obligation through bankruptcy npas consist of nonperforming loans and leases and oreo excluding oreo from governmentinsured mortgages total npas increased million to million as of december largely driven by an increase in nonaccrual cre loans predominantly in the office sector as remote work became more prevalent over the last few years office vacancy rates have risen industrywide which in conjunction with a higher level of interest rates increased pressure on cash flows and valuations the ratio of nonperforming loans and leases to total loans and leases increased basis points to modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as part of fhns ongoing risk management practices fhn attempts to work with borrowers when appropriate to extend or modify loan terms to better align with their current ability to repay modifications to loans are made in accordance with internal policies and guidelines which conform to regulatory guidance each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately see note significant accounting policies note loans and leases and note allowance for credit losses for further discussion regarding troubled loan modifications commercial loan modifications as part of fhns credit risk management governance processes the loan rehab and recovery department lrrd is responsible for managing most commercial relationships with borrowers whose financial condition has deteriorated to such an extent that the credits are individually reviewed for expected credit losses classified as substandard or worse placed on nonaccrual status foreclosed or in process of foreclosure or in active or contemplated litigation lrrd has the authority and responsibility to enter into workout andor rehabilitation agreements with troubled commercial borrowers in order to mitigate andor minimize the amount of credit losses recognized from these problem assets while every circumstance is different lrrd will generally use forbearance agreements generally months as an element of commercial loan workouts which might include reduced interest rates reduced payments release of guarantor term extensions or entering into short sale agreements principal forgiveness may be granted in specific workout circumstances the individual expected credit loss assessments completed on commercial loans are used in evaluating the appropriateness of qualitative adjustments to quantitatively modeled loss expectations for loans that are not considered collateral dependent if a loan is collateral dependent the carrying amount of a loan is written down to the net realizable value of the collateral each assessment considers any modified terms and is comprehensive to ensure appropriate assessment of expected credit losses consumer loan modifications fhn does not currently participate in any of the loan modification programs sponsored by the us government but does generally structure modified consumer loans using the parameters of the former home affordable modification program within the heloc and real estate installment loans classes of the consumer portfolio segment troubled loans are typically modified by reducing the interest rate in increments of basis points to a minimum of for up to years and a possible maturity date extension to reach an affordable housing debttoincome ratio after years the interest rate generally returns to the original interest rate prior to modification for certain modifications the modified interest rate increases per year until the original interest rate prior to modification is achieved permanent mortgage troubled loans are typically modified by reducing the interest rate in increments of basis points to a minimum of for up to years and a possible maturity date extension to reach an affordable housing debttoincome ratio after years the interest rate steps up percent every year until it reaches the federal home loan mortgage corporation weekly survey rate cap contractual maturities may be extended to years on permanent mortgages and to years for consumer real estate loans within the credit card class of the consumer portfolio segment troubled loans are typically modified through either a shortterm credit card hardship program or a longerterm credit card workout program in the credit card hardship program borrowers may be granted rate and payment reductions for months to year in the credit card workout program clients are granted a rate reduction to and term extensions for up to years to pay off the remaining balance consumer loans may also be modified through courtimposed principal reductions in bankruptcy proceedings which fhn is required to honor unless a borrower reaffirms the related debt deposits total deposits of

of fhns deposit marketing campaigns launched in the second quarter promotional rates associated with these offerings moderated toward the end of the year but overall were higher than prior periods contributing to an increase in funding costs the rate guarantees on money market deposits in the campaign were shortterm and repriced in the back half of the fourth quarter fhn continues to focus on

tables provide a reconciliation of shareholders equity from the consolidated balance sheets to common equity tier tier and total regulatory capital as well as certain selected capital ratios banking regulators define minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries based on the capital rules and definitions prescribed by the banking regulators should any depository institutions capital ratios decline below predetermined levels it would become subject to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions the system categorizes a depository institutions capital position into one of five categories ranging from wellcapitalized to critically undercapitalized for an institution the size of fhn to qualify as wellcapitalized common equity tier tier capital total capital and leverage capital ratios must be at least and respectively furthermore a capital conservation buffer of basis points above these levels must be maintained on the common equity tier tier capital and total capital ratios to avoid restrictions on dividends share repurchases and certain discretionary bonuses as of december both fhn and first horizon bank had sufficient capital to qualify as wellcapitalized institutions and to meet the capital conservation buffer requirement capital ratios for both fhn and first horizon bank as of december are calculated under the final rule issued by the banking regulators in to delay the effects of cecl on regulatory capital for two years followed by a threeyear transition period for fhn the tier and total riskbased regulatory capital ratios increased in relative to primarily from the impact of net income less dividends the increase in the common equity tier ratio for fhn was largely driven by the conversion of the series g preferred stock to common stock during capital ratios are expected to remain above wellcapitalized standards plus the required capital conservation buffer stress testing the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act along with an interagency regulatory statement effectively exempted both fhn and first horizon bank from doddfrank act stress testing requirements starting in for fhn and first horizon bank completed a company run stress test using the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar scenarios published in february results of these tests indicate that both fhn

board replaced one of those programs fhns board has not authorized a preferred stock purchase program general purchase program on january fhn announced that its board of directors approved a new million common share purchase program that was to expire on january on october fhn announced that the program had been increased by million and extended to october the program was not further extended the program was not tied to any compensation plan purchases could be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions including under rule 10b51 plans as well as accelerated share repurchase and other structured transactions the timing and exact amount of common share repurchases were subject to various factors including fhns capital position financial performance expected capital impacts of strategic initiatives market conditions business conditions and regulatory considerations fhn did not purchase shares under this program during blackout periods when senior executives were prohibited from purchasing fhn stock on the open market as of expiration at october million in purchases had been made under the program at an average price per share of or excluding general purchase program on january fhn announced that its board of directors approved a new million common share purchase program that is scheduled to expire on january the program is not tied to any compensation plan purchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions including under rule 10b51 plans as well as accelerated share repurchase and other structured transactions the timing and exact amount of common share repurchases are subject to various factors including fhns capital position financial performance expected capital impacts of strategic initiatives market conditions business conditions and regulatory considerations fhn does not purchase shares under this program during blackout periods when senior executives are prohibited from purchasing fhn stock on the open market compensation plans purchase program a consolidated compensation plan share purchase program was announced on august this program consolidated into a single share purchase program all of the previously authorized compensation plan share programs as well as the renewal of the authorization to purchase shares for use in connection with compensation plans for which the share purchase authority had expired the primary objectives of this program were to mitigate dilution resulting from shares issued in connection with fhns various stockbased compensation plans and to implement automatic stock purchases related to tax withholding obligations associated with stockbased awards for many years the program was used entirely for the second objective the total amount authorized under this consolidated compensation plan share purchase program was million shares calculated before adjusting for stock dividends distributed through january the authorization was reduced for that portion which related to compensation plans for which no stock option awards remain outstanding the program expired on december prior to expiration purchases could have been made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and were subject to various factors including fhns capital position financial performance capital impacts of strategic initiatives market conditions and regulatory considerations however as mentioned above even though general repurchases were authorized for many years fhns use of this program was limited to automatically withholding shares associated with vested stock awards to cover tax obligations as of december immediately prior to expiration the maximum number of shares that could be purchased under the program was million shares automatic offmarket tax withholding purchases the compensation plans program has not been renewed or replaced with a formal program after as authorized by fhns board and the boards compensation committee fhn will continue to make automatic stock purchases by withholding shares associated with stockbased awards to cover tax obligations associated with those awards those limited offmarket purchases no longer will be connected to a traditional announced purchase program as has been true in the past automatic tax withholding purchases are not subject to trading blackouts which affect senior executives or the general purchase program risk management fhn derives revenue from providing services and in many cases assuming and managing risk for profit which exposes fhn to strategic reputational liquidity market capital adequacy operational compliance legal and credit risks that require ongoing oversight and management fhn has an enterprisewide approach to risk governance measurement management and reporting including an economic capital allocation process that is tied to risk profiles used to measure riskadjusted returns through an enterprisewide risk governance structure and a risk appetite statement approved by the board management continually evaluates the balance of riskreturn and earnings volatility with shareholder value fhns enterprisewide risk governance structure begins with the board the board working with the risk committee of the board establishes fhns risk appetite by approving policies and limits that provide standards for the nature and the level of risk fhn is willing to assume the board regularly receives reports on managements performance against fhns risk appetite primarily through the boards risk and audit committees to further support the risk governance provided by the board fhn has established accountabilities control processes procedures and a management governance structure designed to align risk management with risktaking throughout fhn the control procedures are aligned with fhns four components of risk governance specific risk committees the risk management organization business unit risk management and independent assurance functions 1specific risk committees the board has delegated authority to the chief executive officer to manage strategic risk and reputational risk and the general business affairs of fhn under the boards oversight the ceo utilizes the executive management team and the management risk committee to carry out these duties and to analyze existing and emerging strategic and reputational risks and determines the appropriate course of action the management risk committee is comprised of the ceo and certain officers designated by the ceo the management risk committee is supported by a set of specific risk committees focused on unique risk types eg liquidity credit operational etc these risk committees provide a mechanism that assembles the necessary expertise and perspectives of the management team to discuss emerging risk issues monitor fhns risktaking activities and evaluate specific transactions and exposures these committees also monitor the direction and trend of risks relative to business strategies and market conditions and direct management to respond to risk issues 2the risk management organization fhns risk management organization led by the chief risk officer and chief credit officer provides objective oversight of risktaking activities the risk management organization translates fhns overall risk appetite into approved limits and formal policies and is supported by corporate staff functions including the corporate secretary legal finance human resources and technology risk management also works with business units and functional experts to establish appropriate operating standards and monitor business practices in relation to those standards additionally risk management proactively works with business units and senior management to focus management on key risks in fhn and emerging trends that may change fhns risk profile the chief risk officer has overall responsibility and accountability for enterprise risk management and aggregate risk reporting 3business unit risk management fhns business units are responsible for identifying acknowledging quantifying mitigating and managing all risks arising within their respective units they determine and execute their business strategies which puts them closest to the changing nature of risks and they are best able to take the needed actions to manage and mitigate those risks the business units are supported by the risk management organization that helps identify and consider risks when making business decisions management processes structure and policies are designed to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations as well as provide organizational clarity for authority decisionmaking and accountability business units have designated control processes to help mitigate their identified risks and business units attest to the effectiveness of those controls the risk governance structure supports and promotes the escalation of material items to executive management and the board 4independent assurance functions internal audit credit assurance services cas compliance testing and model validation provide an independent and objective assessment of the design and execution of fhns internal control system including management processes risk governance and policies and procedures these groups activities are designed to provide reasonable assurance that risks are appropriately identified and communicated resources are safeguarded significant financial managerial and operating information is complete accurate and reliable and employee actions are in compliance with fhns policies and applicable laws and regulations internal audit and cas report to the chief audit executive who is appointed by and reports to the audit committee of the board internal audit reports quarterly to the audit committee of the board while cas reports quarterly to the risk committee of the board compliance testing and model validation report to the chief risk officer and report annually to the audit committee of the board market risk management market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions will adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities or otherwise negatively impact fhns earnings market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with fhns operations primarily trading activities within fhn financial but also through nontrading activities which are primarily affected by interest rate risk that is managed by the alco within fhn fhn is exposed to market risk related to the trading securities inventory and loans held for sale maintained by fhn financial in connection with its fixed income distribution activities various types of securities inventory positions are procured for distribution to clients by the sales staff when these securities settle on a delayed basis they are considered forward contracts refer to the determination of fair value trading securities and trading liabilities section of note fair value of assets and liabilities which section is incorporated into this mda by this reference fhns market risk appetite is approved by the risk committee of the board of directors and executed through management policies and procedures of alco and the fhn financial risk committee these policies contain various market risk limits including for example var limits for the trading securities inventory and individual position limits and sector limits for products with credit risk among others risk measures are computed and reviewed on a daily basis to ensure compliance with market risk management policies valueatrisk and stress testing var is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss in value from adverse market movements over an assumed fixed holding period within a stated confidence level fhn employs a model to compute daily var measures for its trading securities inventory fhn computes var using historical simulation with a 1year lookback period at a confidence level with 1day and 10day time horizons additionally fhn computes a stressed var measure the svar computation uses the same model but with model inputs reflecting historical data from a continuous 12month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate for our trading securities portfolio a summary of fhns var and svar measures for 1day and 10day time horizons is presented in the following table the potential risk of loss reflected by fhns var measures assumes the trading securities inventory is static because fhn financial procures fixed income securities for purposes of distribution to clients its trading securities inventory turns over regularly additionally fhnf traders actively manage the trading securities inventory continuously throughout each trading day accordingly fhnfs trading securities inventory is highly dynamic rather than static as a result it would be rare for fhnf to incur a negative revenue day in its fixed income activities at the levels indicated by its var measures in addition to being used in fhns daily market risk management process the var and svar measures are also used by fhn in computing its regulatory market risk capital requirements in accordance with the market risk capital rules for additional information regarding fhns capital adequacy refer to the capital section of this mda fhn also performs stress tests on its trading securities portfolio to calculate the potential loss under various assumed market scenarios key assumed stresses used in those tests are down bps assumes an instantaneous downward move in interest rates of basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve up bps assumes an instantaneous upward move in interest rates of basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve curve flattening assumes an instantaneous flattening of the interest rate yield curve through an increase in shortterm rates and a decrease in longterm rates the 2year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to increase basis points and the 10year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease basis points shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2year and 10year points curve steepening assumes an instantaneous steepening of the interest rate yield curve through a decrease in shortterm rates and an increase in long term rates the 2year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease basis points and the 10year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to increase basis points shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2year and 10year points credit spread widening assumes an instantaneous increase in credit spreads the difference between yields on treasury securities and nontreasury securities of basis points model validation trading risk management personnel within fhn financial have primary responsibility for model risk management with respect to the model used by fhn to compute its var measures and perform stress testing on the trading inventory among other procedures these personnel monitor model results and perform periodic backtesting as part of an ongoing process of validating the accuracy of the model these model risk management activities are subject to annual review by fhns model validation group an independent assurance group charged with oversight responsibility for fhns model risk management interest rate risk management interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movement in interest rates alco is responsible for overseeing the management of existing and emerging interest rate risk for the company within risk tolerances established by the board fhn primarily manages interest rate risk by structuring the balance sheet to maintain a desired level of associated earnings and to protect the economic value of fhns capital net interest income and the value of equity are affected by changes in the level of market interest rates because of the differing repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities the exercise of prepayment options held by loan clients the early withdrawal options held by deposit clients and changes in the basis between and changing shapes of the various yield curves used to price assets and liabilities to isolate the repricing basis option and yield curve components of overall interest rate risk fhn employs gap net interest income at risk and economic value of equity analyses generated by a balance sheet simulation model net interest income simulation analysis the information provided in this section including the discussion regarding the outcomes of simulation analysis and rate shock analysis is forwardlooking actual results if the assumed scenarios were to occur could differ because of interest rate movements the ability of management to execute its business plans and other factors including those presented in the forwardlooking statements section of this report management uses a simulation model to measure interest rate risk and to formulate strategies to improve balance sheet positioning earnings or both within fhns interest rate risk liquidity and capital guidelines interest rate exposure is measured by forecasting months of nii under various interest rate scenarios and comparing the percentage change in nii for each scenario to a base case scenario where interest rates remain unchanged assumptions are made regarding future balance sheet composition interest rate movements and loan and deposit pricing in addition assumptions are made about the magnitude of asset prepayments and earlier than anticipated deposit withdrawals the results of these scenarios help fhn develop strategies for managing exposure to interest rate risk while management believes the assumptions used and scenarios selected in its simulations are reasonable simulation modeling provides only an estimate not a precise calculation of exposure to any given change in interest rates based on a static balance sheet as of december nii exposures over the next months assuming rate shocks of plusminus basis points plusminus basis points plusminus basis points and plus basis points are estimated to have variances as shown in the table below a steepening yield curve scenario where longterm rates increase by basis points and shortterm rates are static results in a favorable nii variance of a flattening yield curve scenario where longterm rates decrease by basis points and shortterm rates are static results in an unfavorable nii variance of these hypothetical scenarios are used to create a risk measurement framework and do not necessarily represent managements current view of future interest rates or market developments shortterm interest rates have reached their highest levels in years which coupled with market disruption from recent high profile bank failures has increased competitive pressures on deposit costs the yield curve was inverted for much of the last half of and throughout the inverted yield curve indicates market expectations that shortterm rates have likely peaked and then could decline in future periods market participants are now projecting multiple rate cuts in while the december fed dot plot has indicated three basis point cuts in fhn continues to monitor current economic trends and potential exposures closely for additional information see yield curve within market uncertainties and prospective trends below fair value shock analysis interest rate risk and the slope of the yield curve also affect the fair value of fhns trading inventory that is reflected in noninterest income generally low or declining interest rates with a positively sloped yield curve tend to increase income through higher demand for fixed income products additionally the fair value of fhns trading inventory can fluctuate as a result of differences between current interest rates and the interest rates of fixed income securities in the trading inventory derivatives in the normal course of business fhn utilizes various financial instruments including derivative contracts and creditrelated agreements to manage the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of certain financial instruments generally caused by changes in interest rates including fhns securities inventory certain term borrowings and certain loans additionally fhn may enter into derivative contracts in order to meet clients needs however such derivative contracts are typically offset with a derivative contract entered into with an upstream counterparty in order to mitigate risk associated with changes in interest rates the simulation models and related hedging strategies discussed above exclude the dynamics related to how fee income and noninterest expense may be affected by actual changes in interest rates or expectations of changes see note derivatives for additional discussion of these instruments libor reference rate reform in march congress passed the adjustable interest rate libor act the legislation addresses loans that remained on libor as of the june cessation date and that either have no fallback provisions or that contain fallback provisions that do not identify a specific benchmark replacement per the legislation at the final cessation of usd libor banks may cause such loans to fall back to a sofrbased benchmark rate with such rate to be selected by the federal reserve board the libor act also provides safe harbor from liability for banks that select the boardselected replacement benchmark rate at the cessation of libor in december the federal reserve board issued regulation zz its final rule to implement the adjustable interest rate libor act fhn has complied with the terms of the libor act and regulation zz and amended substantially all of its contracts away from libor as of june for most financial products the most common alternative reference rates have been sofrbased benchmarks this is true for both new originations and legacy libor contracts that were subject to amendment or a transition by their terms capital risk management adequacy the capital management objectives of fhn are to provide capital sufficient to cover the risks inherent in fhns businesses to maintain excess capital to wellcapitalized standards and board policy and to assure ready access to the capital markets the capital stress testing committee chaired by the corporate treasurer reports to alco and is responsible for capital management oversight and provides a forum for addressing management issues related to capital adequacy this committee reviews sources and uses of capital key capital ratios segment economic capital allocation methodologies coordinates the annual enterprisewide stress testing process and considers other factors in monitoring and managing current capital levels as well as potential future sources and uses of capital the capital stress testing committee also recommends capital management policies which are submitted for approval to alco and the risk committee of the board as necessary operational risk management operational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes people or systems or from external events including data or network security breaches of fhn or of third parties affecting fhn or its clients this risk is inherent in all businesses operational risk is divided into the following risk areas which have been established at the corporate level to address these risks across the entire organization business resilience records management compliancelegal including bank secrecy act program governance fiduciary securityfraud financial including disclosure controls and procedures information technology including cybersecurity see the next section below model vendor insurance management measurement and reporting of operational risk are overseen by the operational risk fiduciary financial governance fhn financial risk and strategic investment board committees key representatives from the business segments operating units and supporting units are represented on these committees as appropriate these governance committees manage the individual operational risk types across fhn by setting standards monitoring activity initiating actions and reporting exposures and results key committee activities and decisions are reported to the appropriate governance committee or included in the enterprise risk report a quarterly analysis of risk within the organization that is provided to the risk committee emphasis is dedicated to refinement of processes and tools to aid in measuring and managing material operational risks and providing for a culture of awareness and accountability cybersecurity risk management overview as mentioned immediately above fhns operational risk function is divided into several risk areas each area has been established at the corporate level to address risks in that area across the entire organization one of those areasinformation technology it riskincludes cybersecurity risk management as fhn manages it it risk includes cybersecurity risk which in turn includes the risks from cyber fraud cyber theft cyber vandalism cyber ransom data and system security and other unauthorized incursions into fhns it systems it risk management also includes it system reliability data integrity it aspects of regulatory compliance and risks associated with the use of artificial intelligence tools and systems the discussion in this section focuses on cybersecurity additional information on this topic is presented in cybersecurity risks within item beginning on page key cybersecurity risk management goals cybersecurity risk management has two primary goals defend fhn and its clients from fraudulent and other unauthorized incursions and when an incursion happens detect and respond as soon as practical the optimal cybersecurity program will defend as much as is practical while also detecting rapidly those incursions that get through management structure key processes operational risk is managed by fhns operational risk op risk committee members of the op risk committee include seniorlevel representatives from these teams or departments enterprise risk management operations model risk enterprise data enterprise technology enterprise technology risk management credit and credit risk management legal security internal audit deposit loan operations retail and digital banking regional bank products mortgage banking accounting and fixed incomebond trading the op risk committee reports to fhns management risk committee which is headed by fhns chief risk officer who reports to fhns chief executive officer it risk is managed by the it risk working group overseen by the op risk committee the it risk working group meets quarterly to discuss emerging cyber risks regulatory changes vendor risk audits and outstandingissue resolution the group also provides updates to the op risk committee on it aspects of compliance policies and security standards members of the it risk working group include the head of enterprise technology along with personnel from nearly all of the teams and departments represented in op risk fhn also has a cybersecurity working group the cybersecurity working group which is outside of the risk management hierarchy meets quarterly its primary functions are to provide cybersecurity awareness to the executive leadership team and to provide highlevel support if a significant cybersecurity event occurs in connection with awareness a external vendors consultants law enforcement and other persons are invited to speak on industrywide cybersecurity topics to provide an independent view of external threats facing the industry and b members of the enterprise technology team provide updates regarding how fhn is addressing current risks and threats the cybersecurity working group includes fhns ceo the heads of fhns banking segments the heads of risk management enterprise technology security operations and legal and senior personnel in the other teams and departments represented in the it risk working group key leaders within these committees and groups and for these processes are fhns chief information officer and chief information security officer the chief information officer has substantial banking it and related experience had roles at fhn since related to it and data systems culminating in cio since prior to joining fhn had roles at a large regional bank including technology leader of the banks electronic payments platform related to treasury management and enterprise it architect and earned an ms in computer science as well as an mba the chief information security officer has over twenty years of banking it and related experience oversees information security and many related systems and processes has established riskbased security programs to meet regulatory requirements and align with business needs and has implemented numerous data protection data access and identity management systems fhn has a written computer security incident response plan csirp outlining fhns incident response and communication processes fhns chief information security officer or certain other managers have the authority to initiate the execution of the csirp if an incident occurs a working group called the computer security incident response team has primary responsibility to implement or coordinate many of the csirp actions along with fhns it risk working group key goals of the csirp are to contain remediate and recover mitigate impact on fhn and clients report findings to op risk and other senior management and manage external communications the cybersecurity working group is informed of incidents that appear to have a significant risk of becoming material fhn engages third party vendors to conduct several periodic cybersecurity reviews network penetration testing cyber security maturity assessment red team simulated cyber attack testing sox financial reporting controls and data integrity testing and pcidss proprietary data security standard for payment systems attestation of compliance and soc type ii reports attesting to the design and operation of cybersecurity systems for lockbox and electronic bill pay the frequency of these reviews ranges from several times per year to every three years fhn also has a cybersecurity incident specialty firm on retainer for incident response as needed fhn has a dedicated thirdparty risk management tprm department reporting to the chief risk officer tprm engages the it risk working group to perform cybersecurity assessments for new vendors during onboarding reassessments of existing vendors on a riskbased cadence and continuous monitoring of critical thirdparties board oversight the boards risk committee oversees all risk management functions for the enterprise including op risk it risk and cybersecurity risk the boards information technology committee oversees management of fhns it systems including their adequacy now and in the future and their security in relation to cybersecurity risk management the functions of the two committees overlap to an extent the risk committee as well as the full board each quarter receive a risk management update from fhns chief risk officer each update includes a written presentation covering all major risk areas including op risk and each is supported by a detailed enterprise risk report which is available to all directors major topics in the op risk portion of the enterprise risk report each quarter include fraud and related incidents process management which includes many processes related to cybersecurity defenses and information security which addresses core cybersecurity processes and incidents tactical operational other impacts the measures fhn takes to manage cybersecurity risk affect how associates and clients use fhns platforms and systems for every safeguard considered or implemented fhn must weigh potential and actual inconveniences against security concerns practical realities make it impossible to maximize security and ignore resulting restrictions on the ability of associates and clients to conduct banking and financial business primarily for that reason cybersecurity risks are and will be a major risk management concern and losses from incursions will be impossible to avoid as mentioned above fhns goals are to prevent what can be prevented and detect and respond to incursions that get through as quickly as possible for those incursions that are not blocked fhns processes are designed to detect them quickly enough so that the financial and operational impact on fhn is zero or modest but the risk of a major incursion occurring cannot be reduced to zero a major incursion could have a material financial impact on fhns business operations and earnings compliance risk management compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions material financial loss or loss to reputation as a result of failure to comply with laws regulations rules selfregulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to fhns activities management measurement and reporting of compliance risk are overseen by the operational risk committee and other key corporate governance committees key executives from the business segments legal compliance risk management and service functions are represented on the committees summary reports of committee activities and decisions are provided to the appropriate governance committees reports include the status of regulatory activities internal compliance program initiatives compliance testing and internal audit results and evaluation of emerging compliance risk areas credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a borrowers or counterpartys ability to meet its financial obligations under agreed upon terms fhn is subject to credit risk in lending trading investing liquidityfunding and asset management activities although lending activities have the most exposure to credit risk the nature and amount of credit risk depends on the types of transactions the structure of those transactions collateral received the use of guarantors and the parties involved fhn assesses and manages credit risk through a series of policies processes measurement systems and controls the credit risk management committee crmc is responsible for overseeing the management of existing and emerging credit risks in the company within the broad risk tolerances established by the board the crmc reports through the management risk committee the credit risk management function led by the chief credit officer provides strategic and tactical credit leadership by maintaining policies overseeing credit approval assessing new credit products strategies and processes and managing portfolio composition and performance while the credit risk function oversees fhns credit risk management there is significant coordination between the business lines and the credit risk function in order to manage fhns credit risk and maintain strong asset quality the credit risk function recommends portfolio industrysector and individual client limits to the risk committee of the board for approval adherence to these approved limits is vigorously monitored by credit risk which provides recommendations to slow or cease lending to the business lines as commitments near established lending limits credit risk also ensures subject matter experts are providing oversight support and credit approvals particularly in the specialty lending areas where industryspecific knowledge is required management emphasizes general portfolio servicing such that emerging risks are able to be spotted early enough to correct potential deficiencies prevent further credit deterioration and mitigate credit losses the credit risk management function assesses the asset quality trends and results as well as lending processes adherence to underwriting guidelines portfoliospecific underwriting guidelines are discussed further in the asset quality trends section and utilizes this information to inform management regarding the current state of credit quality and as a factor of the estimation process for determining the allowance for credit losses the crmc reviews on a periodic basis various reports issued by assurance functions which provide an independent assessment of the adequacy of loan servicing grading accuracy and other key functions additionally crmc is presented with and discusses various portfolios lending activity and lendingrelated projects all of the above activities are subject to independent review by fhns credit assurance services group cas reports to the chief audit executive who is appointed by and reports to the audit committee of the board and provides quarterly reports to the risk committee of the board cas is charged with providing the risk committee of the board and executive management with independent objective and timely assessments of fhns portfolio quality credit policies and credit risk management processes liquidity risk management among other things alco is responsible for liquidity management the funding of assets with liabilities of appropriate duration while mitigating the risk of unexpected cash needs alco and the board of directors have adopted a liquidity policy of which the objective is to ensure that fhn meets its cash and collateral obligations promptly in a costeffective manner and with the highest degree of reliability after the banking crisis in the first half of alco and the board examined the liquidity risk management framework and policies to ensure alignment with evolving regulatory expectations industry best practices and the companys risk appetite the maintenance of adequate levels of asset and liability liquidity should provide fhn with the ability to meet both expected and unexpected cash and collateral needs key liquidity ratios asset liquidity levels and the amount available from funding sources are reported to alco on a regular basis fhns liquidity policy establishes liquidity limits that are deemed appropriate for fhns risk profile in accordance with the liquidity policy alco manages fhns exposure to liquidity risk through a dynamic real time forecasting methodology base liquidity forecasts are reviewed by alco and are updated as financial conditions dictate in addition to the baseline liquidity reports robust stress testing of assumptions and funds availability are periodically reviewed fhn maintains a contingency funding plan that may be executed should unexpected difficulties arise in accessing funding that affects fhn the industry or both as of december available liquidity sources included cash incremental borrowing capacity at the fhlb access to federal reserve bank borrowings through the discount window and the bank term funding program and unencumbered securities additional sources of liquidity included dealer and commercial customer repurchase agreements access to the overnight and term federal funds markets brokered deposits loan sales and syndications the frb bank term funding program will expire on march the table generally a primary source of funding for a bank is core deposits from the banks client base the periodend loanstodeposits ratio was and as of december and december respectively fhn may also use unsecured shortterm borrowings as a source of liquidity federal funds purchased from correspondent bank clients are considered to be substantially more stable than funds purchased in the national broker markets for federal funds due to the long historical and reciprocal nature of banking services provided by fhn to these correspondent banks the remainder of fhns wholesale shortterm borrowings consists of securities sold under agreements to repurchase transactions accounted for as secured borrowings with business clients or broker dealer counterparties both fhn and first horizon bank have the ability to generate liquidity by issuing senior or subordinated unsecured debt preferred equity and common equity subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements as of december fhn had outstanding million in senior and subordinated unsecured debt and million in noncumulative perpetual preferred stock as of december first horizon bank and subsidiaries had outstanding preferred shares of million which are reflected as noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheets parent company liquidity is primarily provided by cash flows stemming from dividends and interest payments collected from subsidiaries these sources of cash represent the primary sources of funds to pay cash dividends to shareholders and principal and interest to debt holders of fhn the amount paid to the parent company through first horizon bank common dividends is managed as part of fhns overall cash management process subject to applicable regulatory restrictions certain regulatory restrictions exist regarding the ability of first horizon bank to transfer funds to fhn in the form of cash common dividends loans or advances at any given time the pertinent portions of those regulatory restrictions allow first horizon bank to declare preferred or common dividends without prior regulatory approval in an aggregate amount equal to first horizon banks retained net income for the two most recently completed years plus the current yeartodate period for any period first horizon banks retained net income generally is equal to first horizon banks regulatory net income reduced by the preferred and common dividends declared by first horizon bank applying the dividend restrictions imposed under applicable federal and state rules as outlined above the banks total amount available for dividends was billion as of january consequently on that date the bank could pay common dividends up to that amount to its sole common shareholder fhn or to its preferred shareholders without prior regulatory approval additionally a capital conservation buffer must be maintained as described in the capital section of this report to avoid restrictions on dividends in march fhn agreed to suspend the dividend reinvestment plan in connection with the td transaction during the suspension period dividend payments of fhn are not automatically reinvested in additional shares of fhn common stock and participants in the plan are not able to purchase shares of fhn common stock through optional cash investments under the plan first horizon bank declared and paid common dividends to the parent company in the amount of million in and million in in january first horizon bank declared and paid a common dividend to the parent company in the amount of million first horizon bank declared and paid preferred dividends in each quarter of and additionally first horizon bank declared preferred dividends in first quarter payable in april payment of a dividend to shareholders of fhn is dependent on several factors which are considered by the board these factors include fhns current and prospective capital liquidity and other needs applicable regulatory restrictions including capital conservation buffer requirements and availability of funds to fhn through a dividend from first horizon bank additionally banking regulators generally require insured banks and bank holding companies to pay cash dividends only out of current operating earnings consequently the decision of whether fhn will pay future dividends and the amount of dividends will be affected by current operating results fhn paid a cash dividend of per common share on january fhn paid cash dividends of per series e preferred share and per series f preferred share on january and per series b preferred share and per series c preferred share on february in addition in january the board approved cash dividends per share in the following amounts offbalance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business fhn is a party to a number of activities that contain credit market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the consolidated financial statements such activities include traditional offbalance sheet creditrelated financial instruments fhn enters into commitments to extend credit to borrowers including loan commitments lines of credit standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit many of the commitments are expected to expire unused or be only partially used therefore the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements and are not included in the table below based on its available liquidity and available borrowing capacity fhn anticipates it will continue to have sufficient funds to meet its current commitments see note contingencies and other disclosures for more information contractual obligations the following table sets forth contractual obligations representing required and potential cash outflows as of december purchase obligations represent obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on fhn and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction repurchase obligations prior to september legacy first horizon originated loans through its pre2009 mortgage business primarily first lien home loans with the intention of selling them as discussed in note contingencies and other disclosures fhns principal remaining exposures for those activities relate to i indemnification claims by underwriters loan purchasers and other parties which assert that fhnoriginated loans caused or contributed to losses which fhn is legally obliged to indemnify and ii indemnification or other claims related to fhns servicing of pre2009 mortgage loans fhns approach for determining the adequacy of the repurchase and foreclosure reserve has evolved sometimes substantially based on changes in information available repurchasemakewhole rates vary based on purchaser vintage and claim type for those loans repurchased or covered by a makewhole payment cumulative average loss severities range between and percent of the upb repurchase accrual approach in determining potential loss content claims are analyzed by purchaser vintage and claim type fhn considers various inputs including claim rate estimates historical average repurchase and loss severity rates mortgage insurance cancellations and mortgage insurance curtailment requests inputs are applied to claims in the active pipeline as well as to historical average inflows to estimate loss content related to potential future inflows management also evaluates the nature of claims from purchasers andor servicers of loans sold to determine if qualitative adjustments are appropriate repurchase and foreclosure liability as discussed in note contingencies and other disclosures fhns repurchase and foreclosure liability primarily related to its pre2009 mortgage origination sale securitization and servicing businesses is comprised of accruals to cover estimated loss content in the active pipeline estimated future inflows and

foreclosure liability which includes both the legacy pre2009 business and the current mortgage business was million as of both december and market uncertainties and prospective trends fhns future results could be affected both positively and negatively by several known trends key among those are changes in the us and global economy and outlook government actions affecting interest rates and government actions and proposals which could have positive or negative impacts on the economy at large or on certain businesses industries or sectors additional risks relate to political uncertainty changes in federal policies including those publicly discussed formally proposed or recently implemented and the potential impacts of those changes on our businesses and clients and whether fhns strategic initiatives will succeed in addition to trends and events noted elsewhere in this mda fhn believes the following trends and events are noteworthy at this time inflation recession and federal reserve policy economic overview the postcovid economy in the us has been marked by strong inflation which began in peaked in and abated though not fully in the federal reserve implementing a tightening policy in to contain inflation by rapidly increasing shortterm interest rates and ending asset purchases low unemployment rates moderate economic growth and a profoundly inverted yield curve in and key aspects were although the us economy flirted with recession in it did not officially enter one in recession expectations moderated significantly early in recession expectations for the rest of this year generally are low the rise in shortterm interest rates by the federal reserve in was both rapid and substantial taking the overnight fed funds rate from in march to a year later hikes after that were much more modest and infrequent in response to 2022s extremely rapid and vigorous tightening of monetary policy the inflation rate in the us now is well below 2022s levels however many measures of inflation remain higher than the federal reserves stated longterm goal of early in the federal reserve has signaled that hikes have ended and that a short term rate cut might become appropriate no policy or timing commitments have been made future actions continue to depend upon future data some concern remains that recent inflation data which has been good may prove to be transitory monetary tightening often creates yield curve inversion for a time in the current cycle traditional inversion when tenyear treasury rates are below twoyear rates has been both very deep and unusually sustained with the current inversion having begun in the summer of many factors likely contributed to the current sustained inversion the immediate cause of course was that demand for longterm treasury debt remained high depressing yields even though short yields were higher fhn believes that a significant factor behind that demand preference in was continuing market expectations that the federal reserve would start to reduce shortterm rates soon in order to avoid or mitigate a recession early in federal reserve communications suggest that no ratecut action is likely soon a shortterm rate cut by the federal reserve should lessen inversion but only if longterm rates do not likewise drop key events and circumstances are noted in the following discussions federal reserve and rates the federal reserve raised shortterm rates several times in and in the first part of all but one of the raises in were and basis points each aggressive by historical standardswhile the raises were the moretypical basis points each the federal reserve has expressed its intent to bring inflation under control even at the risk of creating or deepening an economic recession the federal reserve has indicated that future decisions will be heavily impacted by economic data especially inflationrate and trend data available at each decision point most recently the federal reserve has indicated based on late2023 data an expectation that its next action at an unspecified future point will be a rate cut fhn cannot predict exactly when or how much shortterm rates will be changed how marketdriven longterm rates will behave nor how those actions may affect financial markets during yield curve unusual yield curve effects including inversion are common when monetary policy changes a traditional measure of inversion occurs when the twoyear us treasury rate is higher than the tenyear rate traditional inversion has been sustained continuously since the summer of an unusually long period the degree of inversion has varied during that period but generally has been much deeper than is typical sustained traditional yield curve inversion is viewed with statistical support as a harbinger of economic recession but recession has not yet occurred and the us economy currently does not appear close to entering one the most recent period with deep and longerlasting inversion was over years ago that year period was marked by stagflation low economic growth coupled with high inflation followed by extremely robust interest rate hikes and a severe recession yield curve flattening and inversion generally reduces the profit fhn can make from lending by compressing fhns net interest margin and also generally reduces fhns revenues from bond trading these impacts have occurred and are continuing during the current inversion refer to interest rate yield curve risks located in item risk factors beginning on page for a discussion of the risks to fhn associated with flattening and inversion recession the us economy contracted experienced negative growth during the first two quarters of in both cases modestly although two consecutive quarters of contraction often coincides with recession in it did not the economy expanded in each quarter since then recession expectations in the us were high in and first quarter they moderated significantly after that current recession expectations generally are low banking crisis in march two large regional us banks failed after sudden large deposit outflows and a major swiss bank was acquired by another bank at the behest of regulators in the aftermath of the two us failures bank investors and clients across the us became more focused on deposit mix funding risk management and other safetysoundness concerns the market values of virtually all us bank stocks fell quickly and strongly in march with a few falling about following these failures the media published stories about actual and possible bank runs by depositors most us banks saw net outflows of deposits in and early as the impacts of covid19 crisis programs faded and rates available from nonbankaccount investments improved according to federal reserve data starting in midmarch the two failures triggered an abrupt and substantial net deposit outflow from all but the largest us banks the march crisis shock was shortlived however during the final week of march both large and small us banks collectively experienced net inflows of deposits roughly mirroring the first week of march before the crisis emerged the two us bank failures resulted in congressional calls for higher regulation of midsized regional banks especially for those with billion or more of assets in early may a third large regional us bank failed after experiencing very large deposit outflows in march although this failure was widely anticipated volatility in regional bank stocks reappeared in may by june bankstock volatility had abated again but with regional bank prices well below precrisis levels the three failed us banks had a few characteristics that fhn believes were significant negative factors contributing to loss of confidence by depositors in addition to having an unusual customer mix wellabovemedian levels of deposits not covered by fdic insurance significant portions of the pandemic deposit inflows invested in longerterm fixedrate debt securities and very high in relation to regulatory capital market value losses on those investments when rates rose in and early these factors made those banks unusually susceptible to a cascade of negative effects when deposit levels diminished for the entire industry starting in as customers sought better returns in the rising rate environment market volatility valuations as a result of the prospects for recession coupled with the uncertainties associated with war in eastern europe financial markets worldwide were volatile during much of volatility overall has moderated somewhat in but volatile episodes have continued war in the middle east that started in october had a much more muted financial impact than was true in financial asset values broadly fell in especially during the second and third quarters by midyear broad stock indices largely had recovered from 2022s low points but longerterm fixedrate debt investments remained well below previous values by yearend stock values in most but not all sectors had recouped much of their earlier losses and debt investment values generally improved somewhat from their lows when longterm rates fell in anticipation of possible shortterm rate cuts in by the federal reserve impacts on fhn in fhn benefited significantly from rising rates as the rise in lending rates outpaced the rise in deposit and other funding rates in the first quarter of that outpacing ended and fhns net interest margin started to compress fhn was able to reverse the compression during the year fueled in part by using increased deposits and capital to reduce borrowings going forward although net interest margin levels may improve modestly while short term rates remain steady margins are not likely to improve appreciably until the yield curve inversion mentioned above has ended and the curve takes at least a moderately steep slope in and early fhn experienced a normalization of deposit levels since first quarter as it allowed surge deposits resulting from coviddriven stimulus programs to move off its balance sheet net deposit outflows ranged from roughly to billion in each of the last three quarters of and fell again by roughly billion in first quarter that outflow trend ended in second quarter as fhn had net deposit inflows of billion for the year net deposits increased over billion however fhn increased deposit rates appreciably in particularly in may and june the may and june deposit inflows mainly consisted of ordinary accounts with promo rates and of certificates of deposit or cds with very attractive fixed rates the promo rates ended late in and a large group of those cds matured during that time a challenge for fhn is to retain as many of those deposit dollars and depositor customers as is reasonably practical while moderating the rates fhn pays in addition some of fhns businesses have been negatively impacted by rising rates rate increases have pushed home mortgage rates in the us much higher than in early reducing demand fhns direct mortgage lending and lending to mortgage companies saw business decline significantly in and moreover fhns revenues from bond trading and related activities fell significantly in and due to rising rates coupled with elevated market volatility a recession if one were to occur likely would have a negative impact on fhns businesses overall demand for loans likely would fall loan losses and provision expense likely would rise many commercial activities that generate fee income likely would decline and competition for clients likely would sharpen fhn already has experienced some of these impacts the deeper or longer a recession lasts the more significant these negative impacts are likely to be for fhn as mentioned above recessionary expectations have abated substantially since early however just as expectations in early proved to be wrong current expectations may be just as incorrect other regulatory proposals in the board of governors of the federal reserve and other regulators proposed regulatory changes that would if implemented significantly increase regulatory constraints and costs on all us banks with assets over billion a few new requirements would apply to banks like fhn with assets over billion but by far the main impacts would fall on banks greater than billion in assets the proposals touch upon many regulatory requirements including debt and equity capital requirements credit risk standards asset riskweighting and resolution planning the increased requirements also would entail additional compliance costs the triggering of significant cost increases based on a single threshold financial measure100 billion in assetshas been in place for many years and has impacted the us banking industry compliance restrictions and costs increase as the threshold is approached but a stepup pattern remains banks near the threshold may be likely to slow or even halt asset growth at least for a period and start to implement the higherlevel compliance systems banks modestly over the threshold in contrast may be likely to expand their asset base as quickly as possible to generate additional revenues to cover those costs those effects have added to the incentives for banks to consolidate and the proposed new rules are likely to enhance that it appears likely that if adopted as proposed significant parts of the proposals will be challenged in court as being inconsistent with legislation enacted by congress in such a challenge would be technical and complex and likely would take many years to resolve moreover even if a challenge of that sort were successful many parts of the proposals likely would remain intact and others might be modified without being rescinded greenhouse gas ghg reporting regimes in october the state of california enacted two laws which taken together will require most larger companies doing business in california to report annually their greenhouse gas ghg emissions with an external assurance requirement and to report biennially their climaterelated financial risks and riskmitigation measures the us securities and exchange commission sec has proposed but not yet adopted rules that would require all us companies with publiclytraded securities to report annually their ghg emissions the california laws include multiyear phase in periods and encompass scope scope and scope ghg emissions the sec proposal has scope and reporting requirements along with scope requirements in certain situations the california governor stated in that the new laws are likely to be subjected to technical amendments in the next year or so the sec proposal is not final and could change perhaps substantially when adopted three ghg scopes scope ghg emissions are those from a source the company owns or controls directly such as a manufacturing plant scope emissions are indirect emissions from company activities such as from power consumed by company operations scope and emissions generally can be measured or estimated using information a company normally can obtain without significant external inquiry scope ghg emissions are those from sources and activities that a company neither owns nor controls scope emissions are from a wide range of sources that touch upon a company such as vendors employees commuting business travel etc and customers scope information generally is unknown to a company without significant external inquiry andor estimation potential business impacts direct compliance costs will include creating systems to measure or estimate and capture relevant data staffing and engagement of vendors including a firm to provide required assurances somewhat analogous to a financial statement auditor potentially of more significance california may require inquiry of customers rather than merely estimation about them if fhn is allowed merely to estimate emissions from customers that process may be costly but would not interfere with our business relationships if however fhn is required to support scope reporting by obtaining ghgrelated information from customers including customers that are not public companies and that do no business in california then the california disclosure laws could interfere with fhns business in that case effectively fhn would be required to impose costs andor inconveniences on its customers other banks in fhns markets particularly those that are private and not doing business in california could provide financial services without those requirements putting fhn at a competitive disadvantage potential actual legal challenges the application of the california laws to companies outside of california has been challenged in court and other challenges may be brought challenges from outside the state have or may assert that the laws unconstitutionally burden interstate commerce unconstitutionally compel speech or possibly violate another constitutional protection or limitation current and potential future challenges could take many years to resolve a key practical question will be whether the courts impose a legal stay a moratorium on these laws while challenges are pending assuming the sec adopts final regulations similar to those proposed it appears very likely that legal challenges will be made based mainly on the fact that the sec lacks explicit congressional authorization to create a regulatory reporting regime pertaining to ghg emissions as with the california laws a key question will be whether the courts impose a stay on the rules while challenges are pending assuming the sec adopts final regulations similar to those proposed and further assuming that any legal challenge leaves those rules entirely or largely intact the california laws might be challenged by public companies as having been preempted by the sec rules coastal market growth and rising costs fhns principal markets are in the southern and southeastern united states including most of the major gulf coast markets and several markets on the southern atlantic seacoast many of fhns markets have experienced significant population growth over at least the past twenty years outpacing the growth rate for the us as a whole that population growth generally has been accompanied by economic growth many of fhns fastest growing markets including most significantly those in florida can be impacted significantly by hurricanes and other severe coastal weather events as those markets grow fhns economic commitment to them grows as does fhns financial exposure to those events in and this year it has been widely reported that the economic costs of hurricane events in the us gulf and southern atlantic coastal areas have been rising significantly fhn believes that rising costs are directly related to growth in those areas for example much of the growth in florida has been along the coast moving out from older cities a gulf coast hurricane or years ago had a fair chance of making landfall in a relatively unpopulated area now the chances of directly hitting a population center are much higher the average population in that center is much higher and the average value per building is much higher the reported significant increase in casualty risks and costs is being reflected in property insurance practices which currently are in significant flux the insurance industry is being forced to revise its risk assessment and premium pricing practices in coastal areas as loss experience has deviated from earlier predictions sometimes badly in florida for example some smaller carriers have failed some larger carriers have left markets and remaining carriers have significantly increased the premiums of hurricanerelated insurance narrowed coverage or both coastal states such as florida and louisiana have created lastresort insurance pools for residents who cannot obtain or afford private property insurance however as the costs borne by those pools increase either the premiums will have to rise or general taxation will have to cover the difference in addition those programs generally do not help business clients state and local building and watercontrol codes are being revised but often unevenly and often not retroactive to preexisting structures and developments the current transition period could be lengthy the availability reliability and cost of adequate property insurance is a significant concern for fhn as well as fhns clients in affected markets instability in property insurance has made and continues to make fhns business decisions more difficult that instability increases fhns risks of loan loss and business downturn more fundamentally elevated insurance and casualty costs blunt a key factor driving growth in many of these highgrowth markets lower costs of living if market growth slows fhns business will be impacted critical accounting policies estimates allowance for loan and lease losses managements policy is to maintain the alll at a level sufficient to absorb expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio management performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its loan and lease portfolio to identify trends and to assess the overall collectability of the portfolio management believes the accounting estimate related to the alll is a critical accounting estimate as changes in it can materially affect the provision for loan and lease losses and net income it requires management to predict borrowers likelihood or capacity to repay including evaluation of inherently uncertain future economic conditions prepayment activity must be projected to estimate the life of loans that often are shorter than contractual terms it requires estimation of a reasonable and supportable forecast period for credit losses for loan portfolio segments before reversion to historical loss levels over the remaining life of a loan and expected future recoveries of amounts previously charged off must be estimated accordingly this is a highly subjective process and requires significant judgment since it is difficult to evaluate current and future economic conditions in relation to an overall credit cycle and estimate the timing and extent of loss events that are expected to occur prior to the end of a loans and leases estimated life fhn believes that the principal assumptions underlying the accounting estimates made by management include the commercial loan portfolio has been properly risk graded based on information about borrowers in specific industries and specific issues with respect to single borrowers borrower specific information made available to fhn is current and accurate the loan portfolio has been segmented properly and individual loans have similar credit risk characteristics and will behave similarly the lives for loan portfolio pools have been estimated properly including consideration of expected prepayments the economic forecasts utilized and associated weighting selected by management in the modeling of expected credit losses are reflective of future economic conditions entityspecific historical loss information has been properly assessed for all loan portfolio segments as the initial basis for estimating expected credit losses the reasonable and supportable periods for loan portfolio segments have been properly determined the reversion methodologies and timeframes for migration from the reasonable and supportable period to the use of historical loss rates are reasonable expected recoveries of prior charge off amounts have been properly estimated and qualitative adjustments to modeled loss results reasonably reflect expected future credit losses as of the date of the financial statements while management uses the best information available to establish the alll future adjustments to the alll and methodology may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used n making the estimates such adjustments to prior estimates as necessary are made in the period in which these factors and other relevant considerations indicate that loss levels vary from previous estimates selection and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts are the most significant inputs in quantitative alll calculations due to the sensitivity of the alll determination to macroeconomic forecasts changes in those forecasts can result in materially different results between reporting periods in the determination of the alll as of december fhn utilized moodys baseline and s3 adverse scenarios for the calculation of the alll fhn placed the most weight on the moodys baseline scenario but included the s3 scenario to reflect the uncertainty of macroeconomic forecasts related to ongoing economic conditions due to the dynamic relationship of macroeconomic inputs in modeling calculations quantifying the effects of changing individual inputs is highly challenging additionally management applies judgment in developing qualitative adjustments that are considered necessary to appropriately reflect elements of credit risk that are not captured in the quantitative model results to provide some hypothetical sensitivity analysis fhn prepared two alternate quantitative calculations applying weighting to moodys baseline and s3 adverse scenarios these hypothetical calculations resulted in an reduction and increase respectively in alll in comparison to the alll recorded at december inclusive of qualitative adjustments that are affected by the weighting of forecast scenarios see note significant accounting policies and note allowance for credit losses for detail regarding fhns processes models and methodology for determining the alll income taxes fhn is subject to the income tax laws of the us and the states and jurisdictions in which it operates fhn accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc income taxes significant judgments and estimates are required in the determination of the consolidated income tax expense fhn income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid income tax expense consists of both current and deferred taxes current income tax expense is an estimate of taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and includes income tax expense related to uncertain tax positions a dta or a dtl is recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities deferred taxes can be affected by changes in tax rates applicable to future years either as a result of statutory changes or business changes that may change the jurisdictions in which taxes are paid additionally dtas are subject to a more likely than not test to determine whether the full amount of the dtas should be realized in the financial statements fhn evaluates the likelihood of realization of the dta based on both positive and negative evidence available at the time including as appropriate scheduled reversals of dtls projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial performance realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the carryforwards attributable to or generated with respect to the dta in projecting future taxable income fhn incorporates assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying business if the more likely than not test is not met a valuation allowance must be established against the dta the income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which fhn operate are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities in determining if a tax position should be recognized and in establishing a provision for income tax expense fhn must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws interpretations may be subjected to review during examination by taxing authorities and disputes may arise over the respective tax positions fhn attempts to resolve disputes that may arise during the tax examination and audit process however certain disputes may ultimately be resolved through the federal and state court systems fhn monitors relevant tax authorities and revises estimates of accrued income taxes on a quarterly basis changes in estimates may occur due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities revisions of estimates may also result from income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies revisions in estimates may be material to operating results for any given period see note income taxes for additional information including discussion of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets and the potential impact of unrecognized tax benefits on future earnings contingent liabilities a liability is contingent if the amount or outcome is not presently known but may become known in the future as a result of the occurrence of some uncertain future event fhn estimates its contingent liabilities based on managements estimates about the probability of outcomes and their ability to estimate the range of exposure accounting standards require that a liability be recorded if management determines that it is probable that a loss has occurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated in addition it must be probable that the loss will be confirmed by some future event as part of the estimation process management is required to make assumptions about matters that are by their nature highly uncertain and difficult to estimate the assessment of contingent liabilities including legal contingencies involves the use of critical estimates assumptions and judgments managements estimates are based on their belief that future events will validate the current assumptions regarding the ultimate outcome of these exposures however there can be no assurance that future events such as court decisions or decisions of arbitrators will not differ from managements assessments whenever practicable management consults with thirdparty experts eg attorneys accountants claims administrators etc to assist with the gathering and evaluation of information related to contingent liabilities based on internally andor externally prepared evaluations management makes a determination whether the potential exposure requires accrual in the financial statements see note contingencies and other disclosures for additional information
