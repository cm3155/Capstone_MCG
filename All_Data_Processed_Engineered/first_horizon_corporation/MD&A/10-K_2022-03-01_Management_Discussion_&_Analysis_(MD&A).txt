billion or commercial loan growth was tempered by a decrease of billion in loans to mortgage companies and a decrease of million in ppp loans periodend deposits of billion decreased billion or from december driven by a billion decrease in interestbearing deposits and a billion decrease in noninterestbearing deposits the decline in deposit balances largely reflects the continued downward trend from mid2021 highs driven by elevated liquidity related to the covid19 pandemic tier riskbased capital and total riskbased capital ratios at december were and respectively compared to and at december the cet1 ratio was at december compared to at december net interest income net interest income is fhns largest source of revenue and is the difference between the interest earned on interestearning assets generally loans leases and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities generally deposits and borrowed funds the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on average interestearning assets and the effective cost of interestbearing liabilities these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the frb and market interest rates net interest income of billion in increased million or from largely driven by higher earning asset yields partially offset by higher interestbearing liability costs fhns net interest margin increased basis points to in compared to and the net interest spread increased basis points to over the same period net interest margin and net interest spread were favorably impacted by a basis point increase in earning asset yields largely reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and lower levels of excess cash the higher yield on earning assets was partially offset by a basis point increase in the cost of interestbearing liabilities largely driven by higher deposit costs total average earning assets decreased billion in largely from a decrease in interestbearing deposits with banks partially offset by an increase in investment securities the following table presents the major components of net interest income and net interest margin provision for credit losses provision for credit losses includes the provision for loan and lease losses and the provision for unfunded lending commitments the provision for credit losses is the expense necessary to maintain the alll and the accrual for unfunded lending commitments at levels appropriate to absorb managements estimate of credit losses expected over the life of the loan and lease portfolio and the portfolio of unfunded loan commitments provision for credit losses increased to million in compared to a benefit of million in the increase in provision during was

effective tax rate also may be affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period such as changes in unrecognized tax benefits the rate also may be affected by items resulting from business combinations a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement

loss on retirement of legacy ibkc trust preferred securities in the million gain on sale of the title services business in and higher securities gains these increases were partially offset by lower deferred compensation income of million noninterest expense of million for decreased million compared to largely reflecting lower deferred compensation expense in the current year as well as the impact of impairments on longlived assets related to acquisition integration efforts in merger and integration expenses were million compared to million in because of various factors the contractual maturities of consumer loans are not indicative of the actual lives of such loans a significant component of fhns loan portfolio consists of consumer real estate loans a majority of which are home equity lines of credit and home equity installment loans these loans have an initial period where the borrower is only required to pay the periodic interest after the interestonly period the loan will require the payment of both principal and interest over the remaining term numerous factors can contribute to the actual life of a home equity line or installment loan as a result the actual average life of home equity lines and loans is difficult to predict and changes in any of these factors could result in changes in projections of average lives loans held for sale in fhn obtained ibkcs mortgage banking operations which includes origination and servicing of residential first lien mortgages that conform to standards established by gses that are major investors in us home mortgages but can also consist of junior lien and jumbo loans secured by residential property these nonconforming loans are primarily sold to private companies that are unaffiliated with the gses on a servicingreleased basis for further detail see note mortgage banking activity the legacy fhn loans hfs portfolio consists of small business other consumer loans mortgage warehouse usda and home equity loans on december loans hfs were million a million decrease compared to december largely driven by lower mortgage origination volume given the impact of higher longterm rates heldforsale consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate in process of foreclosure totaled million for both december and asset quality loan and lease portfolio composition fhn groups its loans into portfolio segments based on internal classifications reflecting the manner in which the alll is established and how credit risk is measured monitored and reported from time to time and if conditions are such that certain subsegments are uniquely affected by economic or market conditions or are experiencing greater deterioration than other components of the loan portfolio management may determine the alll at a more granular level commercial loans are composed of ci loans and cre loans consumer loans are composed of consumer real estate loans and credit card and other loans fhn has a concentration of residential real estate loans of and of total loans in and respectively industry concentrations are discussed under the ci heading below underwriting policies and procedures the following sections describe each portfolio as well as general underwriting procedures for each as economic and real estate conditions develop enhancements to underwriting and credit policies and procedures may be necessary or desirable loan policies and procedures for all portfolios are reviewed by credit risk working groups and management risk committees comprised of business line managers and credit administration professionals as well as by various other reviewing bodies within fhn policies and procedures are approved by key executives andor senior managers leading the applicable credit risk working groups as well as by management risk committees the credit risk working groups and management risk committees strive to ensure that the approved policies and procedures address the associated risks and establish reasonable underwriting criteria that appropriately mitigate risk policies and procedures are reviewed revised and reissued periodically at established review dates or earlier if changes in the economic environment portfolio performance the size of portfolio or industry concentrations or regulatory guidance warrant an earlier review commercial loan and lease portfolios fhns commercial loan approval process grants lending authority based upon job description experience and performance the lending authority is delegated to the business line market managers departmental managers regional presidents relationship managers rm and portfolio managers pm and to credit risk managers while individual limits vary the predominant amount of approval authority is vested with the credit risk management function portfolio industry and borrower concentration limits for the various portfolios are established by executive management and approved by the risk committee of the board fhns commercial lending process incorporates an rm and a pm for most commercial credits the rm is primarily responsible for communications with the borrower and maintaining the relationship while the pm is responsible for assessing the credit quality of the borrower beginning with the initial underwriting and continuing through the servicing period other specialists and the assigned rmpm are organized into units called deal teams deal teams are constructed with specific job attributes that facilitate fhns ability to identify mitigate document and manage ongoing risk pms and credit analysts provide enhanced analytical support during loan origination and servicing including monitoring of the financial condition of the borrower and tracking compliance with loan agreements loan closing officers and the construction loan management unit specialize in loan documentation and the management of the construction lending process fhn strives to identify problem assets early through comprehensive policies and guidelines targeted portfolio reviews more frequent servicing on lower rated borrowers and an emphasis on frequent grading for smaller commercial credits generally million or less and incomeproducing cre credits greater than million to nonprofessional real estate developers and smaller professional real estate investorsdevelopers fhn utilizes a centralized underwriting unit in order to originate and grade small business loans more efficiently and consistently fhn may utilize availability of guarantorssponsors to support commercial lending decisions during the credit underwriting process and when determining the assignment of internal loan grades reliance on the guaranty as a viable secondary source of repayment is a function of an analysis proving capability to pay factoring in among other things liquidity and directindirect cash flows fhn also considers the volume and amount of guaranties provided for all global indebtedness and the likelihood of realization fhn presumes a guarantors willingness to perform until there is any current or prior indication or future expectation that the guarantor may not willingly and voluntarily perform under the terms of the guaranty in fhns risk grading approach it is deemed that financial support becomes necessary generally at a point when the loan would otherwise be graded substandard reflecting a welldefined weakness at that point provided willingness and capacity to support are appropriately demonstrated a strong legally enforceable guaranty can mitigate the risk of default or loss justify a less severe rating and consequently reduce the level of allowance or chargeoff that might otherwise be deemed appropriate ci the ci portfolio totaled billion and billion as of december and respectively and is comprised of loans used for general business purposes products offered in the ci portfolio include term loan financing of owneroccupied real estate and fixed assets direct financing and salestype leases working capital lines of credit and trade credit enhancement through letters of credit incomeproducing ci loans are underwritten in accordance with a welldefined credit origination process this process includes applying minimum underwriting standards as well as separation of origination and credit approval roles on transaction sizes over pm authorization limits underwriting typically includes due diligence of the borrower and the applicable industry of the borrower analysis of the borrowers available financial information identification and analysis of the various sources of repayment and identification of the primary risk attributes stress testing the borrowers financial capacity adherence to loan documentation requirements and assigning credit risk grades using internally developed scorecards are also used to help quantify the risk when appropriate underwriting parameters also include loantovalue ratios which vary depending on collateral type use of guaranties loan agreement requirements and other recommended terms such as equity requirements amortization and maturity approval decisions also consider various financial ratios and performance measures of the borrowers such as cash flow and balance sheet leverage liquidity coverage of fixed charges and working capital additionally approval decisions consider the capital structure of the borrower sponsorship and qualityvalue of collateral generally guideline and policy exceptions are identified and mitigated during the approval process pricing of ci loans is based upon the determined credit risk specific to the individual borrower historically these loans typically have had variable rates tied to the libor or prime rate of interest plus or minus the appropriate margin however with the cessation of libor fhn no longer references libor in new loan contracts and the existing portfolio of loans tied to libor is being repriced to alternative reference rates excluding ppp loans ci growth was billion or the largest geographical concentrations of balances as of december were in tennessee florida texas north carolina louisiana california and georgia with no other state representing more than of the portfolio the following table provides the composition of the ci portfolio by industry as of december and for purposes of this disclosure industries are determined based on the naics industry codes used by federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the collection analysis and publication of statistical data related to the us business economy industry concentrations loan concentrations are considered to exist for a financial institution when there are loans to numerous borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions loans to mortgage companies and borrowers in the finance and insurance industry were of fhns ci loan portfolio as of december and as a result could be affected by items that uniquely impact the financial services industry as of december fhn did not have any other concentrations of ci loans in any single industry of or more of total loans loans to mortgage companies loans to mortgage companies include nonrevolving commercial lines of credit to qualified mortgage companies primarily for the temporary warehousing of eligible mortgage loans prior to the borrowers sale of those mortgage loans to third party investors loans to mortgage companies were of the ci portfolio as of december and of the ci portfolio as of december this portfolio generally fluctuates with mortgage rates and seasonal factors and includes balances related to both home purchase and refinance activity generally new loan originations to mortgage lenders increase when there is a decline in mortgage rates and decrease when rates rise in rates rose in periods of economic uncertainty this trend may not occur even if interest rates are declining in approximately of the loan originations were home purchases and were refinance transactions finance and insurance the finance and insurance component represented of the ci portfolio as of december compared to at the end of and includes trups ie longterm unsecured loans to bank and insurancerelated businesses loans to bank holding companies and assetbased lending to consumer finance companies as of december assetbased lending to consumer finance companies represents approximately billion of the finance and insurance component paycheck protection program in congress created the paycheck protection program ppp in response to the economic disruption associated with the covid19 pandemic under the ppp qualifying businesses could receive loans from private lenders such as fhn that are fully guaranteed by the small business administration these loans potentially are partly or fully forgivable depending upon the borrowers use of the funds and maintenance of employment levels to the extent forgiven the borrower is relieved from payment while the lender is still paid from the program as of december and the ci portfolio included million and billion respectively in ppp loans due to the government guarantee and forgiveness provisions ppp loans are considered to have no credit risk and do not affect the amount of provision and alll recorded as a result no alll was recorded for ppp loans as of december and and for regulatory capital purposes these loans have been assigned a risk weight of zero for these loans there were remaining net lender fees of less than million to be paid to fhn as of december during fhn continued to work with its clients that have applied for and received ppp loan forgiveness through december over billion of the original billion in ppp loans originated by fhn and by iberiabank prior to the merger had been forgiven by the sba commercial real estate the cre portfolio totaled billion as of december a billion or increase compared to december the cre portfolio includes both financings for commercial construction and nonconstruction loans this portfolio contains loans draws on lines and letters of credit to commercial real estate developers for the construction and minipermanent financing of incomeproducing real estate residential cre loans include loans to residential builders and developers for the purpose of constructing singlefamily homes condominiums and town homes and on a limited basis for developing residential subdivisions after the fulfillment of existing commitments over the near term the residential cre class will be in a winddown state with the expectation of full runoff in the foreseeable future incomeproducing cre loans incomeproducing cre loans are underwritten in accordance with credit policies and underwriting guidelines that are reviewed at least annually and revised as necessary based on market conditions loans are underwritten based upon project type size location sponsorship and other marketspecific data generally minimum requirements for equity debt service coverage ratios and level of preleasing activity are established based on perceived risk in each subcategory loantovalue value is defined as the lower of cost or market limits are set below regulatory prescribed ceilings and generally range between and depending on the underlying product set term and amortization requirements are set based on prudent standards for interim real estate lending equity requirements are established based on the quality and liquidity of the primary source of repayment for example more equity would be required for a speculative construction project or land loan than for a property fully leased to a credit tenant or a roster of tenants typically a borrower must have at least of cost invested in a project before fhn will provide loan funding income properties are required to achieve a debt service coverage ratio greater than or equal to at inception or stabilization of the project based on loan amortization and a minimum underwriting interest rate some product types that possess a greater risk profile require a higher level of equity as well as a higher debt service coverage ratio threshold a proprietary minimum underwriting interest rate is used to calculate compliance with underwriting standards generally specific levels of preleasing must be met for construction loans on income properties a global cash flow analysis is performed at the sponsor level a large minority of the portfolio is on a floating rate basis tied to libor however since january no new loan contracts reference libor and the existing portfolio of loans tied to libor is being repriced to alternative reference rates the credit administration and ongoing monitoring consists of multiple internal control processes construction loans are closed by a centralized control unit and construction loan management is administered centrally for loans million and over underwriters and credit approval personnel stress the borrowersprojects financial capacity utilizing numerous attributes such as interest rates vacancy and discount rates key information is captured from the various portfolios and then stressed at the aggregate level results are utilized to assist with the assessment of the adequacy of the alll and to steer portfolio management strategies the largest geographical concentrations of cre balances as of december were in florida texas north carolina georgia louisiana and tennessee with no other state representing more than of the portfolio subcategories of incomeproducing cre loans consist of multifamily office retail industrial hospitality landland development and other consumer loan portfolios consumer real estate the consumer real estate portfolio is primarily composed of home equity lines and installment loans this portfolio totaled billion as of december and billion as of december the largest geographical concentrations of balances in the consumer real estate portfolio as of december were in florida tennessee louisiana texas north carolina and new york with no other state representing more than of the portfolio as of december approximately of the consumer real estate portfolio was in a first lien position as of december the weighted average fico score at origination of this portfolio was and the refreshed fico scores averaged no significant change from fico scores of and respectively as of december generally performance of this portfolio is affected by life events that affect borrowers finances the level of unemployment and home prices as of december and fhn had heldtomaturity consumer mortgage loans secured by real estate totaling million and million respectively that were in the process of foreclosure helocs comprised billion of the consumer real estate portfolio for both december and december fhns helocs typically have a or year draw period followed by a or year repayment period respectively during the draw period a borrower is able to draw on the line and is only required to make interest payments the line is frozen if a borrower becomes past due on payments once the draw period has concluded the line is closed and the borrower is required to make both principal and interest payments monthly until the loan matures the principal payment generally is fully amortizing but payment amounts will adjust when variable rates reset to reflect changes in the prime rate as of december approximately of fhns helocs were in the draw period compared to at the end of based on when draw periods are scheduled to end per the line agreement it is expected that million or of helocs currently in the draw period will enter the repayment period during the next months based on current terms generally delinquencies for helocs that have entered the repayment period are initially higher than helocs still in the draw period because of the increased minimum payment requirement however over time performance of these loans usually begins to stabilize helocs nearing the end of the draw period are closely monitored the following table shows the helocs currently in the draw period and expected timing of conversion to the repayment period underwriting for the majority of loans in this portfolio underwriting decisions are made through a centralized loan underwriting center to obtain a consumer real estate loan the loan applicants in most cases must first meet a minimum qualifying fico score minimum fico score requirements are established by management for both loans secured by real estate as well as nonreal estate loans management also establishes maximum loan amounts loantovalue ratios and debttoincome ratios for each consumer real estate product applicants must have the financial capacity or available income to service the debt by not exceeding a calculated debttoincome ratio the amount of the loan is limited to a percentage of the lesser of the current appraised value or sales price of the collateral identified guideline and policy exceptions require established mitigating factors that have been approved for use by credit risk management heloc interest rates are variable and adjust with movements in the index rate stated in the loan agreement such loans can have elevated risks of default particularly in a rising interest rate environment potentially stressing borrower capacity to repay the loan at the higher interest rate fhns current underwriting practice requires heloc borrowers to qualify based on a sensitized interest rate above the current note rate fully amortized payment methodology fhns underwriting guidelines require borrowers to qualify at an interest rate that is basis points above the note rate this mitigates risk to fhn in the event of a sharp rise in interest rates over a relatively short time horizon heloc portfolio risk management fhn performs continuous heloc account reviews in order to identify higherrisk home equity lines and initiate preventative and corrective actions the reviews consider a number of account activity patterns and characteristics such as the number of times delinquent within recent periods changes in credit bureau score since origination score degradation performance of the first lien and account utilization in accordance with fhns interpretation of regulatory guidance fhn may block future draws on accounts in order to mitigate risk of loss to fhn credit card and other the credit card and other consumer loan portfolio totaled million as of december and million as of december this portfolio primarily consists of consumerrelated credits including home equity and other personal consumer loans credit card receivables and automobile loans the million decrease was driven by net repayments allowance for credit losses the acl is maintained at a level sufficient to provide appropriate reserves to absorb estimated future credit losses in accordance with gaap for additional information regarding the acl see notes and of this report the alll was million as of december or of total loans and leases compared to million or of total loans and leases at the end of the acl to total loans and leases ratio decreased to as of december from as of december troubled debt restructuring and loan modifications as part of fhns ongoing risk management practices fhn attempts to work with borrowers when appropriate to extend or modify loan terms to better align with their current ability to repay extensions and modifications to loans are made in accordance with internal policies and guidelines which conform to regulatory guidance each occurrence is unique to the borrower and is evaluated separately in a situation where an economic concession has been granted to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty fhn identifies and reports that loan as a tdr loan modifications made during that met the tdr relief provisions outlined in either the cares act as extended by the caa or revised interagency guidance are excluded from consideration as a tdr and are therefore excluded from designation as a tdr in the information and discussion that follows see note significant accounting policies and note loans and leases for further discussion regarding tdrs and loan modifications commercial loan modifications as part of fhns credit risk management governance processes the loan rehab and recovery department lrrd is responsible for managing most commercial relationships with borrowers whose financial condition has deteriorated to such an extent that the credits are being considered for impairment classified as substandard or worse placed on nonaccrual status foreclosed or in process of foreclosure or in active or contemplated litigation lrrd has the authority and responsibility to enter into workout andor rehabilitation agreements with troubled commercial borrowers in order to mitigate andor minimize the amount of credit losses recognized from these problem assets while every circumstance is different lrrd will generally use forbearance agreements generally months as an element of commercial loan workouts which might include reduced interest rates reduced payments release of guarantor or entering into short sale agreements the individual impairment assessments completed on commercial loans in accordance with the accounting standards codification topic related to troubled debt restructurings asc include loans classified as tdrs as well as loans that may have been modified yet not classified as tdrs by management for example a modification of loan terms that management would generally not consider to be a tdr could be a temporary extension of maturity to allow a borrower to complete an asset sale whereby the proceeds of such transaction are to be paid to satisfy the outstanding debt additionally a modification that extends the term of a loan but does not involve reduction of principal or accrued interest in which the interest rate is adjusted to reflect current market rates for similarly situated borrowers is not considered a tdr nevertheless each assessment will take into account any modified terms and will be comprehensive to ensure appropriate impairment assessment if individual impairment is identified management will either hold specific reserves on the amount of impairment or if the loan is collateral dependent write down the carrying amount of the asset to the net realizable value of the collateral consumer loan modifications fhn does not currently participate in any of the loan modification programs sponsored by the us government but does generally structure modified consumer loans using the parameters of the former home affordable modification program generally a majority of loans modified under any such proprietary programs are classified as tdrs within the heloc and real estate installment loans classes of the consumer portfolio segment tdrs are typically modified by reducing the interest rate in increments of basis points to a minimum of for up to years and a possible maturity date extension to reach an affordable housing debttoincome ratio after years the interest rate generally returns to the original interest rate prior to modification for certain modifications the modified interest rate increases per year until the original interest rate prior to modification is achieved permanent mortgage tdrs are typically modified by reducing the interest rate in increments of basis points to a minimum of for up to years and a possible maturity date extension to reach an affordable housing debttoincome ratio after years the interest rate steps up percent every year until it reaches the federal home loan mortgage corporation weekly survey rate cap contractual maturities may be extended to years on permanent mortgages and to years for consumer real estate loans within the credit card class of the consumer portfolio segment tdrs are typically modified through either a shortterm credit card hardship program or a longerterm credit card workout program in the credit card hardship program borrowers may be granted rate and payment reductions for months to year in the credit card workout program clients are granted a rate reduction to and term extensions for up to years to pay off the remaining balance following classification as a tdr modified loans within the consumer portfolio which were previously evaluated for impairment on a collective basis determined by their smaller balances and homogenous nature become subject to the impairment guidance in asc which requires individual evaluation of the debt for impairment however as applicable accounting guidance allows fhn may aggregate certain smallerbalance homogeneous tdrs and use historical statistics such as aggregated chargeoff amounts and average amounts recovered along with a composite effective interest rate to measure impairment when such impaired loans have risk characteristics in common fhn had million and million in heldforinvestment tdrs as of december and respectively for these tdrs fhn had an allowance for loan and lease losses of million for both periods including specific reserves or and of tdr balances as of december and respectively additionally fhn had million and million of hfs loans classified as tdrs as of december and respectively the following table provides a summary of tdrs for the periods ended december and shortterm borrowings shortterm borrowings include federal funds purchased securities sold under agreements to repurchase trading liabilities and other shortterm borrowings total shortterm borrowings were billion and billion as of december and december respectively shortterm borrowings balances fluctuate largely based on the level of fhlb borrowing as a result of loan demand deposit levels and balance sheet funding strategies trading liabilities fluctuate based on various factors including levels of trading securities and hedging strategies federal funds purchased fluctuates depending on the amount of excess funding of fhns correspondent bank customers balances of securities sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate based on cost attractiveness relative to fhlb borrowing levels and the ability to pledge securities toward such transactions see note shortterm borrowings for additional information term borrowings term borrowings include senior and subordinated borrowings with original maturities greater than one year total term borrowings were billion as of both december and december see note term borrowings for additional information banking regulators define minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries based on the capital rules and definitions prescribed by the banking regulators should any depository institutions capital ratios decline below predetermined levels it would become subject to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions the system categorizes a depository institutions capital position into one of five categories ranging from wellcapitalized to critically undercapitalized for an institution the size of fhn to qualify as wellcapitalized common equity tier tier capital total capital and leverage capital ratios must be at least and respectively furthermore a capital conservation buffer of basis points above these levels must be maintained on the common equity tier tier capital and total capital ratios to avoid restrictions on dividends share repurchases and certain discretionary bonuses as of december both fhn and first horizon bank had sufficient capital to qualify as wellcapitalized institutions and to meet the capital conservation buffer requirement capital ratios for both fhn and first horizon bank as of december are calculated under the final rule issued by the banking regulators in to delay the effects of cecl on regulatory capital for two years followed by a threeyear transition period for fhn the tier and total riskbased regulatory capital ratios increased in relative to primarily from the impact of net income less dividends fhns tier capital and tier leverage ratios further benefited from the issuance of its series g preferred stock in february fhn and first horizon banks riskbased regulatory capital ratios were negatively impacted in from an increase in riskweighted assets from december during capital ratios are expected to remain above wellcapitalized standards plus the required capital conservation buffer for fhn and first horizon bank completed a company run stress test using the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar resubmission scenarios published in february results of these tests indicate that both fhn and first horizon bank would be able to maintain capital well in excess of basel iii adequately capitalized standards under the hypothetical severe global recession of the ccar resubmission severely adverse scenario a summary of those results was posted in the events presentations

anticipates that it will continue performing an annual enterprisewide stress test as part of its capital and risk management process results of this test will be presented to executive management and the board the disclosures in this stress testing section include forwardlooking statements please refer to forwardlooking statements for additional information concerning the characteristics and limitations of statements of that type common stock purchase programs pursuant to board authority fhn may repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time and will evaluate the level of capital and take action designed to generate or use capital as appropriate for the interests of the shareholders subject to legal and regulatory restrictions fhns board has not authorized a preferred stock purchase program general purchase program on january fhn announced that its board approved a new million common share purchase program that was to expire on january on october fhn announced that the program had been increased by million and extended to october the program is not tied to any compensation plan purchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions including under rule 10b51 plans as well as accelerated share repurchase and other structured transactions the timing and exact amount of common share repurchases will be subject to various factors including fhns capital position financial performance capital impacts of strategic initiatives market conditions and regulatory considerations as of december million in purchases had been made lifetodate under the program at an average price per share of or excluding commissions at current price levels which have been impacted by the pending td merger since it was announced management does not currently anticipate purchasing additional shares under this authority compensation plans purchase program a consolidated compensation plan share purchase program was announced on august this program consolidated into a single share purchase program all of the previously authorized compensation plan share programs as well as the renewal of the authorization to purchase shares for use in connection with two compensation plans for which the share purchase authority had expired the total amount authorized under this consolidated compensation plan share purchase program is million shares calculated before adjusting for stock dividends distributed through january the authorization has been reduced for that portion which relates to compensation plans for which no options remain outstanding the shares may be purchased over the option exercise period of the various compensation plans on or before december purchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and are subject to various factors including fhns capital position financial performance capital impacts of strategic initiatives market conditions and regulatory restrictions as of december the risk management fhn derives revenue from providing services and in many cases assuming and managing risk for profit which exposes fhn to business strategy and reputational liquidity market capital adequacy operational compliance legal and credit risks that require ongoing oversight and management fhn has an enterprisewide approach to risk governance measurement management and reporting including an economic capital allocation process that is tied to risk profiles used to measure riskadjusted returns through an enterprisewide risk governance structure and a risk appetite statement approved by the board management continually evaluates the balance of riskreturn and earnings volatility with shareholder value fhns enterprisewide risk governance structure begins with the board the board working with the risk committee of the board establishes fhns risk appetite by approving policies and limits that provide standards for the nature and the level of risk fhn is willing to assume the board regularly receives reports on managements performance against fhns risk appetite primarily through the boards risk and audit committees to further support the risk governance provided by the board fhn has established accountabilities control processes procedures and a management governance structure designed to align risk management with risktaking throughout fhn the control procedures are aligned with fhns four components of risk governance specific risk committees the risk management organization business unit risk management and independent assurance functions 1specific risk committees the board has delegated authority to the chief executive officer to manage business strategy and reputation risk and the general business affairs of fhn under the boards oversight the ceo utilizes the executive management team and the management risk committee to carry out these duties and to analyze existing and emerging strategic and reputation risks and determines the appropriate course of action the management risk committee is comprised of the ceo and certain officers designated by the ceo the management risk committee is supported by a set of specific risk committees focused on unique risk types eg liquidity credit operational etc these risk committees provide a mechanism that assembles the necessary expertise and perspectives of the management team to discuss emerging risk issues monitor fhns risktaking activities and evaluate specific transactions and exposures these committees also monitor the direction and trend of risks relative to business strategies and market conditions and direct management to respond to risk issues 2the risk management organization fhns risk management organization led by the chief risk officer and chief credit officer provides objective oversight of risktaking activities the risk management organization translates fhns overall risk appetite into approved limits and formal policies and is supported by corporate staff functions including the corporate secretary legal finance human resources and technology risk management also works with business units and functional experts to establish appropriate operating standards and monitor business practices in relation to those standards additionally risk management proactively works with business units and senior management to focus management on key risks in fhn and emerging trends that may change fhns risk profile the chief risk officer has overall responsibility and accountability for enterprise risk management and aggregate risk reporting 3business unit risk management fhns business units are responsible for identifying acknowledging quantifying mitigating and managing all risks arising within their respective units they determine and execute their business strategies which puts them closest to the changing nature of risks and they are best able to take the needed actions to manage and mitigate those risks the business units are supported by the risk management organization that helps identify and consider risks when making business decisions management processes structure and policies are designed to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations as well as provide organizational clarity for authority decisionmaking and accountability the risk governance structure supports and promotes the escalation of material items to executive management and the board 4independent assurance functions internal audit credit assurance services cas compliance testing and model validation provide an independent and objective assessment of the design and execution of fhns internal control system including management processes risk governance and policies and procedures these groups activities are designed to provide reasonable assurance that risks are appropriately identified and communicated resources are safeguarded significant financial managerial and operating information is complete accurate and reliable and employee actions are in compliance with fhns policies and applicable laws and regulations internal audit and cas report to the chief audit executive who is appointed by and reports to the audit committee of the board internal audit reports quarterly to the audit committee of the board while cas reports quarterly to the risk committee of the board compliance testing and model validation report to the chief risk officer and report annually to the audit committee of the board market risk management market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions will adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities or otherwise negatively impact fhns earnings market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with fhns operations primarily trading activities within fhn financial but also through nontrading activities which are primarily affected by interest rate risk that is managed by the alco within fhn fhn is exposed to market risk related to the trading securities inventory and loans held for sale maintained by fhn financial in connection with its fixed income distribution activities various types of securities inventory positions are procured for distribution to clients by the sales staff when these securities settle on a delayed basis they are considered forward contracts refer to the determination of fair value trading securities and trading liabilities section of note fair value of assets and liabilities which section is incorporated into this mda by this reference fhns market risk appetite is approved by the risk committee of the board of directors and executed through management policies and procedures of alco and the fhn financial risk committee these policies contain various market risk limits including for example var limits for the trading securities inventory and individual position limits and sector limits for products with credit risk among others risk measures are computed and reviewed on a daily basis to ensure compliance with market risk management policies valueatrisk and stress testing var is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss in value from adverse market movements over an assumed fixed holding period within a stated confidence level fhn employs a model to compute daily var measures for its trading securities inventory fhn computes var using historical simulation with a 1year lookback period at a confidence level with 1day and 10day time horizons additionally fhn computes a stressed var measure the svar computation uses the same model but with model inputs reflecting historical data from a continuous 12month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate for our trading securities portfolio a summary of fhns var and svar measures for 1day and 10day time horizons is presented in the following table the potential risk of loss reflected by fhns var measures assumes the trading securities inventory is static because fhn financial procures fixed income securities for purposes of distribution to clients its trading securities inventory turns over regularly additionally fhnf traders actively manage the trading securities inventory continuously throughout each trading day accordingly fhnfs trading securities inventory is highly dynamic rather than static as a result it would be rare for fhnf to incur a negative revenue day in its fixed income activities at the levels indicated by its var measures in addition to being used in fhns daily market risk management process the var and svar measures are also used by fhn in computing its regulatory market risk capital requirements in accordance with the market risk capital rules for additional information regarding fhns capital adequacy refer to the capital section of this mda fhn also performs stress tests on its trading securities portfolio to calculate the potential loss under various assumed market scenarios key assumed stresses used in those tests are down bps assumes an instantaneous downward move in interest rates of basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve up bps assumes an instantaneous upward move in interest rates of basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve curve flattening assumes an instantaneous flattening of the interest rate yield curve through an increase in shortterm rates and a decrease in longterm rates the 2year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to increase basis points and the 10year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease basis points shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2year and 10year points curve steepening assumes an instantaneous steepening of the interest rate yield curve through a decrease in shortterm rates and an increase in long term rates the 2year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease basis points and the 10year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to increase basis points shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2year and 10year points credit spread widening assumes an instantaneous increase in credit spreads the difference between yields on treasury securities and nontreasury securities of basis points model validation trading risk management personnel within fhn financial have primary responsibility for model risk management with respect to the model used by fhn to compute its var measures and perform stress testing on the trading inventory among other procedures these personnel monitor model results and perform periodic backtesting as part of an ongoing process of validating the accuracy of the model these model risk management activities are subject to annual review by fhns model validation group an independent assurance group charged with oversight responsibility for fhns model risk management interest rate risk management interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movement in interest rates alco is responsible for overseeing the management of existing and emerging interest rate risk for the company within risk tolerances established by the board fhn primarily manages interest rate risk by structuring the balance sheet to maintain a desired level of associated earnings and to protect the economic value of fhns capital net interest income and the value of equity are affected by changes in the level of market interest rates because of the differing repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities the exercise of prepayment options held by loan clients the early withdrawal options held by deposit clients and changes in the basis between and changing shapes of the various yield curves used to price assets and liabilities to isolate the repricing basis option and yield curve components of overall interest rate risk fhn employs gap earnings at risk and economic value of equity analyses generated by a balance sheet simulation model net interest income simulation analysis the information provided in this section including the discussion regarding the outcomes of simulation analysis and rate shock analysis is forwardlooking actual results if the assumed scenarios were to occur could differ because of interest rate movements the ability of management to execute its business plans and other factors including those presented in the forwardlooking statements section of this report management uses a simulation model to measure interest rate risk and to formulate strategies to improve balance sheet positioning earnings or both within fhns interest rate risk liquidity and capital guidelines interest rate exposure is measured by forecasting months of nii under various interest rate scenarios and comparing the percentage change in nii for each scenario to a base case scenario where interest rates remain unchanged assumptions are made regarding future balance sheet composition interest rate movements and loan and deposit pricing in addition assumptions are made about the magnitude of asset prepayments and earlier than anticipated deposit withdrawals the results of these scenarios help fhn develop strategies for managing exposure to interest rate risk while management believes the assumptions used and scenarios selected in its simulations are reasonable simulation modeling provides only an estimate not a precise calculation of exposure to any given change in interest rates based on a static balance sheet as of december nii exposures over the next months assuming rate shocks of plusminus basis points plusminus basis points plusminus basis points and plus basis points are estimated to have variances as shown in the table below a steepening yield curve scenario where longterm rates increase by basis points and shortterm rates are static results in a favorable nii variance of a flattening yield curve scenario where longterm rates decrease by basis points and shortterm rates are static results in an unfavorable nii variance of these hypothetical scenarios are used to create a risk measurement framework and do not necessarily represent managements current view of future interest rates or market developments fhns net interest income had been impacted by the disruption from the covid19 pandemic and its variants as well as the lowrate environment the impact of government stimulus programs and other developments continue to influence net interest income results although the impacts from these programs have abated the yield curve was inverted for much of the last half of which has continued into early the inverted yield curve indicates market expectations that short term rates are likely to peak and then decline in future periods market participants are divided in their opinions regarding the timing and magnitude of further short term rate increases or subsequent rate cuts fhn continues to monitor current economic trends and potential exposures closely fair value shock analysis interest rate risk and the slope of the yield curve also affect the fair value of fhns trading inventory that is reflected in noninterest income generally low or declining interest rates with a positively sloped yield curve tend to increase income through higher demand for fixed income products additionally the fair value of fhns trading inventory can fluctuate as a result of differences between current interest rates and the interest rates of fixed income securities in the trading inventory derivatives in the normal course of business fhn utilizes various financial instruments including derivative contracts and creditrelated agreements to manage the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of certain financial instruments generally caused by changes in interest rates including fhns securities inventory certain term borrowings and certain loans additionally fhn may enter into derivative contracts in order to meet clients needs however such derivative contracts are typically offset with a derivative contract entered into with an upstream counterparty in order to mitigate risk associated with changes in interest rates the simulation models and related hedging strategies discussed above exclude the dynamics related to how fee income and noninterest expense may be affected by actual changes in interest rates or expectations of changes see note derivatives for additional discussion of these instruments capital risk management adequacy the capital management objectives of fhn are to provide capital sufficient to cover the risks inherent in fhns businesses to maintain excess capital to wellcapitalized standards and board policy and to assure ready access to the capital markets the capital stress testing committee chaired by the corporate treasurer reports to alco and is responsible for capital management oversight and provides a forum for addressing management issues related to capital adequacy thiscommittee reviews sources and uses of capital key capital ratios segment economic capital allocation methodologies coordinates the annual enterprisewide stress testing process and considers other factors in monitoring and managing current capital levels as well as potential future sources and uses of capital the capital stress testing committee also recommends capital management policies which are submitted for approval to alco and the risk committee and the board as necessary operational risk management operational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes people or systems or from external events including data or network security breaches of fhn or of third parties affecting fhn or its clients this risk is inherent in all businesses operational risk is divided into the following risk areas which have been established at the corporate level to address these risks across the entire organization business resilience records management compliancelegal including bank secrecy act program governance fiduciary securityfraud financial including disclosure controls and procedures information technology including cybersecurity model vendor insurance management measurement and reporting of operational risk are overseen by the operational risk fiduciary financial governance fhn financial risk and strategic investment board committees key representatives from the business segments operating units and supporting units are represented on these committees as appropriate these governance committees manage the individual operational risk types across fhn by setting standards monitoring activity initiating actions and reporting exposures and results key committee activities and decisions are reported to the appropriate governance committee or included in the enterprise risk report a quarterly analysis of risk within the organization that is provided to the risk committee emphasis is dedicated to refinement of processes and tools to aid in measuring and managing material operational risks and providing for a culture of awareness and accountability compliance risk management compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions material financial loss or loss to reputation as a result of failure to comply with laws regulations rules selfregulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to fhns activities management measurement and reporting of compliance risk are overseen by the operational risk committee and other key corporate governance committees key executives from the business segments legal compliance risk management and service functions are represented on the committees summary reports of committee activities and decisions are provided to the appropriate governance committees reports include the status of regulatory activities internal compliance program initiatives compliance testing and internal audit results and evaluation of emerging compliance risk areas credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a borrowers or counterpartys ability to meet its financial obligations under agreed upon terms fhn is subject to credit risk in lending trading investing liquidityfunding and asset management activities although lending activities have the most exposure to credit risk the nature and amount of credit risk depends on the types of transactions the structure of those transactions collateral received the use of guarantors and the parties involved fhn assesses and manages credit risk through a series of policies processes measurement systems and controls the credit risk management committee is responsible for overseeing the management of existing and emerging credit risks in the company within the broad risk tolerances established by the board the crmc reports through the management risk committee the credit risk management function led by the chief credit officer provides strategic and tactical credit leadership by maintaining policies overseeing credit approval assessing new credit products strategies and processes and managing portfolio composition and performance while the credit risk function oversees fhns credit risk management there is significant coordination between the business lines and the credit risk function in order to manage fhns credit risk and maintain strong asset quality the credit risk function recommends portfolio industrysector and individual client limits to the risk committee of the board for approval adherence to these approved limits is vigorously monitored by credit risk which provides recommendations to slow or cease lending to the business lines as commitments near established lending limits credit risk also ensures subject matter experts are providing oversight support and credit approvals particularly in the specialty lending areas where industryspecific knowledge is required management emphasizes general portfolio servicing such that emerging risks are able to be spotted early enough to correct potential deficiencies prevent further credit deterioration and mitigate credit losses the credit risk management function assesses the asset quality trends and results as well as lending processes adherence to underwriting guidelines portfoliospecific underwriting guidelines are discussed further in the asset quality trends section and utilizes this information to inform management regarding the current state of credit quality and as a factor of the estimation process for determining the allowance for credit losses the crmc reviews on a periodic basis various reports issued by assurance functions which provide an independent assessment of the adequacy of loan servicing grading accuracy and other key functions additionally crmc is presented with and discusses various portfolios lending activity and lendingrelated projects all of the above activities are subject to independent review by fhns credit assurance services group cas reports to the chief audit executive who is appointed by and reports to the audit committee of the board and provides quarterly reports to the risk committee of the board cas is charged with providing the risk committee of the board and executive management with independent objective and timely assessments of fhns portfolio quality credit policies and credit risk management processes liquidity risk management among other things alco is responsible for liquidity management the funding of assets with liabilities of appropriate duration while mitigating the risk of unexpected cash needs alco and the board of directors have adopted a liquidity policy of which the objective is to ensure that fhn meets its cash and collateral obligations promptly in a costeffective manner and with the highest degree of reliability the maintenance of adequate levels of asset and liability liquidity should provide fhn with the ability to meet both expected and unexpected cash and collateral needs key liquidity ratios asset liquidity levels and the amount available from funding sources are reported to alco on a regular basis fhns liquidity policy establishes liquidity limits that are deemed appropriate for fhns risk profile in accordance with the liquidity policy alco manages fhns exposure to liquidity risk through a dynamic real time forecasting methodology base liquidity forecasts are reviewed by alco and are updated as financial conditions dictate in addition to the baseline liquidity reports robust stress testing of assumptions and funds availability are periodically reviewed fhn maintains a contingency funding plan that may be executed should unexpected difficulties arise in accessing funding that affects fhn the industry or both subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements from time to time funds are available from a number of sources including the availableforsale securities portfolio dealer and commercial customer repurchase agreements access to the overnight and term federal funds markets incremental borrowing capacity at the fhlb billion was available at december brokered deposits loan sales syndications and access to the federal reserve bank core deposits are a significant source of funding and have historically been a stable source of liquidity for banks generally core deposits represent funding from a financial institutions client base which provides inexpensive predictable pricing the ratio of average loans excluding loans hfs and restricted real estate loans to average core deposits was on december and on december fhn may also use unsecured shortterm borrowings as a source of liquidity federal funds purchased from correspondent bank clients are considered to be substantially more stable than funds purchased in the national broker markets for federal funds due to the long historical and reciprocal nature of banking services provided by fhn to these correspondent banks the remainder of fhns wholesale shortterm borrowings consists of securities sold under agreements to repurchase transactions accounted for as secured borrowings with business clients or broker dealer counterparties both fhn and first horizon bank have the ability to generate liquidity by issuing senior or subordinated unsecured debt preferred equity and common equity subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements in february fhn issued and sold to td  of series g perpetual convertible preferred stock in a private placement transaction for million as of december fhn had outstanding billion in senior and subordinated unsecured debt and billion in noncumulative perpetual preferred stock as of december first horizon bank and subsidiaries had outstanding preferred shares of million which are reflected as noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheet parent company liquidity is primarily provided by cash flows stemming from dividends and interest payments collected from subsidiaries these sources of cash represent the primary sources of funds to pay cash dividends to shareholders and principal and interest to debt holders of fhn the amount paid to the parent company through first horizon bank common dividends is managed as part of fhns overall cash management process subject to applicable regulatory restrictions certain regulatory restrictions exist regarding the ability of first horizon bank to transfer funds to fhn in the form of cash common dividends loans or advances at any given time the pertinent portions of those regulatory restrictions allow first horizon bank to declare preferred or common dividends without prior regulatory approval in an aggregate amount equal to first horizon banks retained net income for the two most recently completed years plus the current yeartodate period for any period first horizon banks retained net income generally is equal to first horizon banks regulatory net income reduced by the preferred and common dividends declared by first horizon bank applying the dividend restrictions imposed under applicable federal and state rules as outlined above the banks total amount available for dividends was million as of january consequently on that date the bank could pay common dividends up to that amount to its sole common shareholder fhn or to its preferred shareholders without prior regulatory approval additionally a capital conservation buffer must be maintained as described in the capital section of this report to avoid restrictions on dividends in march fhn agreed to suspend the dividend reinvestment plan in connection with the pending td merger as a result of the suspension of the plan participants in the plan received their first quarter fhn dividend paid on april in cash during the suspension period dividend payments of fhn will not be automatically reinvested in additional shares of fhn common stock and participants in the plan will be unable to purchase shares of fhn common stock through optional cash investments under the plan first horizon bank declared and paid common dividends to the parent company in the amount of million in and million in in january first horizon bank declared and paid a common dividend to the parent company in the amount of million first horizon bank paid preferred dividends in each quarter of and and declared preferred dividends in the first quarter of which are payable in april payment of a dividend to shareholders of fhn is dependent on several factors which are considered by the board these factors include fhns current and prospective capital liquidity and other needs applicable regulatory restrictions including capital conservation buffer requirements and availability of funds to fhn through a dividend from first horizon bank additionally banking regulators generally require insured banks and bank holding companies to pay cash dividends only out of current operating earnings consequently the decision of whether fhn will pay future dividends and the amount of dividends will be affected by current operating results fhn paid a cash dividend of per common share on january fhn paid cash dividends of per series e preferred share and per series f preferred share on january and per series b preferred share and per series c preferred share on february in addition in january the board approved cash dividends per share in the following amounts although we do not expect the pending td merger to be completed before march the common stock record date if it is the common stock dividend described above will not be paid the fhn preferred stock and the first horizon bank class a preferred stock will remain outstanding after the closing of the pending td merger if following the closing of the pending td merger td elects to effect the merger of fhn into td bank us holding company at the effective time of such merger each share of fhn preferred stock described above will be automatically converted into a share of a newly created corresponding series of preferred stock of td bank us holding company having terms that are not materially less favorable than those of the existing series of fhn preferred stock in addition following the closing of the pending td merger at the effective time of the merger of first horizon bank into tdbna each share of first horizon bank class a preferred stock will be automatically converted into a share of a newly created corresponding series of preferred stock of tdbna having terms that are not materially less favorable than those of the existing first horizon bank class a preferred stock the payment and timing of the dividends will not be impacted by any such conversion of the fhn preferred stock into td bank us holding company preferred stock or the first horizon bank class a preferred stock into tdbna preferred stock offbalance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business fhn is a party to a number of activities that contain credit market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the consolidated financial statements such activities include traditional offbalance sheet creditrelated financial instruments fhn enters into commitments to extend credit to borrowers including loan commitments lines of credit standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit many of the commitments are expected to expire unused or be only partially used therefore the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements and are not included in the table below based on its available liquidity and available borrowing capacity fhn anticipates it will continue to have sufficient funds to meet its current commitments see note contingencies and other disclosures for more information contractual obligations the following table sets forth contractual obligations representing required and potential cash outflows as of december purchase obligations represent obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on fhn and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction credit ratings fhn is currently able to fund a majority of the balance sheet through core deposits which are generally not as sensitive to fhns credit ratings as other types of funding however maintaining adequate credit ratings on debt issues and preferred stock is critical to liquidity should fhn need to access funding from other sources including from longterm debt issuances and certain brokered deposits at an attractive rate the availability and cost of funds other than core deposits is also dependent upon marketplace perceptions of the financial soundness of fhn which include such factors as capital levels asset quality and reputation the availability of core deposit funding is stabilized by federal deposit insurance which can be removed only in extraordinary circumstances but may also be influenced to some extent by the same factors that affect other funding sources fhns credit ratings are also referenced in various respects in agreements with certain derivative counterparties as discussed in note derivatives the following table provides fhns most recent credit ratings repurchase obligations prior to september legacy first horizon originated loans through its pre2009 mortgage business primarily first lien home loans with the intention of selling them as discussed in note contingencies and other disclosures fhns principal remaining exposures for those activities relate to i indemnification claims by underwriters loan purchasers and other parties which assert that fhnoriginated loans caused or contributed to losses which fhn is legally obliged to indemnify and ii indemnification or other claims related to fhns servicing of pre2009 mortgage loans fhns approach for determining the adequacy of the repurchase and foreclosure reserve has evolved sometimes substantially based on changes in information available repurchasemakewhole rates vary based on purchaser vintage and claim type for those loans repurchased or covered by a makewhole payment cumulative average loss severities range between and percent of the upb repurchase accrual approach in determining potential loss content claims are analyzed by purchaser vintage and claim type fhn considers various inputs including claim rate estimates historical average repurchase and loss severity rates mortgage insurance cancellations and mortgage insurance curtailment requests inputs are applied to claims in the active pipeline as well as to historical average inflows to estimate loss content related to potential future inflows management also evaluates the nature of claims from purchasers andor servicers of loans sold to determine if qualitative adjustments are appropriate repurchase and foreclosure liability fhns repurchase and foreclosure liability primarily related to its pre2009 mortgage business is comprised of accruals to cover estimated loss content in the active pipeline consisting of mortgage loan repurchase makewhole foreclosureservicing demands and certain related exposures estimated future inflows and estimated loss content related to certain known claims not currently included in the active pipeline the liability contemplates repurchasemakewhole and damages obligations and estimates for probable incurred losses associated with loan populations excluded from the settlements with the gses as well as other whole loans sold mortgage insurance cancellations rescissions and loans included in bulk servicing sales effected prior to the settlements with the gses fhn compares the estimated probable incurred losses determined under the applicable loss estimation approaches for the respective periods with current reserve levels changes in the estimated required liability levels are recorded as necessary through the repurchase and foreclosure provision the repurchase and foreclosure liability was million and million as of december and respectively market uncertainties and prospective trends fhns future results could be affected both positively and negatively by several known trends key among those are changes in the us and global economy and outlook government actions affecting interest rates and government actions and proposals which could have positive or negative impacts on the economy at large or on certain businesses industries or sectors additional risks relate to how the covid19 pandemic continues to affect fhns clients political uncertainty changes in federal policies including those publicly discussed formally proposed or recently implemented and the potential impacts of those changes on our businesses and clients and whether fhns strategic initiatives will succeed inflation recession and federal reserve policy economic overview the year and to date was marked by strong inflation which began in the federal reserve implementing a tightening policy to contain inflation by rapidly increasing shortterm interest rates and ending asset purchases many indicators suggesting nearterm recession continuing supplychain difficulties impacting many industries and low unemployment rates several aspects of these events were unusual although the us economy flirted with recession in it did not officially enter one instead economic growth fluttered above and below zero ending the year with very modest positive growth although recessionary expectations in were high much of the year those did not translate into large negative shifts in spending or employment recessionary expectations remain elevated early in but the range of expectations and uncertainty is wide historically while it is common for unemployment to rise only after a recession has begun it is unusual for unemployment to remain low in the context of the events in the unemployment rate remains historically very low with over million job openings reported in the us at the end of demand for labor remains strong if recessionary pressures continue to grow demand for labor eventually will abate however as showed it is not clear that recessionary expectations will be borne out in or if there is a recession that it will be typical amplifying inflationary pressures and general uncertainties the russian military invaded ukraine in february a year later that conflict continues much of europe and the rest of the world including the us imposed economic sanctions on russia for its attack its ongoing military campaign resulting in substantial civilian casualties and the manner in which it has prosecuted the war which reportedly has significantly violated several international conventions and treaties the war and sanctions resulted in global oil and gas prices rising precipitously in early along with the prices of several other commodities exported by russia ukraine or both including certain grains and vegetable oils oil prices have been volatile since then but have oscillated around much higher price levels than before the war federal reserve and rates the federal reserve raised shortterm rates several times in and again in january recent public comments indicate that further raises will continue in until inflation is judged to be adequately controlled the raises in were and basis points each which was aggressive by historical standards while the january raise was a moretypical basis points the federal reserve has expressed its intent to bring inflation under control even at the risk of creating or deepening an economic recession by raising rates the federal reserve intends to curb demand in the us for goods and services by making credit more expensive and reducing the amount of borrowed dollars generally if supplies remain constant curbing demand should curb inflation eventually fhn cannot predict exactly when or how much shortterm rates will be raised nor how marketdriven longterm rates will behave nor how those actions may affect financial markets during however currently fhn expects the federal reserve to adhere to its guidance and continue raising shortterm rates more specifically fhn believes that the inverted yield curve indicates that the market expects short term rates to be near a peak in contrast fhn anticipates short term rates will increase in small increments in and will not start to fall quickly yield curve during the yield curve flattened and modestly inverted at times in the first two quarters and was inverted much of the last two quarters unusual yield curve effects including inversion may continue in a traditional measure of inversion occurs when the twoyear us treasury rate is higher than the tenyear rate traditional inversion was sustained for most of the second half of which is very unusual sustained traditional yield curve inversion is viewed with statistical support as a harbinger of economic recession recession the us economy contracted experienced negative growth during the first two quarters of and expanded during the second two in all cases very modestly moreover the inflation rate was lower in the second half of the year than in the first although secondhalf us growth was a positive development and the inflation rate is decelerating inflation in the us remains persistently high and therefore the federal reserve is expected to continue to hike interest rates recession expectations in the us were high in and continue to be elevated in traditionally when people and businesses expect a recession they often change their behaviors in ways that make recession more likely they borrow less spend less and invest less some of those behaviors have startedsome companies in some industries have announced layoffs for example citing diminished business activities or expectationsbut they have not become a broad trend yet market volatility as a result of the prospects for recession coupled with the uncertainties associated with the war in eastern europe financial markets worldwide were volatile in financial asset values broadly fell last year especially during the second and third quarters in the us several major stock indices fell more than from their most recent high levels which conventionally means those indices entered a bear market impacts on fhn in several respects fhn has benefited significantly from rising rates fhn is likely to continue to benefit as long as the rise in lending rates outpaces the rise in deposit and other funding rates however some of fhns businesses have been negatively impacted the general increase in interest rates this year has pushed home mortgage rates in the us higher fhns direct mortgage lending and lending to mortgage companies saw business decline significantly in if mortgage rates continue to rise fhns revenues and earnings from those areas likely will continue to fall substantially compared with moreover fhns revenues from bond trading and related activities fell significantly in due to rising rates coupled with elevated market volatility more generally a recession with stillrising rates likely would have a significant negative impact on fhns businesses overall even if loan spreads continue to widen demand for loans is likely to fall reserves for loan losses are likely to rise many commercial activities that generate fee income are likely to decline and competition for clients is likely to sharpen fhn already has experienced some of these impacts the deeper or longer a recession lasts the more significant these negative impacts are likely to be for fhn complicating the economic situation in the us is the impact that federal reserve policy has had on the value of the us dollar versus many other major currencies the dollar rose substantially during much of resulting in pressure on us exports which are relatively more expensive a windfall for imports into the us which are relatively cheaper and pressure on nonus borrowers of us dollars and international buyers of goods traded mainly using us dollars the dollars strength started to abate late in and continuing into but resurgence continues to be a risk although fhn is not directly and significantly impacted by a strong us dollar some clients have been and will continue to be moreover other central banks have followed the lead of the federal reserve to support their respective currencies as in the us those tightening actions dampen economic activity and increase the risk of recession in those countries libor reference rate reform libor the london interbank offered rate libor for many years was the most widely used reference rate in the world a large but declining portion of fhns floating rate loans use libor denominated in us dollars usd as the reference rate to determine the interest rate paid by the clientborrower in addition certain floatingrate securities issued by fhn use usd libor as the reference rate libor is based on a mix of transactionbased data and expert judgment about market conditions it is published in different tenors which are time periods such as 1week 1month 12month etc libor discontinuance about a decade ago evidence emerged that some members of the panel that set libor may have manipulated the published libor rates rather than using strictly goodfaith judgments several banks were fined in the chief executive of the united kingdom financial conduct authority the fcathe governmental regulator of liborannounced that it intended to halt persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after in the fca announced that tenors of usd libor would no longer be published as follows one week and 2month usd libor would not be published after december and all other usd libor tenors eg overnight 1month 3month 6month and 12month tenors would not be published after june us regulatory position in the federal reserve the occ and the fdic jointly encouraged us banks to transition away from libor for new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by december they noted that entering into new contracts that use libor as a reference rate after december would create safety and soundness risks us federal legislation in march congress passed the adjustable interest rate libor act the legislation addresses loans that will remain on libor as of the june cessation date and that either have no fallback provisions or that contain fallback provisions that do not identify a specific benchmark replacement per the legislation at the final cessation of usd libor banks may cause such loans to fall back to a sofrbased benchmark rate with such rate to be selected by the federal reserve board the libor act also provides safe harbor from liability for banks that select the boardselected replacement benchmark rate at the cessation of libor in december the federal reserve board issued regulation zz its final rule to implement the adjustable interest rate libor act alternatives to libor libor became the marketpreferred reference rate because it was perceived by lenders and borrowers as being superior to alternatives in a wide range of circumstances now that the origination of liborindexed loans has ended no single alternative reference rate has replaced libor for usd transactions instead a number of different reference rates are being used in different circumstances these include daily sofr the alternative reference rates committee arrc is a group of privatemarket and financial regulator participants convened by the federal reserve board and the new york federal reserve bank to help ensure a successful transition from usd libor to a more robust reference rate the arrc has recommended the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its preferred alternative sofr resets daily and is based on actual transaction data for the us treasury repurchase market accordingly sofr represents a nearly riskfree secured overnight rate cme term sofr published by cme group term sofr is a forwardlooking rate with 1month 3month 6month and 12month tenors and is based on sofr futures contracts the arrc recommended conventions for term sofr rates recommended cme group as the administrator for term sofr and recommended cme groups term sofr rates furthermore the federal reserve boards regulation zz issued in december identifies cme term sofr plus a spread adjustment as defined in the libor act as the boardselected replacement rate for the purposes of loans that are repriced in accordance with the libor act upon the june final cessation of libor ameribor the american interbank offered rate ameribor index is produced by the american financial exchange ameribor is based on actual transaction data involving credit decisions by many financial institutions on an unsecured basis bsby the bloomberg shortterm bank yield index bsby is a proprietary rate index calculated and published by bloomberg index services limited bsby is based on actual transaction data involving unsecured credit prime although traditional prime rates with each bank setting its own are not likely to regain the prominence they had decades ago when us banks were much smaller and the industry was more fragmented for some clients and products banks may increase their usage of prime rates the alternatives listed above were made available to the majority of fhns commercial clients starting in november in accordance with the us regulatory position fhn ceased entering into new libor based contracts as of december each alternative reference rate has advantages and disadvantages compared with other alternatives in various circumstances despite being supported by the arrc and being the principal index used in interest rate derivatives in the postlibor environment daily sofr has not gained significant traction among middle market commercial borrowers when assessing daily sofr some borrowers have observed that the adoption of a rate with a daily reset introduces operational complexities including changes to the loans interest calculation and billing cycle by contrast cme term sofr is a rate that like libor has rate reset tenors of monthly or longer and like daily sofr carries the endorsement of the arrc for these reasons cme term sofr has gained traction among many middle market commercial borrowers all of the alternative reference rates selected by fhn to date meet the international organization of securities commissions iosco principles for financial benchmarks as affirmed by the rate administrator andor an independent auditor while banking regulators have stated that banks are free to choose the index rates they offer clients some public sector officials have urged caution in using the new credit sensitive alternative reference rates a category that includes bsby and ameribor primarily due to the robustness of underlying data used to derive the rates more specifically there is concern of an inverted pyramid effect where a large number of financial contracts could be priced using an index derived from a relatively low volume of transactions in an interagency statement on october us banking regulatory agencies noted that supervised institutions should understand how their chosen reference rate is constructed and be aware of any fragilities associated with that rate and the markets that underlie it iosco has also warned of the potential for the inverted pyramid problem and will monitor how the iosco label is used by administrators fhn is monitoring the credit sensitive reference rates and regulatory guidance around use of such rates additionally fhn expects that each financial contract will contain fallback language to guide transition from a credit sensitive rate to an alternative should that action be deemed necessary in the future thus far the use of credit sensitive alternative reference rates by fhn and its clients has been limited fhns actions to date transition plans starting in fhn modernized the fallback language used in its loan documentation to better handle how floating rate loans would be reset if libor ceased to be published during the loan term in the fourth quarter of fhn ceased using usd libor for new lending and renegotiated terms with clients whose loans are based on 1week or 2month usd libor which ceased publication at the end of only a small portion of fhns clients had such loans on the consumer side fhn began transitioning from liborbased adjustable rate mortgages arms to sofrbased arms in november and no longer offers liborbased arms sofr has emerged as a market standard for arms in the us and is the conforming convention for fannie mae and freddie mac for all products fhn developed a gotomarket strategy which included pricing considerations associate training and client communications all required systems processes and reporting were updated to accommodate the transition fhn ceased origination of new contracts tied to libor on december in addition fhn has established a libor transition office to assist associates in working with their clients to renegotiate terms of loan and derivative contracts that extend past the june cessation date for the remaining usd libor tenors noted above since november fhn bankers have been amending the pricing of existing liborbased commercial loans via a rate change at the time of loan renewal or via amendments to the loan documents to change the benchmark rate additionally fhn bankers and fhnf derivatives marketers are amending interest rate derivative contracts whose tenors extend beyond the june final cessation date of libor while fhn has exposure to libor in various contracts eg securities derivatives fhns primary exposure to libor is in floating rate loans to customers and derivative contracts issued to customers through fhn financial below is a summary of these exposures as of december financial accounting aspects in the fasb issued asu facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting which provides several optional expedients and exceptions to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform the scope of asu was expanded in with asu scope refer to the accounting changes with extended transition periods section of note significant accounting policies for additional information in december the fasb issued asu deferral of the sunset date of topic which extends the transition window for asu from december to december consistent with key usd libor tenors continuing to be published through june us tax accommodation on december the irs released final guidance that is intended to facilitate the transition of existing contracts from libor to new reference rates without triggering modification accounting or taxable exchange treatment for those contracts this guidance specifies what must be met in order to qualify for the beneficial transition approach and fhn is considering this guidance in its transition plans critical accounting policies estimates allowance for loan and lease losses managements policy is to maintain the alll at a level sufficient to absorb expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio management performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its loan and lease portfolio to identify trends and to assess the overall collectability of the portfolio management believes the accounting estimate related to the alll is a critical accounting estimate as changes in it can materially affect the provision for loan and lease losses and net income it requires management to predict borrowers likelihood or capacity to repay including evaluation of inherently uncertain future economic conditions prepayment activity must be projected to estimate the life of loans that often are shorter than contractual terms it requires estimation of a reasonable and supportable forecast period for credit losses for loan portfolio segments before reversion to historical loss levels over the remaining life of a loan and expected future recoveries of amounts previously charged off must be estimated accordingly this is a highly subjective process and requires significant judgment since it is difficult to evaluate current and future economic conditions in relation to an overall credit cycle and estimate the timing and extent of loss events that are expected to occur prior to the end of a loans and leases estimated life fhn believes that the principal assumptions underlying the accounting estimates made by management include the commercial loan portfolio has been properly risk graded based on information about borrowers in specific industries and specific issues with respect to single borrowers borrower specific information made available to fhn is current and accurate the loan portfolio has been segmented properly and individual loans have similar credit risk characteristics and will behave similarly the lives for loan portfolio pools have been estimated properly including consideration of expected prepayments the economic forecasts utilized and associated weighting selected by management in the modeling of expected credit losses are reflective of future economic conditions entityspecific historical loss information has been properly assessed for all loan portfolio segments as the initial basis for estimating expected credit losses the reasonable and supportable periods for loan portfolio segments have been properly determined the reversion methodologies and timeframes for migration from the reasonable and supportable period to the use of historical loss rates are reasonable expected recoveries of prior charge off amounts have been properly estimated and qualitative adjustments to modeled loss results reasonably reflect expected future credit losses as of the date of the financial statements while management uses the best information available to establish the alll future adjustments to the alll and methodology may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the estimates such adjustments to prior estimates as necessary are made in the period in which these factors and other relevant considerations indicate that loss levels vary from previous estimates selection and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts are the most significant inputs in quantitative alll calculations due to the sensitivity of the alll determination to macroeconomic forecasts changes in those forecasts can result in materially different results between reporting periods in the determination of the alll as of december fhn utilized moodys baseline s1 more favorable and s2 adverse scenarios for the calculation of the alll fhn placed the most weight on moodys baseline scenario but also included weightings for s1 and s2 scenarios primarily to reflect the uncertainty of macroeconomic forecasts associated with high inflation and the federal reserves response with higher interest rates international and domestic supplychain issues and labor challenges all of these factors contribute to an increased likelihood of recession in due to the dynamic relationship of macroeconomic inputs in modeling calculations quantifying the effects of changing individual inputs is highly challenging additionally management applies judgment in developing qualitative adjustments that are considered necessary to appropriately reflect elements of credit risk that are not captured in the quantitative model results to provide some hypothetical sensitivity analysis fhn prepared two alternate quantitative calculations applying weighting to moodys baseline and s2 adverse scenarios these hypothetical calculations resulted in a reduction and increase respectively in alll in comparison to the alll recorded at december inclusive of qualitative adjustments that are affected by the weighting of forecast scenarios see note significant accounting policies and note allowance for credit losses for detail regarding fhns processes models and methodology for determining the alll income taxes fhn is subject to the income tax laws of the us and the states and jurisdictions in which it operates fhn accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc income taxes significant judgments and estimates are required in the determination of the consolidated income tax expense fhn income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid income tax expense consists of both current and deferred taxes current income tax expense is an estimate of taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and includes income tax expense related to uncertain tax positions a dta or a dtl is recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities deferred taxes can be affected by changes in tax rates applicable to future years either as a result of statutory changes or business changes that may change the jurisdictions in which taxes are paid additionally dtas are subject to a more likely than not test to determine whether the full amount of the dtas should be realized in the financial statements fhn evaluates the likelihood of realization of the dta based on both positive and negative evidence available at the time including as appropriate scheduled reversals of dtls projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial performance realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the carryforwards attributable to or generated with respect to the dta in projecting future taxable income fhn incorporates assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying business if the more likely than not test is not met a valuation allowance must be established against the dta the income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which fhn operate are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities in determining if a tax position should be recognized and in establishing a provision for income tax expense fhn must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws interpretations may be subjected to review during examination by taxing authorities and disputes may arise over the respective tax positions fhn attempts to resolve disputes that may arise during the tax examination and audit process however certain disputes may ultimately be resolved through the federal and state court systems fhn monitors relevant tax authorities and revises estimates of accrued income taxes on a quarterly basis changes in estimates may occur due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities revisions of estimates may also result from income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies revisions in estimates may be material to operating results for any given period see note income taxes for additional information including discussion of valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets and the potential impact of unrecognized tax benefits on future earnings contingent liabilities a liability is contingent if the amount or outcome is not presently known but may become known in the future as a result of the occurrence of some uncertain future event fhn estimates its contingent liabilities based on managements estimates about the probability of outcomes and their ability to estimate the range of exposure accounting standards require that a liability be recorded if management determines that it is probable that a loss has occurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated in addition it must be probable that the loss will be confirmed by some future event as part of the estimation process management is required to make assumptions about matters that are by their nature highly uncertain and difficult to estimate the assessment of contingent liabilities including legal contingencies involves the use of critical estimates assumptions and judgments managements estimates are based on their belief that future events will validate the current assumptions regarding the ultimate outcome of these exposures however there can be no assurance that future events such as court decisions or decisions of arbitrators will not differ from managements assessments whenever practicable management consults with thirdparty experts eg attorneys accountants claims administrators etc to assist with the gathering and evaluation of information related to contingent liabilities based on internally andor externally prepared evaluations management makes a determination whether the potential exposure requires accrual in the financial statements see note contingencies and other disclosures for additional information regarding fhns existing material contingent liabilities including those with and without loss accruals and discussion of reasonably possible loss amounts for
