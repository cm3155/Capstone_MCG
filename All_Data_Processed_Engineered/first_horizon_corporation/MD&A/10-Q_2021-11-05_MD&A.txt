securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities generally deposits and borrowed funds the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on average interestearning assets and the effective cost of interestbearing liabilities these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the frb and market

a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss in value from adverse market movements over an assumed fixed holding period within a stated confidence level fhn employs a model to compute daily var measures for its trading securities inventory fhn computes var using historical simulation with a 1year lookback period at a confidence level with 1day and 10day time horizons additionally fhn computes a stressed var measure the svar computation uses the same model but with model inputs reflecting historical data from a continuous 12month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate for the trading securities portfolio a summary of fhns var and svar measures for 1day and 10day time horizons is as follows table 21var and svar measures three

trading securities inventory is static because fhn financial procures fixed income securities for purposes of distribution to clients its trading securities inventory turns over regularly additionally fhnf traders actively manage the trading securities inventory continuously throughout each trading day accordingly fhnfs trading securities inventory is highly dynamic rather than static as a result it would be rare for fhnf to incur a negative revenue day in its fixed income activities at the levels indicated by its var measures in addition to being used in fhns daily market risk management process the var and svar measures are also used by fhn in computing its regulatory market risk capital requirements in accordance with the market risk capital rules for additional information regarding fhns capital adequacy refer to the capital section of this mda fhn also performs stress tests on its trading securities portfolio to calculate the potential loss under various assumed market scenarios key assumed stresses used in those tests are down bps assumes an instantaneous downward move in interest rates of basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve up bps assumes an instantaneous upward move in interest rates of basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve curve flattening assumes an instantaneous flattening of the interest rate yield curve through an increase in shortterm rates and a decrease in longterm rates the 2year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to increase basis points and the 10year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease basis points shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlations to the 2year and 10year points curve steepening assumes an instantaneous steepening of the interest rate yield curve through a decrease in shortterm rates and an increase in longterm rates the 2year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease basis points and the 10year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to increase basis points shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlations to the 2year and 10year points credit spread widening assumes an instantaneous increase in credit spreads the difference between yields on treasury securities and nontreasury securities of basis points model validation trading risk management personnel within fhn financial have primary responsibility for model risk management with respect to the model used by fhn to compute its var measures and perform stress testing on the trading inventory among other procedures these personnel monitor model results and perform periodic backtesting as part of an ongoing process of validating the accuracy of the model these model risk management activities are subject to annual review by fhns model validation group an independent assurance group charged first horizon corporation 3q21 form 10q report with oversight responsibility for fhns model risk management interest rate risk management net interest income simulation analysis the information provided in this section including the discussion regarding the outcomes of simulation analysis and rate shock analysis is forwardlooking actual results if the assumed scenarios were to occur could differ because of interest rate movements the ability of management to execute its business plans and other factors including those presented in the forwardlooking statements section of this report management uses a simulation model to measure interest rate risk and to formulate strategies to improve balance sheet positioning earnings or both within fhns interest rate risk liquidity and capital guidelines interest rate exposure is measured by forecasting months of nii under various interest rate scenarios and comparing the percentage change in nii for each scenario to a base case scenario where interest rates remain unchanged assumptions are made regarding future balance sheet composition interest rate movements and loan and deposit pricing in addition assumptions are made about the magnitude of asset prepayments and earlier than anticipated deposit withdrawals the results of these scenarios help fhn develop strategies for managing exposure to interest rate risk while management believes the assumptions used and scenarios selected in its simulations are reasonable simulation modeling provides only an estimate not a precise calculation of exposure to any given change in interest rates based on a static balance sheet as of september nii expo sures over the next months assuming rate shocks of plus basis points basis points basis points and basis points are estimated to have favorable variances as shown in the table below table interest rate sensitivity shifts in interest rates in bps change in projected net interest income a steepening yield curve scenario where longterm rates increase by basis points and shortterm rates are static results in a favorable nii variance of a flattening yield curve scenario where longterm rates decrease by basis points and shortterm rates are static results in an unfavorable nii variance of rate shocks of minus basis points and basis points result in unfavorable nii variances of and assuming the absence of negative rates these hypothetical scenarios are used to create a risk measurement framework and do not necessarily represent managements current view of future interest rates or market developments fhns net interest income has been and likely will continue to be impacted by the disruption from the covid19 pandemic and the low rate environment the impact of government assistance programs and other developments have influenced net interest income results although those impacts have started to abate impacts are expected to continue for some time fhn continues to monitor current economic trends and potential exposures closely liquidity risk management among other things alco is responsible for liquidity management the funding of assets with liabilities of appropriate duration while mitigating the risk of unexpected cash needs alco and the board of directors have adopted a liquidity policy of which the objective is to ensure that fhn meets its cash and collateral obligations promptly in a costeffective manner and with the highest degree of reliability the maintenance of adequate levels of asset and liability liquidity should provide fhn with the ability to meet both expected and unexpected cash and collateral needs key liquidity ratios asset liquidity levels and the amount available from funding sources are reported to alco on a regular basis fhns liquidity policy establishes liquidity limits that are deemed appropriate for fhns risk profile in accordance with the liquidity policy alco manages fhns exposure to liquidity risk through a dynamic real time forecasting methodology base liquidity forecasts are reviewed by alco and are updated as financial

support through loan commitments lines of credit and standby letters of credit many of the commitments are expected to expire unused or be only partially used therefore the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements based on its available liquidity and available borrowing capacity fhn anticipates it will continue to have sufficient funds to meet its current commitments market uncertainties and prospective trends fhns future results could be affected both positively and negatively by several known trends key among those are changes in the us and global economy and outlook government actions affecting interest rates government actions intended to stimulate the economy and government actions and proposals which could have negative impacts on the economy at large or on certain businesses additional risks relate to how the covid19 pandemic continues to affect fhns clients political uncertainty changes in federal policies including those publicly discussed formally proposed or recently implemented and the potential impacts of those changes on our businesses and clients and whether fhns strategic initiatives will succeed federal reserve easing policy in march the federal reserve eased by lowering shortterm interest rates and starting an asset purchase program intended to lower longerterm interest rates and foster access to credit the effective yields of 10year and 30year us treasury securities achieved record low rates these changes in interest rates and the volatility in the market negatively impacted fhns net interest margin amortization of net processing fees related to government relief programs associated with the covid19 pandemic including the paycheck protection program offset a portion of the net interest margin decline during easing policy has continued for most of the year interest rates have fluctuated but remained very low continuing to adversely impact fhns net interest margin the federal reserve recently announced that it will begin to reverse its easing policy by reducing tapering its asset purchases the federal reserves public comments suggest without any guarantee that tapering will conclude at some point mid2022 after which no further asset purchases will be made fhn cannot predict whether short term interest rates will be raised during this taper period or at any other point in time long term interest rates have risen recently though they remain very low by historical standards public first horizon corporation 3q21 form 10q report expectations related to tapering coupled with public federal reserve comments and concerns about inflation in the us likely have been significant contributors to that change covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic caused extraordinary disruption that negatively impacted the economy and business activity especially lending other than lending related to home mortgages the impact of the pandemic on fhns performance is discussed further in results of operations during the latter part of the second quarter and into the third quarter of fhn saw the lending pipeline start to improve in several areas unrelated to home mortgages as covid19 restrictions were at least partially eased in many of fhns markets fhn expects the impact of covid19 restrictions to continue to diminish over the rest of this year with further progress in vaccination rates however the risk of resurgence remains fhn continues to closely monitor the impact of the pandemic and its effects on fhns clients and communities and on the financial markets throughout the pandemic fhn has worked with clients to discuss challenges and solutions provide line draws and new extensions to existing clients provide support for small businesses including lending through the ppp and provide lending and deposit assistance through deferrals and waived fees libor reference rate reform libor the london interbank offered rate libor is the most widely used reference rate in the world and has been for many years a substantial majority of fhns floating rate loans use libor denominated in us dollars usd as the reference rate to determine the interest rate paid by the clientborrower in addition certain floatingrate securities issued by fhn use usd libor as the reference rate libor is based on a mix of transactionbased data and expert judgment about market conditions before it was based mainly on expert judgment it is published in different tenors which are time periods such as 1week 1month 12month etc libor discontinuance about a decade ago evidence emerged that some members of the panel that set libor may have manipulated the published libor rates rather than using strictly goodfaith judgments several banks were fined in the chief executive of the united kingdom financial conduct authority the fcathe governmental regulator of liborannounced that it intends to halt persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after in the fca announced that tenors of usd libor will no longer be published as follows one week and 2month usd libor will not be published after december and all other usd libor tenors eg overnight 1month 3month 6month and 12month tenors will not be published after june us regulatory position in the federal reserve the occ and the fdic jointly encouraged us banks to transition away from libor for new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by december they noted that entering into new contracts that use libor as a reference rate after december would create safety and soundness risks alternatives to libor libor became the marketpreferred reference rate because it was perceived by lenders and borrowers as being superior to alternatives in a wide range of circumstances fhn believes that no single alternative reference rate will immediately replace libor for usd transactions instead fhn believes it is likely that different alternatives will be used in different circumstances although it is difficult to predict which alternatives will be favored by market participants in any particular situation at this time it seems likely that the following alternative reference rates may be used by market participants once usd li bor is discontinued sofr the alternative reference rates committee arrc is a group of privatemarket and financial regulator participants convened by the federal reserve and the new york federal reserve bank to help ensure a successful transition from usd libor to a more robust reference rate the arrc has recommended the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its preferred alternative sofr is based on actual transaction data for the us treasury repurchase market accordingly sofr represents a riskless secured overnight rate term sofr published by cme group term sofr is a forwardlooking rate with 1month 3month and 6month tenors and is based on first horizon corporation 3q21 form 10q report sofr futures contracts the arrc has recommended conventions for term sofr rates and has recommended cme group as the administrator for term sofr ameribor the american interbank offered rate ameribor index is produced by the american financial exchange ameribor is based on actual transaction data involving credit decisions by many financial institutions on an unsecured basis bsby the bloomberg shortterm bank yield index bsby is a proprietary rate index calculated and published by bloomberg index services limited bsby is based on actual transaction data involving unsecured credit prime although traditional prime rates with each bank setting its own are not likely to regain the prominence they had decades ago when us banks were much smaller and the industry was more fragmented for some clients and products banks may increase their usage of prime rates other alternative reference rates are being developed and considered the alternatives listed above are those fhn currently expects to make available to the majority of commercial clients in november each alternative reference rate has advantages and disadvantages compared with other alternatives in various circumstances despite being supported by the federal reserves arrc sofr appears unlikely to gain the level of market acceptance and usage that usd libor enjoyed within the us key aspects of sofr that support this view are a sofr fundamentally is an overnight rate and so is not easily or reliably translated into typical libor tenors and b sofr is both secured and riskless and so does not necessarily track a banks cost of funds very well for a bank it is critical to avoid significant mismatches over time between its variable cost of funds and its variable interest income term sofr attempts to address some of these shortcomings but not all of them al l of the alternative reference rates selected by fhn to date meet the international org anization of securities commissions iosco principles for financial benchmarks as affirmed by the rate administrator andor an independent auditor while banking regulators have stated that banks are free to choose the index rates they offer clients some public s ector officials have urged caution in using the new credit sensitive alternative reference rates primarily due to the robustness of underlying data used to derive the rates more specifically there is concern of an inverted pyramid effect where a large number of financial contracts could be priced using an index derived from a relatively low volume of transactions in an interagency statement on
