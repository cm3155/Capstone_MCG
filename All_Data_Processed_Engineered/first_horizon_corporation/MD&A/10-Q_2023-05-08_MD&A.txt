difference between the interest earned on interestearning assets generally loans leases and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities generally deposits and borrowed funds the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the effective yield on average interestearning assets and the effective cost of interestbearing liabilities these factors are influenced by the pricing and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by external factors such as local economic conditions competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the frb and market interest rates the following tables present the major components of net interest income and net

deteriorated to such an extent that the credits are individually reviewed for expected credit losses classified as substandard or worse placed on nonaccrual status foreclosed or in process of foreclosure or in active or contemplated litigation lrrd has the authority and responsibility to enter into workout andor rehabilitation agreements with troubled commercial borrowers in order to mitigate andor minimize the amount of credit losses recognized from these problem assets while every circumstance is different lrrd will generally use forbearance agreements generally months as an element of commercial loan workouts which might include reduced interest rates reduced payments release of guarantor term extensions or entering into short sale agreements principal forgiveness may be granted in specific workout circumstances the individual expected credit loss assessments completed on commercial loans are used in evaluating the appropriateness of qualitative adjustments to quantitatively modeled loss expectations for loans that are not considered collateral dependent if a loan is collateral dependent the carrying amount of a loan is written down to the net realizable value of the collateral each assessment considers any modified terms and is comprehensive to ensure appropriate assessment of expected credit losses consumer loan modifications fhn does not currently participate in any of the loan modification programs sponsored by the us government but does generally structure modified consumer loans using the parameters of the former home affordable modification program within the heloc and real estate installment loans classes of the consumer portfolio segment troubled loans are typically modified by reducing the interest rate in increments of basis points to a minimum of for up to years and a possible maturity date extension to reach an affordable housing debttoincome ratio after years the interest rate generally returns to the original interest rate

card hardship program or a longerterm credit card workout program in the credit card hardship program borrowers may be granted rate and payment reductions for months to year in the credit card workout

as described under risk management included in item of fhns annual report on form 10k market risk management valueatrisk and stress testing var is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss in value from adverse market movements over an assumed fixed holding period within a stated confidence level fhn employs a model to compute daily var measures for its trading securities inventory fhn computes var using historical simulation with a 1year lookback period at a confidence level with 1day and 10day time horizons additionally fhn computes a stressed var measure the svar computation uses the same model but with model inputs reflecting historical data from a continuous 12month period that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate for our trading securities portfolio a summary of fhns var and svar measures for 1day and 10day time horizons is presented in the following table table i217 var svar measures three months ended march as of march  in

measures of these component risks are as follows table i218 schedule of risks included in var as of march as of march as of december  in millions 1day 10day 1day 10day 1day 10day interest rate risk credit spread risk the potential risk of loss reflected by fhns var measures assumes the trading securities inventory is static because fhn financial procures fixed income securities for purposes of distribution to clients its trading securities inventory turns over regularly additionally fhnf traders actively manage the trading securities inventory continuously throughout each trading day accordingly fhnfs trading securities inventory is highly dynamic rather than static as a result it would be rare for fhnf to incur a negative revenue day in its fixed income activities at the levels indicated by its var measures in addition to being used in fhns daily market risk management process the var and svar measures are also used by fhn in computing its regulatory market risk capital requirements in accordance with the market risk capital rules for additional information regarding fhns capital adequacy refer to the capital section of this mda fhn also performs stress tests on its trading securities portfolio to calculate the potential loss under various assumed market scenarios key assumed stresses used in those tests are down bps assumes an instantaneous downward move in interest rates of basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve up bps assumes an instantaneous upward move in interest rates of basis points at all points on the interest rate yield curve curve flattening assumes an instantaneous flattening of the interest rate yield curve through an increase in shortterm rates and a decrease in longterm rates the 2year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to increase basis points and the 10year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease basis points shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2year and 10year points curve steepening assumes an instantaneous steepening of the interest rate yield curve through a decrease in shortterm rates and an increase in longterm rates the 2year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to decrease basis points and the 10year point on the treasury yield curve is assumed to increase basis points shifts in other points on the yield curve are predicted based on their correlation to the 2year and 10year points credit spread widening assumes an instantaneous increase in credit spreads the difference between yields on treasury securities and nontreasury securities of basis points model validation trading risk management personnel within fhn financial have primary responsibility for model risk management with respect to the model used by fhn to compute its var measures and perform stress testing on the trading inventory among other procedures these personnel monitor model results and perform periodic backtesting as part of an ongoing process of validating the accuracy of the model these model risk management activities are subject to annual review by fhns model validation group an independent assurance group charged with oversight responsibility for fhns model risk management interest rate risk management net interest income simulation analysis the information provided in this section including the discussion regarding the outcomes of simulation analysis and rate shock analysis is forwardlooking actual results if the assumed scenarios were to occur could differ because of interest rate movements the ability of management to execute its business plans and other factors including those presented in the forwardlooking statements section of this report management uses a simulation model to measure interest rate risk and to formulate strategies to improve balance sheet positioning earnings or both within fhns interest rate risk liquidity and capital guidelines interest rate exposure is measured by forecasting months of nii under various interest rate scenarios and comparing the percentage change in nii for each scenario to a base case scenario where interest rates remain unchanged assumptions are made regarding future balance sheet composition interest rate movements and loan and 1q23 form 10q report part i item managements discussion analysis mda deposit pricing in addition assumptions are made about the magnitude of asset prepayments and earlier than anticipated deposit withdrawals the results of these scenarios help fhn develop strategies for managing exposure to interest rate risk while management believes the assumptions used and scenarios selected in its simulations are reasonable simulation modeling provides only an estimate not a precise calculation of exposure to any given change in interest rates based on a static balance sheet as of march nii expo sures over the next months assuming rate shocks of plusminus basis points plusminus basis points plusminus basis points and plus basis points are estimated to have variances as shown in the table below table i219 interest rate sensitivity shifts in interest rates in bps change in projected net

where longterm rates decrease by basis points and shortterm rates are static results in an unfavorable nii variance of these hypothetical scenarios are used to create a risk measurement framework and do not necessarily represent managements current view of future interest rates or market developments shortterm interest rates have reached their highest levels in years which coupled with market disruption from recent high profile bank failures has increased competitive pressures on deposit costs the yield curve was inverted for much of the last half of which has continued into early the inverted yield curve indicates market expectations that shortterm rates are likely to peak and then decline in future periods market participants are divided in their opinions regarding the timing and magnitude of further shortterm rate increases or subsequent rate cuts fhn continues to monitor current economic trends and potential exposures closely liquidity risk management among other things alco is responsible for liquidity management the funding of assets with liabilities of appropriate duration while mitigating the risk of unexpected cash needs alco and the board of directors have adopted a liquidity policy of which the objective is to ensure that fhn meets its cash and collateral obligations promptly in a costeffective manner and with the highest degree of reliability the maintenance of adequate levels of asset and liability liquidity should provide fhn with the ability to meet both expected and unexpected cash and collateral needs key liquidity ratios asset liquidity levels and the amount available from funding sources are reported to alco on a regular basis fhns liquidity policy establishes liquidity limits that are deemed appropriate for fhns risk profile in accordance with the liquidity policy alco manages fhns exposure to liquidity risk through a dynamic real time forecasting methodology base liquidity forecasts are reviewed by alco and are updated as financial conditions dictate in addition to the baseline liquidity reports robust stress testing of assumptions and funds availability are periodically reviewed fhn maintains a contingency funding plan that may be executed should unexpected difficulties arise in accessing funding that affects fhn the industry or both subject to market conditions and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements from

several factors which are considered by the board these factors include fhns current and prospective capital liquidity and other needs applicable regulatory restrictions including capital conservation buffer requirements and availability of funds to fhn through a dividend from first horizon bank additionally banking regulators generally require insured banks and bank holding companies to pay cash dividends only out of current operating earnings consequently the decision of whether fhn will pay future dividends and the amount of dividends will be affected by current operating results fhn paid a

prospective trends fhns future results could be affected both positively and negatively by several known trends key among those are changes in the us and global economy and outlook government actions affecting interest rates and government actions and proposals which could have positive or negative impacts on the economy at large or on certain businesses industries or sectors additional risks relate to how the covid19 pandemic continues to affect fhns clients political uncertainty changes in federal policies including those publicly discussed formally proposed or recently implemented and the potential impacts of those changes on our businesses and clients and whether fhns strategic initiatives will succeed inflation recession and federal reserve policy economic overview the year and first quarter were economically unusual in several respects the period was marked by strong inflation which began in the federal reserve implementing a tightening policy to contain inflation by rapidly increasing shortterm interest rates and ending asset purchases and low unemployment rates despite low economic growth key aspects were although the us economy flirted with recession in it did not officially enter one in recession risk remains high but no recession has begun although recessionary expectations were and remain high consumption and employment have been robust the rise in shortterm interest rates by the federal reserve was both rapid and substantial taking the overnight fed funds rate from in march to a year later despite the extremely rapid and vigorous tightening of monetary policy inflation in the us remains high in relation to the decade preceding the covid19 pandemic and in relation to the federal reserves stated longterm goal of key events and circumstances are noted in the following discussions federal reserve and rates the federal reserve raised shortterm rates several times in and three times in the raises in were and basis points eachaggressive by historical standardswhile the raises were a moretypical basis points each the federal reserve has expressed its intent to bring inflation under control even at the risk of 1q23 form 10q report part i item managements discussion analysis mda creating or deepening an economic recession however recently the federal reserve also has indicated a willingness to slow or even pause its increases to better assess economic reaction thus far the march banking crisis mentioned below may contribute to a more cautious approach as it fuels concerns that falling deposits could result in reduced ability to lend fhn cannot predict exactly when or how much shortterm rates will be further raised nor how marketdriven longterm rates will behave nor how those actions may affect financial markets during fhns expectations align with the forward curve in that shortterm rates will stop rising at some point in and begin to fall by the fourth quarter of yield curve during the past five quarters the yield curve flattened and inverted many times unusual yield curve effects including inversion may continue a traditional measure of inversion occurs when the twoyear us treasury rate is higher than the tenyear rate traditional inversion was sustained for much of the last three quarters which is very unusual sustained traditional yield curve inversion is viewed with statistical support as a harbinger of economic recession recession the us economy contracted experienced negative growth during the first two quarters of in both cases modestly although two consecutive quarters of contraction often coincides with recession in it did not the economy expanded in each of the most recent three quarters however the rate of expansion is falling if that trend continues the economy will contract again later this year or early next recession expectations in the us were high in and first quarter traditionally when people and businesses expect a recession they often change their behaviors in ways that make recession more likely they borrow less spend less and invest less some of those behaviors have started but they have not become a broad trend yet banking crisis in march two large regional us banks failed after sudden large deposit outflows and a major swiss bank was acquired by another bank at the behest of regulators the two us failures appear to have been caused in significant part by risky funds management practices exacerbated by a highly unusual deposit mix and 2022s sharp rise in rates in the aftermath of these two failures bank investors and clients across the us have become more focused on deposit mix funding risk management and other safetysoundness concerns the market values of virtually all us bank stocks fell quickly and strongly in march with a few falling about the media published stories about actual and possible bank runs by depositors most us banks saw net outflows of deposits in and early as the impacts of covid19 crisis programs faded and rates available from nonbankaccount investments improved according to federal reserve data starting in midmarch the two failures triggered an abrupt net deposit outflow from all but the largest us banks specifically during the week of march the largest us banks as a group saw net deposit inflows exceeding billion while all other smaller us banks as a group saw net outflows of nearly billion the next week large and small us banks experienced net outflows of roughly and billion respectively the march crisis shock was shortlived however during the final week of march both large and small us banks collectively experienced net inflows of deposits roughly mirroring the first week of march before the crisis emerged the two us bank failures resulted in congressional calls for higher regulation of midsized regional banks especially for those with billion or more of assets fhn cannot predict what if any legislative or regulatory outcomes will result from the crisis in late april a third large regional us bank failed after experiencing very large deposit outflows in march although this failure was widely anticipated volatility in regional bank stocks resumed in may the three failed us banks had a few characteristics that fhn believes were significant negative factors contributing to loss of confidence by depositors in addition to having an unusual customer mix wellabovemedian levels of deposits not covered by fdic insurance significant portions of the pandemic deposit inflows invested in longerterm fixedrate debt securities and very high in relation to regulatory capital market value losses on those investments when rates rose in and early these factors made them unusually susceptible to a cascade of negative effects when deposit levels diminished for the entire industry starting in as customers sought better returns in the rising rate environment war in europe the russian military invaded ukraine in february over a year later that conflict continues much of europe and the rest of the world including the us imposed economic sanctions on russia the war and sanctions resulted in global oil and gas prices rising precipitously in early oil prices have been volatile since then but have oscillated around much higher price levels than before the war market volatility valuations as a result of the prospects for recession coupled with the uncertainties associated with the war in eastern europe financial markets worldwide were volatile during much of 1q23 form 10q report part i item managements discussion analysis mda volatility overall moderated somewhat in late and early but volatile episodes have continued financial asset values broadly fell last year especially during the second and third quarters broad stock indices have improved from 2022s low points but remain well below threeyear highs particularly for midsize and smaller companies impacts on fhn in fhn benefited significantly from rising rates as the rise in lending rates outpaced the rise in deposit and other funding rates in the first quarter of that outpacing ended with fhns net interest margin compressing slightly from fourth quarter fhn experienced a normalization of deposit levels since first quarter as it allowed higher cost surge deposits resulting from economic stimulus programs to move off balance sheet net deposit outflows averaged to billion in each of the last three quarters of and fell again by roughly billion in first quarter despite these outflows average deposit balances were higher in first quarter than first quarter to mitigate net deposit outflows fhn has increased deposit rates appreciably over the past several quarters particularly in first quarter in contrast during this period fhns total loans grew modestly each quarter these impacts resulted from a deliberate plan to allow deposits to return to more normal levels in relation to loans we started raising deposit rates to more competitive levels during first quarter and expect to continue to meet competitive pressures going forward if net deposit outflows continue despite higher deposit rates at some point fhn will have to increase borrowing at higher cost than deposits or take other funding actions that could adversely impact earnings although fhn cannot predict future actions of its depositors fhn believes it has avoided key characteristics of the three failed us banks specifically fhn has a traditional customer mix for a bank its size of fhns deposits at march were fdic insured and another were collateralized and because fhn kept a substantial portion of the pandemic deposit inflows in overnight and other cash investments the market value losses embedded in fhns investments do not diminish fhns regulatory capital levels appreciably in relation to regulatory requirements as mentioned above in the federal reserve has slowed the rate of increase of interest rates and fhn expects rate increases to pause later this year increased stability in interest rates eventually may bring increased stability in funding including deposits in addition some of fhns businesses have been negatively impacted by rising rates rate increases have pushed home mortgage rates in the us much higher than in early fhns direct mortgage lending and lending to mortgage companies saw business decline significantly in moreover fhns revenues from bond trading and related activities fell significantly in due to rising rates coupled with elevated market volatility these impacts have continued in although bond trading results improved modestly in first quarter a recession if one occurs likely would have a significant negative impact on fhns businesses overall demand for loans likely would fall loan losses and provision expense likely would rise many commercial activities that generate fee income likely would decline and competition for clients likely would sharpen fhn already has experienced some of these impacts the deeper or longer a recession lasts the more significant these negative impacts are likely to be for fhn libor reference rate reform libor the london interbank offered rate libor for many years was the most widely used reference rate in the world a small and declining portion of fhns floating rate loans use libor denominated in us dollars usd as the reference rate to determine the interest rate paid by the clientborrower in addition certain floatingrate securities issued by fhn use usd libor as the reference rate libor is based on a mix of transactionbased data and expert judgment about market conditions it is published in different tenors which are time periods such as 1week 1month 12month etc libor discontinuance about a decade ago evidence emerged that some members of the panel that set libor may have manipulated the published libor rates rather than using strictly goodfaith judgments several banks were fined in the chief executive of the united kingdom financial conduct authority the fcathe governmental regulator of liborannounced that it intended to halt persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after in the fca announced that tenors of usd libor would no longer be published as follows one week and 2month usd libor would not be published after december and 1q23 form 10q report part i item managements discussion analysis mda all other usd libor tenors eg overnight 1month 3month 6month and 12month tenors would not be published after june us regulatory position in the federal reserve the occ and the fdic jointly encouraged us banks to transition away from libor for new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by december they noted that entering into new contracts that use libor as a reference rate after december would create safety and soundness risks us federal legislation in march congress passed the adjustable interest rate libor act the legislation addresses loans that will remain on libor as of the june cessation date and that either have no fallback provisions or that contain fallback provisions that do not identify a specific benchmark replacement per the legislation at the final cessation of usd libor banks may cause such loans to fall back to a sofrbased benchmark rate with such rate to be selected by the federal reserve board the libor act also provides safe harbor from liability for banks that select the boardselected replacement benchmark rate at the cessation of libor in december the federal reserve board issued regulation zz its final rule to implement the adjustable interest rate libor act alternatives to libor libor became the marketpreferred reference rate because it was perceived by lenders and borrowers as being superior to alternatives in a wide range of circumstances now that the origination of liborindexed loans has ended no single alternative reference rate has replaced libor for usd transactions instead a number of different reference rates are being used in different circumstances these include daily sofr the alternative reference rates committee arrc is a group of privatemarket and financial regulator participants convened by the federal reserve board and the new york federal reserve bank to help ensure a successful transition from usd libor to a more robust reference rate the arrc has recommended the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its preferred alternative sofr resets daily and is based on actual transaction data for the us treasury repurchase market accordingly sofr represents a nearly riskfree secured overnight rate cme term sofr published by cme group term sofr is a forwardlooking rate with 1month 3month 6month and 12month tenors and is based on sofr futures contracts the arrc recommended conventions for term sofr rates recommended cme group as the administrator for term sofr and recommended cme groups term sofr rates furthermore the federal reserve boards regulation zz issued in december identifies cme term sofr plus a spread adjustment as defined in the libor act as the boardselected replacement rate for the purposes of loans that are repriced in accordance with the libor act upon the june final cessation of libor ameribor the american interbank offered rate ameribor index is produced by the american financial exchange ameribor is based on actual transaction data involving credit decisions by many financial institutions on an unsecured basis bsby the bloomberg shortterm bank yield index bsby is a proprietary rate index calculated and published by bloomberg index services limited bsby is based on actual transaction data involving unsecured credit prime although traditional prime rates with each bank setting its own are not likely to regain the prominence they had decades ago when us banks were much smaller and the industry was more fragmented for some clients and products banks may increase their usage of prime rates the alternatives listed above were made available to the majority of fhns commercial clients starting in november in accordance with the us regulatory position fhn ceased entering into new libor based contracts as of december each alternative reference rate has advantages and disadvantages compared with other alternatives in various circumstances despite being supported by the arrc and being the principal index used in interest rate derivatives in the postlibor environment daily sofr has not gained significant traction among middle market commercial borrowers when assessing daily sofr some borrowers have observed that the adoption of a rate with a daily reset introduces operational complexities including changes to the loans interest calculation and billing cycle by contrast cme term sofr is a rate that like libor has rate reset tenors of monthly or longer and like daily sofr carries the endorsement of the arrc for these reasons cme term sofr has gained traction among many middle market commercial borrowers all of the alternative reference rates selected by fhn to date meet the international organization of
