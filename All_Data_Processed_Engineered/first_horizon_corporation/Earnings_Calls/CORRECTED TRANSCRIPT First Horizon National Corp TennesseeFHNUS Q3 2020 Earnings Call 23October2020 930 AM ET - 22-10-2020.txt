morning everybody thank you for joining us this morning this has been a very significant quarter for us we closed our merger of equals with iberiabank we acquired the branches from suntrust truist really excited about that that integration was done in midjuly weve made significant progress during the quarter we are very pleased with the performance of the organization the great work that our associates did to serve their customers and their communities in what has been a challenging and trying time we see good momentum in our business we proved out again the countercyclical benefit of our businesses mortgage mortgage warehouse lending and our fixed income business our balance sheet continues to perform well as weve talked about over the last or years we have really significantly restructured the balance sheet and to focus it more on ci we had net chargeoffs of basis points during the quarter and we saw a slight tick up in nonperforming assets but we ended the period with about billion of capacity for losstaking so very strong balance sheet we had a good quarter in terms of deposit activity we had good customer inflows and the balance sheet feels good and we saw some progress made in adjusting our pricing to compensate for the lower interest rate environment first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 also during the quarter we made good progress on our expenses we captured another million of run rate in our quest for millionplus in expense savings we feel very good about our progress in controlling costs and our planning for the integration theres a couple of good slides in the investor deck which you can reference that lay out the expectations around expense efficiencies over the next couple of quarters and year our capital base continues to be strong very very pleased with the positioning we came in with a cet1 ratio of our tangible book value dilution was very slight from the acquisition of the branches and the completion of the merger largely offset by earnings during the quarter our planning around the integration continues to go well we expect that the significant integration work will be completed by the fall early fall of were on target and on track for completing that integration we have a lot of work to do between now and then and we have associates all over the organization who are working to make sure that we do it in a seamless fashion and minimize absolutely minimize adverse impact on our customers and our communities finally before i turn it over to bj i feel very strongly that were wellpositioned for this somewhat uncertain environment clearly the progress of the ppp programs the fiscal stimulus has been positive todate on the economy but theres still uncertainty i feel like were wellpositioned in terms of a strong balance sheet strong losstaking capacity strong capital and also positioned with a tailwind in the sense we have our non our countercyclical businesses and we also have the ability to realize a significant amount of cost savings over the next to months so with that i will stop ill turn it over to bj and then wed be happy to take questions later bj william c losch iii senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee all right thanks bryan good morning everybody if we could turn to slide our gaap eps totaled and on an adjusted basis which excludes the pretax net notable items detailed here totaling million or which are largely tied to the iberia merger we think its important to note that the impact of merger accounting on our financials are overall in line with the estimates we provided to you during the second quarter call and then the pro formas released during the quarter weve provided the detail on the marks and other impacts related to the merger in the appendix for your review on slide we provide a summary of our adjusted financials for the quarter compared with fhn standalone adjusted results in the prior quarters so obviously the trends here largely reflect the net impact of the iberia merger and the branch acquisition moving on to slide for a look at net interest income and net interest margin we generated net interest income of million in the quarter up million linked quarter driven by the impact of the merger nii remains fairly stable with second quarter combined levels despite the impact of the challenging rate environment third quarter results included a million benefit from accretion or about basis points on the nim which was modestly higher than we originally expected given higher prepayments reported nim came in at million in the quarter down basis points reflecting the impact of low rates and continued elevated levels of liquidity somewhat offset by accretion we also continue to take action to improve our deposit pricing profile our deposit rate paid was down again this quarter with interestbearing deposit cost down to basis points our goal is to manage down interestbearing deposit cost towards the levels we saw in the first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 prior zero interest rate cycle back in of around basis points this quarter we plan to align our deposit pricing across the expanded franchise which should provide additional benefit as we enter our nim also continues to reflect the impact of much higher levels of liquidity we estimate excess cash lowered the third quarter margin approximately basis points we averaged about billion of excess cash which grew to billion at quarter end as you know while this excess cash position lowers the margin it does not impact our net interest income we continue to look opportunistically for more attractive reinvestment alternatives going forward and expect to put more of that money to work over time in the fourth quarter we expect to see additional margin pressure likely in the high singledigit to low doubledigit range but expect that level to represent the bottom for nim going forward moving on to slide and i would note that here we have provided our results versus prior period combined results for fhn and iberia we delivered solid performance in fee income again in the third quarter with relatively stable results on a linked quarter basis and a yearoveryear increase as the benefit of our countercyclical businesses and fixed income and mortgage banking helped to mitigate covidrelated pressure in some of our more traditional banking fee income streams fixed income results came in as expected with relatively stable results linked quarter and million increase yearoveryear given average daily revenues of million mortgage banking again delivered standout results with a million increase linked quarter and almost million yearoveryear secondary originations of billion were up from strong second quarter levels while gain on sale margins expanded over basis points to as we look into the fourth quarter while we expect a seasonal slowdown in volumes for both of these businesses we do expect overall market conditions to remain favorable for both for the foreseeable future as you can see on slide we continue on our commitment to expense discipline linked quarter expenses were down million as the reduction in personnel expense and other noninterest expense was partially offset by an expected increase in intangibles amortization from the merger and branch acquisition salaries and benefits increased million driven by the alignment of benefits across the combined platform the addition of personnel from the acquired branches and an increase in healthcare costs following the pandemic driven slowdown this increase was more than offset by a reduction in revenuebased incentives and commissions as well as lower deferred comp costs our results this quarter also reflects the benefit of million in net merger cost saves giving us a yeartodate total of million we understand the importance of remaining incredibly focused on utilizing cost control as a lever in this environment we have unique advantages to be able to do so given our merger and well continue to look for further expense reductions beyond our targeted merger savings turning to slide and sic and you see a review of our loan growth and funding profiles relative to combined first horizon iberia results as expected period end loan growth was modest as customer demand remains muted payoffs continue and utilization rates have returned to more normal levels bright spot in the quarter was continued strong mortgage warehouse demand which drove loans to mortgage companies up billion on a spot basis and approximately million on average similar to fixed income and mortgage banking originations the loans to mortgage companies function as a countercyclical high return specialty business for us and we expect continued strong performance first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 on the liability side period end deposits were up billion driven by the branch acquisition primarily as well as continued strong customer inflows which enabled us to run off higher costs noncustomer balances given current levels of excess liquidity and our enhanced market presence we expect to continue to move our interest bearing deposit costs lower particularly as we move to align our pricing strategies across the footprint we also further improved our funding profile with billion reduction in borrowings from combined levels as we leveraged our excess liquidity to pay down legacy iberia federal home loan bank advances starting on slide well cover asset quality over the next few slides clearly our results this quarter reflect the impact of the merger with a lot of moving parts but if we step back broadly speaking overall asset quality continues to remain fairly benign so far outside of energy despite the impacts of covid19 net chargeoffs came in at basis points up from basis points for legacy fhn driven by energyrelated losses and we saw a relatively modest basis point increase in npl to basis points of total loans despite the impact of the merger on slide you see we continue to add reserves this quarter as the impact of the merger and branch acquisition added million to the allowance for credit losses outside of merger math we also built reserves by a modest million therefore we ended the quarter with reserves of billion which is equivalent to of the loan portfolio excluding the low risk ppp and loans to mortgage companies portfolios and about four times annualized net chargeoffs when you also factor in the unrecognized discount on acquired loans we have total loss absorbing capacity of billion or over of total loans on slide we provide an update of our view around the portfolios that investors have been most focused on in terms of impacts from the pandemic we continue to do very detailed portfolio reviews of industries currently affected and in the quarter we reviewed in detail billion of loans in the commercial portfolio across these various sectors as a result of that as well as other broader portfolio reviews we believe that just under of our total loans should be and are subject to a heightened level of monitoring weve shown the subsectors of the portfolio that may be more stressed such as real estate lending energy retail trade and the nonfast food portion of our accommodationfood service portfolio its important to note that other sectors such as essential services recreational goods manufacturing and home improvement are continuing to perform well and additionally our higher quality consumer portfolio is performing well as well with a weighted average fico score of on a refresh basis as weve mentioned todate customers are proving to be more resilient than originally feared and overall stress appears to be declining we provided data in the appendix on the reserve coverage across our portfolio as well as on deferrals which have now declined meaningfully to around of total loan balances from a peak of almost overall we continue to feel very comfortable with our risk profile and reserve levels particularly after going through the very detailed process of marking the iberia loan book which represents about of the portfolio moving on to capital and tangible book value per share on slide as we mentioned tbv per share of remained relatively stable in the second quarter as strong earnings were offset by the impact of the iberia merger and the truist branch acquisition and the cet1 ratio ended the quarter at near term we expect to continue targeting at cet1 ratio in the to range turning to slide for a merger integration update we continue to be very energized as bryan said by the opportunities ahead of us in connection with our merger of equals in the year since we announced the deal weve established a strong merger integration framework to help ensure that we capitalize on the opportunities in a highly efficient manner even in the face of the pandemic first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 weve already done a great deal to align our cultures processes and systems to ensure a successful integration weve completed much of hrrelated integration by identifying leadership and converting payroll systems and on the customer side we built out our gotomarket and organizational models as well as finalizing our customer experience dashboard were on track to convert various other platforms and are currently planning for the full systems conversion to occur in the fall of again as bryan said in the third quarter we delivered million of cost savings bringing the yeartodate total to million and in the table on the right weve provided a modestly updated view of our expected saves over time we continue to be highly confident in our ability to deliver at least million of annualized savings in but the path of the saves has shifted by a quarter or so this largely reflects the fact that we now believe its prudent to target a septemberoctober system conversion versus the previous view of a late second quarter conversion in the table on the right as well we provided the estimated timing of our merger savings on an annualized basis in third quarter our annualized expense base excluding incentives and commissions totaled about billion and based on our expectations for the timing of the merger saves we believe that our expenses excluding incentives and commissions should reflect the low single digit decrease wrapping up on slide we believe were wellpositioned to capitalize on the benefits of our more diversified business model over time and through our iberia merger and the branch acquisition we now have an expanded franchise across some of the most attractive markets in the south as weve demonstrated this quarter we have a revenue mix that helps us offset nii pressure from the low rate environment we also have the advantage of merger cost saves and through prior acquisitions and efficiency initiatives weve proven our commitment to expense controls our prudent approach to risk management should help us mitigate credit losses going forward and we have the benefit of the marked loan book and significant loss absorption capacity while the economic environment remains challenging and loan demand is muted it gives us the ability to focus on merger integration for the next year and we believe our business model will result in outperformance and shareholder value creation in the quarters and years ahead since i know theyre listening i want to give a quick shout out to all those on our various teams across ir accounting finance credit and technology in particular that have done extraordinary work and spent long hours getting us to this point this is my 47th quarterly earnings call with first horizon and ive seen a lot over the years but the complexity and uniqueness of this quarter and the year take the cake thanks to all of you for your efforts so with that ill turn it back over to bryan d bryan jordan president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee thank you bj we believe our strong balance sheet capital and liquidity will serve us well in this difficult operating environment weve maintained strong underwriting standards and built a diversified portfolio focused on profitability and performance in a downturn despite the economic headwinds we are uniquely positioned to capture merger opportunities with enhanced scale better efficiency and improved earnings power to create significant shareholder value first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 we are incredibly committed to continuing to assist our associates communities and customers in efforts to overcome the impact of covid19 and revitalize the economy thank you to all of our associates for their outstanding commitment in helping us and helping our company and our communities navigate this unprecedented landscape again were very wellpositioned im very very excited about the combination of iberiabank and first horizon and we think we have unprecedented opportunities ahead of us with that operator wed be happy to take any questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning everybody d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee hi jared susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee good morning jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey maybe just starting on credit i guess first whats the credit mark specifically on the energy portfolio beyond just the provision susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yes if you weve got about a seven point almost coverage allowance coverage for the energy portfolio thats detailed on page in the earnings deck jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess in addition to the allowance whats the ph 141hour mark on the acquired portfolio william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee the mark on the energy portfolio im not sure i have that in front of me in detail but like susan said we had energy chargeoffs in the quarter we replenished the reserve on a combined basis and the reserve on the energy portfolio remains at about so still very healthy reserves first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah for sure okay great thanks and then it looks like you used the august economic baseline in calculating the provisioning allowance this quarter given that september and october have improved could we view this as a high watermark for the allowance ratio assuming all else equal william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah its a great question i would hope so but were hoping for the best but still pretty cautious about what could occur particularly around the election and entering the fall and what could happen with covid19 etcetera so obviously we feel very comfortable with our reserve levels we feel very comfortable with the marks that weve made we continue to take a cautious approach to particularly releasing reserves youll see we had just a very modest build on our reserves despite the fact that like you said that the outlook has certainly gotten better from second quarter and even from the august scenarios that we used so were going to continue to be cautious about holding on to reserves for a while but at some point clearly youre going to see that if the economy continues to improve which we sure hope it does d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee hey jared this is bryan if you would ask us months ago and say how would you feel going into the second months and maybe the next months of pandemic how would you feel about things i dont think we would have said things would look as good as they do right now and so were pleased with the progress i pointed out earlier the significant impact of the fiscal programs that congress has put in place bj mentioned some of the uncertainty that still exists in the environment and we still believe i believe very strongly personally that in certain sectors of our economy consumers and some of the more severely impacted industries associated with social distancing and the fallout of the pandemic need some targeted fiscal support so i believe strongly that the next several weeks they may be weeks months of how congress deals with additional fiscal support is going to set the direction for the next several quarters im optimistic today i think theyre making progress but as bj said with the uncertainty we think it was appropriate to maintain strong reserves going into the fourth quarter in the turn of jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats great color thanks and then i guess maybe just a bigger picture question do you feel like youre able to maybe more immediately go on the offense and take advantage of some of the market disruption in your markets from the larger competitors or larger deals that have happened or are you still more focused on integration first and that more of an offensive stance would be end of the year im sorry end of next year d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee well depending on how you define offense jared i would say i think we are very flatfooted in terms of taking an opportunity in the market to pick up new relationships and while i didnt mention it earlier were seeing the beginnings of very nice revenue synergy between the two organizations iberiabank and first horizon it is very its an environment that is somewhat unique in that youve got to be cautious as you look at what you put on the balance sheet and how you use the balance sheet but were looking for opportunities to take first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 advantage of this dislocation and weve seen benefits from the ppp program and we think therell be additional opportunities down the road if it relates to further ma thats not really in our frame of reference today were focused on the merger and the integration that we have in front of us i said earlier ill repeat its a tremendous amount of work between now and early september of next year as bj said our teams are working really really hard and doing a great job and im excited about what our associates are going to get accomplished but thats most important and then well figure out whats next after that susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee one thing i would add to the question about opportunities for the offence we are seeing what i would call some generational opportunities with prospects that our bankers have been calling on in various markets where in some cases years that are really great opportunities to bring those into the fold to become clients so these are businesses that have survived through many cycles that we know well and opportunities to bring those over but we are being selective as you can imagine at this time but we do remain open for business for the right profiles the right industry and the right client selection which has been important really to both legacy banks for many many years operator our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning guys susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee good morning william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee good morning d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc bj i guess if you can just start with net interest income i think you gave the and the margin one in terms of your margin guidance were i guess down basis points plus or minus is that on a do you expect that decline in the core margin and then when we look at the million in core nii do you expect that number to go higher or lower in fourth quarter and beyond first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah so lets see lets start when i said high single digit low double digit that was more on the reported nim side i think we can be a little bit better on the core nim due to opportunities around further deposit rate paid reductions some of the opportunities that were seeing in higher yield portfolios like loans to mortgage companies putting excess cash to work and those types of things so i feel pretty good about that clearly as you know in merger accounting we had a higher level of accretion this quarter which we expect to be modestly lower in the fourth which is driving a lot of the decline in the reported nim but as ive said we expect the nim to bottom out in the fourth quarter and then into next year be relatively stable to hopefully modestly improving as we do some of the things that i just mentioned ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and the core nii of million do you think that goes higher from here or lower william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah so like i said if the margin is if the core margin i think is relatively stable maybe down a little bit into the fourth but bottoming out then its going to be a question of how do we put the excess cash to work improve the deposit rate paid and see what kind of loan growth that we can have in terms of opportunities into so i guess to your question i see it kind of bottoming out and then being able to hopefully improve into if the economy gets better ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it so we should expect some decline in fourth quarter in line with your sort of core nii core nim decline but from then on it should stabilize as we look into the first half of next year is that reasonable william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah yeah so id say the core nii we think could be flattish going into the fourth quarter and then hopefully improving with opportunities going into next year ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and sorry to ask so many questions on that i think theres just a big divergence in terms of expectations around nii next year so its helpful in terms of the color you provided and just in terms of expenses so thanks for the update on what the cost savings tied to the integration both first horizon and iberia had a pretty strong track record in terms of expense management we are seeing banks kind of take another look at real estate costs other expenses coming out of the lockdowns just talk to us in terms of whats the opportunity like in terms of expense savings meaningfully exceeding the million that you laid out william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 yeah so i think youve heard you heard bryan used the term millionplus i used the term at least million so clearly we are very confident in our ability to get to million and thats not even an issue for us we are looking beyond that to find further cost reduction which were highly confident that we can capture we want to make sure that we get all the million in the numbers but we are working on things like customer behavior changes and the impacts on branches and how customers want to do business with us we have million square feet of office space and branch space that we certainly think that we can optimize further over time given changes due to the pandemic and we are working very hard as we put our systems and processes together to find opportunities to use the systems upgrades and new systems that were putting in place to find further process improvements and do a lot of work around rpas and so on which anthony and randy and their teams have had great expertise at so we are confident that the million is going to happen its a question of how much higher and so well come out further in the fourth quarter and into talking about further plans that we have to continue to get cost saves but this is a journey not a destination particularly given this environment were highly confident well be able to deliver as we have before d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee ebrahim this is bryan to add to bjs comments i think hes exactly right you have to keep in mind that we have a lot of moving parts right now with the integration and we want to be thoughtful about how we put the two organizations together and not do things that damage the customer franchise while we integrate so were being thoughtful about expenses that said bj is absolutely right we think we can do and well do more than million and we dont think we should try to pin the tail on that number today but we will sometime in the not too distant future it is clear to us that the effect of the covid19 experience and the pandemic has changed customer behaviors probably for the long term it has changed our work habits it has changed a lot of things then we believe very firmly that we need to factor all of that into how we put these two organizations together how we look at expenses what our branch or banking center coverage look like and bj went through a lot of the important details that were looking at so its a work in progress were committing to doing more than million well be back to you with how much down the road ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee yeah operator our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee hi steve susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee good morning d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee hi steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so first just a followup bj in your comments for the core nim to hold stable in the fourth quarter it seems that excess cash is going to build right so youre going to have even more weight on the nim in so its a thought that at least in the short run you realign deposit costs i dont know if its a event that you get to the mid and thats the nearterm support and then from there you deploy excess cash and thats what provides further support to nim because it was apparent core nim would go down in the fourth quarter based on just the cash phenomenon william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah so steve good question our current expectation is that we are able to put more of the excess cash to work in the fourth quarter so we did see an increase into the end of the period from some of the averages but the strategies that were contemplating now including letting contracts expire on market index deposits some of the things were thinking about to soak up the excess cash around either loan portfolio or securities portfolio and other things we think that we can move the excess cash position down the other is we still think that theres opportunity in loans to mortgage companies as well which is a very efficient use of our excess cash and so usually seasonally that business can be down but given the very strong environment that were seeing today in the mortgage space we think that it could hold up in terms of balances in the fourth quarter steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats actually very helpful and then on the reserve i hear the comments right youre still cautious given we are still in the middle of a pandemic but when we look at the reserve right its billion its exppp and thats on top of the credit mark and if you have strong loan growth and mortgage warehouse you dont really need reserves for those so if the rest of loan demand is somewhat muted why would you need to provide any additional provision over the next few quarters william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee i hope youre right i think as i said in the beginning were taking a pretty cautious stance at this point right its a lot easier to be conservative at this point and hold reserves and then release them as opposed to be too quick first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 to let reserves go and then see a reversal of the improvement in the economy and have to build reserves again so im highly confident again in where our reserves are and our loss absorption capacity and i do think that eventually we will release reserves but we think its a little too early to make that call at this point steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks and then finally you guys are pointing out that the threeyear plan is finalized or getting finalized in the fourth quarter bryan should we expect anything material from that in terms of revenue or additional expense initiatives what should we get out of that thanks d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee well yes i dont think that in the short run you should expect any significant shift in our business this is really bringing together the combined organization the team has done and anthony restel has done a good job leading it but the team has done a great job pulling the strategy together and what i think that you will see out of it is where were going to focus in markets and products set and its about how we have combined focus as an organization then and as we said a couple of different ways clearly expense control will be an element of that but what were really trying to focus on is beyond the integration what is it that we need to be executing on to be on the ground running through the integration and then most particularly to really pick up momentum when we get that completed in september of next year so its got to a strong focus on markets and where we invest and where we put people and product how we work on our crosssell opportunities the revenue synergies that exist by bringing the combined products together and we believe given what weve seen on a macro basis in the us that the states that we do business in the markets that we do business in are going to be very positively impacted by the migration of people and businesses and opportunity and we just want to be positioned to make sure that we take full advantage of that steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thanks for all the color d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee sure thing thank you operator our next question comes from brock vandervliet with ubs please go ahead brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thank you just piling on to steves question on the reserve bj i mean what do you need to see to tap that reserve because i think the point here is that relative to peers youre very well set up is this something that a moodys outlook would reveal where youd have the confidence or is it hey you just doubled the size of the bank and give us a couple quarters but we get it its coming down and any further color there first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah so the way these models are built as you know is that the quantitative part of the models are driven largely by historical loss history as well as what the forward view is as informed by the moodys scenarios we then create qualitative overlays particularly in stressed portfolios in sectors where we have a little bit more concern or uncertainty around it and as you might imagine that if the outlook continues to get better which we certainly hope it does the quantitative models are going to tell us to release reserves and at some point were going to be comfortable that the qualitatives that we have arent needed so again i think were well reserved i do think reserves will come down into next year its a question of timing and we just think at this point given continued uncertainty that its better to hold it as opposed to release it but we are confident that we are well reserved and well be able to do so brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay thank you and regarding the i believe its deferrals what do you see is the end game there are most of these are going to return to normal pi payments and a chunk restructured with very little real breakage or something different how does that how do you think that plays susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee hey brock based on even what weve seen of when it was at a higher level a couple of quarters ago many are returning just returning to making their payments some of them were cautious in the beginning and just said if i can take a deferral i will there will be some clearly that we will work with to restructure but at this point were seeing very very few clients ask for that what i would call a third round of deferral which i think is very good which is why the active deferrals have come down so dramatically but we are as you saw on one of the pages where we talked about our perceived updates on areas of perceived risk i think that was page in addition to ph overlaid that portfolios as a whole we continued we did it in the second quarter third quarter well do it in this quarter and as long as we need to with any sort of uncertainty around covid were also doing the indiscernible with individual clients so weve got really good insight and one of the things that i continue to feel very good about is the fact that our prudent underwriting in the beginning the client selection and seeing our business owners guarantors sponsors working with us during this time weve seen a lot of i think positives around that so youll see your question was what are you going to see i think youll see some of all of that youll see some thatll just return to normal youll see some that will have to work with us on a longer term basis and so we stand ready clientbyclient to make that happen brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay great thanks for the color first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 operator our next question comes from john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee good morning john william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee hey john d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi if i could just kind of beat the dead horse a little more here on the reserve if i could kind of go about it this way and can you just maybe give us a little bit of the granularity of your credit details behind what may have influenced your thoughts on the reserve particularly do you have your criticized and classified asset trends for the third quarter susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah we do hey john this is susan so overall our criticized went from to so thats on an obviously combined basis for second quarter to third quarter with both banks so you did see some increase of about million that moved into the criticized category in terms of the portfolios where we looked at doing a qualitative overlay theres a portfolio you would imagine that we would and if you look at the areas of perceived risk we have an additional overlay for energy additional overlays for hotels for retail and for some of the nonprofit and also the casual dining food service so those are areas where i think bryan and bj have said that on many of these questions we do were seeing some things loosen up were seeing some trends that we like but we just think its too early to be thinking about releasing reserves but based on what we know now we should be able to do that in a quarter or two if we continue to see good trends d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee hey john john pancari q analyst evercore isi right right first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee this is bryan to use your phrase there are a lot of ways to come at beating this dead horse and at the end of the day cecl implies a heck of a lot more precision than actually exists in reality and weve sort of look at this as a bit of an art and we apply these overlays mainly because it is too early and there is a degree of uncertainty about what will happen in terms of fiscal stimulus and how the pandemic plays out how far away are we from therapeutics how far away from a vaccination there is no intended signaling whatsoever that we see something about the portfolio that causes us to just keep them up other than we believe that we will lean into the art weve remained conservative its been our practice over many years and we will continue to evaluate it were as i said optimistic about how things are positioned today on october the 22nd or 23rd whatever the day is and we think this can play out very very well and when it does well release these reserves and theyll come back john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it thanks bryan d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee sure john pancari q analyst evercore isi and then separately on the expense side bj are you can you kind of just repeat the expense guidance for i think you had indicated did you say a low singledigit did you say decrease including incentives and commissions william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah john thanks so what i said was that our expense base excluding incentives and commissions which as you obviously know are going to rise and fall with revenue related fee income we expect that expense base ex incentives and commissions to be down lowsingle digits john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it got it and that is on a full year versus full year basis william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee yes yes and as we noted john pancari q analyst evercore isi indiscernible first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee im sorry go ahead john go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi no go ahead ill ask after you william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee i was just going to add quickly if you look in our press release and the supplement we did reorganize those the expense line items a little bit to make it easier for you all to explicitly see the incentives and commissions broken out from the rest of the expense base such that its easier for you to visibly see the expense discipline and the merger cost saves as they come through john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it ellen a taylor a headinvestor relations first horizon national corp tennessee and john its ellen hey john its ellen just one thing i want to clarify so if you we gave you our third quarter expense base excluding incentives and commissions thats the to because remember the first half of excluded ibkc so you got to utilize that third quarter annualized base john pancari q analyst evercore isi right right okay and does the base also exclude the charitable contribution and merger charges as well ellen a taylor a headinvestor relations first horizon national corp tennessee yes thats adjusted basis number that i just that we just referenced john pancari q analyst evercore isi yes all right thats it thank you william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee thanks john d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee thank you first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 operator our next question comes from ken zerbe with morgan stanley please go ahead kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee hi ken kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey so thanks for pointing out all the onetime items but aside from the four or three or four notable items that you guys called out were there any other line items in the income statement that were impacted by im just going to say volatility that might not recur in future quarters ellen a taylor a headinvestor relations first horizon national corp tennessee well i think we mentioned the trueup of the ibkc benefit so from a linked quarter perspective there was an initial stepup there that will persist but you shouldnt see a repeat of the stepup william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee thats right ken i cant think of anything that we would specifically call out for all of you i think broadly speaking what john just asked about our expense base from annualized versus it would all be captured in there we wouldnt call anything else out other than the notable items kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay perfect good ellen a taylor a headinvestor relations first horizon national corp tennessee i was going to say youll see over the course of coming quarters well see normal seasonal variability in certain line items but kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it of course no no understood yeah i guess i was just looking and so the next question is i was looking at the mortgage banking line which is obviously very strong this quarter certainly well above iberias run rate basis just for the mortgage banking like how do you see that playing out i mean obviously it sounds like fourth quarter is going to remain strong but where does that sort of normalize when we think about william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 yeah ken we still think that for the foreseeable future and i cant exactly put a fine point on foreseeable future but we think that the countercyclical businesses are going to remain strong i mean if you look at mortgage origination volumes and home price demand it is still very very strong and so were benefiting from that and so we expect that thats going to continue for both the mortgage origination side as well as the loans to mortgage companies side i would say that we had if you look in our information very strong gain on sale percentage this quarter we still think that volumes are going to be high gain on sale was probably higher than what it would normally be going forward we expect that to moderate a little bit but in aggregate we expect that the businesses will continue to drive outperformance and help us offset some of the nii headwinds that we see kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee sure operator our next question comes from brady gailey with kbw please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning guys william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee hey brady susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee hi d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee good morning brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i wanted to start with loan growth i know when we talked about it last quarter you said to expect kind of modest loan growth at best it seems like loan balances if you back out the acquisition noise were up a little bit organically in the third quarter from the mortgage warehouse but as you look forward how do you think about loan growth a lot of times when you do big acquisitions like this there is some loans that tend to run off so do you expect to see kind of some nearterm loan shrinkage in and then just how do you think about loan growth as we look into first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee yeah so ill start and bryan and susan can jump in but there are a few areas of growth that we think can certainly help us going into loans to mortgage companies of course we continue to think could be strong there are specialty businesses beyond loans to mortgage companies like assetbased lending like equipment finance that are very strong today and we expect those to continue going into next year we dont have any portfolios aside from what were doing to manage our exposure to energy of course but more broadly speaking we dont have any other portfolios that we are actively managing down or managing off so i dont expect any material stepdowns in terms of other areas of portfolio but traditional loan demand broadly across consumer and commercial portfolios is like weve said pretty muted at this point so we do have pockets of opportunity that can offset some declines so we dont have very high expectations for loan growth going into thats not because we dont want to look for new opportunities as susan said earlier we are and we will but its just the nature of the environment right now that weve got to pick our spots brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so not a ton of growth next year if you look at i heard you guys say that common equity tier the targeted range is to youre at now with decent profitability and not a lot of growth that ratio im guessing is going to move higher pretty rapidly so how do you think about buybacks seemed off the table this year but as we look into next year how do you think about share buybacks as your common equity tier moves over the top end of that targeted range d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee yeah brady this is bryan its clearly our desire to put capital to work in organic growth opportunities and so were always looking for that as the first way to leverage our balance sheet and well know a whole lot more about what loan growth looks like when we get past the turn of the year were very conscious of maintaining a strong capital base the dividend and the buyback are clearly vehicles for repatriating capital to shareholders that we cant put to use in the balance sheet so i dont want to get out in front of our board and the discussions there i feel very very good about where our dividend is i think its unlikely in the nearterm that we start the repurchase program but were constantly looking at how that capital ratio builds and how it fits into our expected usage in the balance sheet this problem that we all sit here with today and its universally true of financial services industry there are more known and unknowns than weve ever experienced and well all be smarter in days and so well have a more clear view of where we think that capital goes but to your basic point we think that capital will accumulate that we will see growth in not only our tier cet1 but well also see growth in our tangible book value brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks guys first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee sure operator our next question comes from christopher marinac with janney please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks susan when you talked about the criticized assets being at does that include the higher risk items that on slide susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yes thats the total criticized christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay so all of those susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee indiscernible is d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee but not everything in the higher risk category is a criticized asset susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee yeah its a subset of the christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thats what i want to know susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee the ones we highlighted for you on page are just ones that areas that were paying very very close attention to and are a big part of these portfolio reviews that were doing and im glad to say this there are things on this page that i think were even being conservative calling it a higher risk because of how weve underwritten and the things were hearing about from our clients first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 so we wanted to kind of give you the full list but i would say within some of these things ill give you an example our cre retail is very much a value oriented many are grocery anchored weve seen very little issues there with the most recent portfolio review we did we saw very few problems in that portfolio so i just wanted to tell you i think even this list of perceived risk isnt were on the conservative side but i believe thats how we want to be youve heard bryan and bj say that on other questions on this call we just want to be prudent and cautious during this time until we kind of get through things like the election potential vaccines etcetera and see how the economy if it continues to open up but we are pleased with what were seeing even in some of these areas of perceived risk christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc no thats helpful background thank you both for that i just i was just curious if the trend would be to see more migrate on to criticized or could it possibly go the other way or perhaps its too soon to tell susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon national corp tennessee yeah i think i mean again we are again touching these every quarter could you see a few of them go criticized you could but based on what we know now weve got them graded the way we believe they need to be graded the other thing is we are actually seeing some upgrades too so there are pockets of industries that are doing extremely well and there are players even within these higher risk industries that are better perform performing very very well we point out an example of that within the hotels and were in some of these markets weve been in these markets a long time that are doing really really well would be mountain areas beach areas where people can drive weve talked to clients who were having even within hotel portfolios their best year ever and its a combination of people wanting to just get away they can still work from there and these hotel operators are able to do it with a lower expense base same thing with quick serve restaurants many of them still are just drive through only and their expense base is down to dropping to the bottom line and is even better than so thats what i think is so important the fact that weve gone and done this portfolio review were talking to individual clients but again still being cautious and wanting to highlight for all of you the areas that we continue to look at quarteroverquarter during this covid situation christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thanks again i appreciate it d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee thank you william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon national corp tennessee thanks chris operator our next question comes from jennifer demba with truist securities please go ahead first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee good morning jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc is there any consideration to a bulk loan sale of any of these more atrisk loans particularly hotels thanks d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee jennifer this is bryan and were not we feel good about the quality of the portfolio we were very confident in what we know about it and it doesnt seem to make any sense to me or to us to sell it at a significant discount so somebody else can profit on the performance of that portfolio so it will well have a few problems here and there but overall we feel good about it we feel good about our reserve levels and we dont have any interest in selling any of it jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay thank you d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee sure jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc bryan this is a more longer term question what are your thoughts about remote working for your employee base going forward is the new normal going to be some combination of inoffice and remote working for almost everyone and how do you maintain corporate culture with more remote working thanks d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee yeah thats i think a fantastic topic and i think its we framed it very well we spent a lot of time talking about that very thing and bj mentioned the 5plusmillion square feet of space that we have we think people are going to work differently theres no doubt about that our customers are going to perform differently and it is going to be different i worry more about the downsides of managing corporate culture the conversations that dont happen because you dont get an elevator ride with somebody you thought at that next time i see him i need to say this or have this conversation i think its really a big downside in the sense that if you onboard new people when you bring in new bankers how do you bring them into the culture how do you mentor people how do you develop people so i think weve got to find sort of a balance and i think well end up as you suggested in a bit of a hybrid environment where first horizon national corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 23oct2020 people work more remotely for a portion of their time and we figure out how we spend the time we have together in a more quality fashion so that we dont just assume everybody can see everybody every day so i dont think anybody on our side believe weve got it figured out today but were paying a lot of attention to it and i think while we could go cut out a lot of office space and do things remotely because weve proven with technology that it works you really have a hard time as you said maintaining corporate culture in a two dimensional framework over webex or a zoom conference call so its something that were clearly paying attention to operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to bryan jordan ceo for any closing remarks d bryan jordan president chief executive officer director first horizon national corp tennessee thank you operator thank you everyone for joining us this morning as weve said a number
