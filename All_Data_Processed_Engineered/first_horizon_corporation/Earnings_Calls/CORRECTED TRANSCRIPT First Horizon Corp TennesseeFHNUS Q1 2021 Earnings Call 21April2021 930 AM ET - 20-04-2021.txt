ellen good morning everyone thank you for joining our call im really proud of the great progress weve made over the last nine months and integrating our mergerofequals is a great momentum for us to keep building in the business were off to a strong start in the first quarter of weve demonstrated solid performance in the quarter with good ppnr results reflecting the resiliency of our more diversified business model while loan demand continued to be muted as clients are still cautious were starting to see growth in the loan pipelines and expect demand to pick up some in the backhalf of the year our deposit growth remains strong with inflows from government stimulus and clients continuing to preserve cash during the quarter we generated impressive results on our fee income businesses and are gaining traction by capitalizing on additional revenue synergies tied to our mergerofequals im also proud of the work were doing to control the things that we can control particularly around expenses and deposit price despite the seasonal headwinds we reduced our latequarter adjusted expenses driven by our ongoing cost discipline we achieved annualized mergerrelated cost saves about million in the quarter the improving economic backdrop from january to march and our continued prudent risk management largely helped drive a million reserve release the power of our diversified and countercyclical model our strong risk profile ph along and the benefits from our moe helped us deliver a return on tangible common equity of excluding the impact of a million reserve release we generated a return on tangible common equity of over were making great progress for our key merger milestones we have completed early systems conversions including our mortgage and retail brokerage conversions with wealth and trust scheduled for the summer our core deposit systems conversion is still on track for the early fall of this year we have and will continue to make strategic investments in new technology that optimizes the client experience and improves productivity we continue to leverage fintech capabilities to enhance our product offerings drive efficiency and improve the customer experience our capital levels remain healthy with the common equity tier ratio of and we grew our tangible book value per share to at quarterend given the relatively limited loan demand we chose to opportunistically deploy capital through share repurchases and bought back about million shares in the first quarter so including dividends we returned a total of million of capital to our common shareholders im incredibly proud of our efforts to serve our clients communities and associates throughout the pandemic with ppp loans charitable contributions and by offering our associates increased flexibility and benefits our team is also intensely focused on capturing revenue synergies across markets and product lines leveraging our expanded suite of products services and expertise all instrumental in retaining and growing our client relationships we are increasingly optimistic about the economic recovery as weve seen improved rollout of the vaccine in our markets which is helping accelerate reopening we are also mindful of the fact that the past year had a number of unexpected turns and the path forward is unlikely to be a straight line with no surprises so while were prepared for a recovery in this year we also are prepared for the unexpected first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2021 we remain confident that the strength of our highly attractive franchise more diversified business model and benefits of the mergerofequal sic equals position us well to deliver top quartile returns over the mediumterm with that ill hand it over to bj for some comments william c losch iii senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee great thanks bryan good morning everybody lets start off on slide and just do a flyby on some of the key highlights in the quarter as bryan mentioned were really pleased with the profitability and the returns that were generating for shareholders we delivered gaap eps of or on an adjusted basis highlighted by strong fee income expense discipline and even further improvement in our credit quality and as weve said we position the company to succeed through various cycles and our diversified business model is working as we expected the fee businesses are performing very well to counter rate pressure were controlling what we can control with expense and deposit pricing merger integration is on track credit trends are excellent and our capital flexibility has allowed us to return capital to shareholders in a meaningful way given the overall muted landscape for loan growth we opportunistically repurchased million shares in the quarter at an average price of and including dividends as bryan talked about returned a total of million in capital to common shareholders looking at slide on adjusted financials we give you an overview for the quarter we generated ppnr of million up from revenues were down just slightly as impressive results from fixed income largely offset an expected reduction in nii while we saw a linkedquarter decline in expenses which reflects ongoing cost discipline the benefit of merger saves despite higher revenuebased incentives and seasonal headwinds in personnel given the very low net chargeoffs of only million were basis points on a billion loan portfolio combined with overall improvement in the macroeconomic outlook and a reduction in our loan balances we released million in reserves this quarter resulting in a provision credit of million and as bryan mentioned these strong results helped drive our return on tangible common equity above and even if you adjust for the reserve release our return on tangible common equity was over moving on to slide ill talk a little bit about net interest income we generated reported nii of million down million linkedquarter driven largely by a reduction in loan balances fewer days in the quarter and a further decline in the average libor bases as mentioned we are focused on controlling what we can control in this environment and we continue to drive down our funding costs which somewhat mitigated these headwinds we lowered our interestbearing deposit rate take another basis points this quarter to basis points overall and well continue to look for opportunities to lower our overall funding costs further while we remain in this low rate environment the reported first quarter nim was which decreased basis points linkedquarter driven by a 10basis point impact of continued increasing levels of excess cash which ended the quarter at billion moving on to slide and fee income the benefit of our more diversified platform was clearly on display again this quarter with a million linkedquarter increase driven by the great results in fixed income along with nice momentum in brokerage and wealth as well linkedquarter fixed income average daily revenue was up to million a day driven by favorable conditions as banks put increasing levels of excess cash to working bonds along with the past and continued volatility in rates in particular our mortgage and our governmentguaranteed debts were particularly active while mortgage banking and title decreased million linkedquarter our results first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2021 remains relatively strong compared to historical levels despite the seasonality higher interest rates and limited housing inventory moving on to expenses on slide youll see that adjusted expenses in the quarter were million down million linkedquarter highlighting our commitment to continue the expense discipline along with the benefit of an incremental million reduction tied to merger cost saves we held personnel costs overall relatively stable with levels with additional benefits from merger cost saves and ongoing tight expense control offsetting seasonal headwinds from fica tax resets and a million increase in revenuebased incentives and commissions in our ongoing efforts to control what we can control we are intensely focused on not only capturing merger efficiencies but continuing to streamline processes across the platform to position us well to continue to drive investments in the future turning to slides and we give you a look at our loan growth and our funding profile as expected we continue to see pressure on loan balances which were down billion in the quarter driven by decreases in mortgagerelated loans both in the consumer portfolio and in loans to mortgage companies business periodend loans were up slightly at largely due to a net billion increase in ppp loans as we look forward our lending pipelines are showing really nice momentum so we are optimistic that as the economy continues to improve we will see increased levels of customer activity in the backhalf of the year at periodend we saw a modest uptick in commercial utilization rates as well and were seeing nice early signs of revenue synergies across our platform particularly in the areas of assetbased lending and equipment finance on the liability side we saw continued inflow of deposits commercial deposit balance credit was driven by ppp and consumer deposit increase has reflected the new stimulus checks as i mentioned earlier we leveraged our excess liquidity position and decreased our interestbearing deposit cost by another basis points to basis points overall which helped drive a 4basis point decrease in our overall funding costs turning to asset quality starting on slide its really hard to believe how dramatically the landscape has changed in a year and we are incredibly pleased with the steps that we took to reposition our overall risk profile coming out of the great recession over a decade ago are now clearly being illustrated net chargeoffs to average loans improved basis points down basis points from last quarter while nonperforming loans remained relatively stable as i previously mentioned the combination of a significant improvement in the overall macroeconomic outlook and a reduction in loan balances drove a provision benefit of million and a reserve release at million and as you can see on slide the allowance to sic for credit losses coverage ratio declined only modestly from to basis points in and as a reminder we used the moodys february scenario and then incorporated other economic and portfolio factors to evaluate our overall reserve coverage we continue to feel very comfortable with our risk profile and our reserve levels briefly on capital on slide as bryan mentioned tangible book value per share was up reflecting strong earnings and in addition to a reduction in rwa helped drive a 28basis point improvement in our cet1 ratio to moving on to slide and our merger integration update we continue to drive strong progress on the integration front as we convert platforms and upgrade current systems and we remain on track for the full systems conversion in early fall of we have achieved million in annualized run rate savings against our net target of million were still on track for an annualized million by the end of the year as a reminder our gross savings are higher and is providing the flexibility to continue to make technology and other investments to drive continued improvement in processes and the overall customer experience first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2021 additionally were making solid traction on revenue synergies and thus far experienced roughly million of annualized revenue synergies that are tied to about million of commercial loan commitments we see significant additional opportunities with revenue synergies across markets and product lines as the economic activity continues to pick up on slide were really pleased with our performance just far through the first quarter of the year with all line items inline or better now than we provided on our first quarter earnings call in january we have therefore updated our expectations for both the second quarter and our fullyear outlook based on the strength we are seeing in our business and the economy for the second quarter in particular bryan and i we expect a lowsingle digit decrease with average loans down modestly given the outlook and while anticipate a continued relatively strong environment nearterm for our mortgage and fixed income business our outlook reflects a highsingle digit to lowdouble decrease from the first quarter on the expense front we expect noninterest expense to be relatively stable as we continue to focus on overall expense discipline and capture our merger efficiencies we expect chargeoffs to continue to be very low in the range of to basis points and that were likely to see continued reserve releases we expect to see our cet1 ratio to remain in the range for the second quarter and in terms of fullyear given our strong fee income performance in the first quarter and continued improvement in credit quality we have provided an update for the fullyear where we now expect only a mid to highsingle digit decrease in noninterest income lower net charge offs in the to 20basispoint range for the year and a cet sic cet1 target in the to range our business model is working wrapping up on slide were capitalizing on the opportunities of our more diversified business model and our highly attractive franchise we demonstrated solid revenue trends through the strength in our fee businesses despite interest rate headwinds were controlling what we can control as evidenced by the positive cost expense reductions were benefiting from merger cost saves and revenue synergies our credit quality is excellent and were delivering enhanced returns for shareholders before i hand it back over to bryan i just wanted to acknowledge aarti bowman who all of you certainly know this happens to be my 50th earnings call with first horizon and she has been there every step of the way with all of us and she will be moving on to pursue a passion of being

tennessee thank you bj i will add my thanks and appreciation for the great efforts of aarti over the last or years she certainly will be missed i am exceptionally proud of our continued execution and the results that were delivering we feel good about the strength of our balance sheet capital and liquidity positions as the economy starts to improve weve maintained underwriting standards and built a diversified portfolio focused on profitability and stability first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2021 we are positioned to capture merger opportunities with an enhanced scale better efficiency and improved earnings power and we will create significant shareholder value through it thank you to all of our associates for their hard work serving our customers communities and helping deliver for our shareholders with that jason well now take questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question is from brady gailey from kbw please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning guys d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee hey brady susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i wanted to first ask about loan growth i think if you look at periodend loans exppp and warehouse they were down about annualized which is not really a big surprise i think the industry has seen that as a whole this quarter but how do you think about what gets loan growth headed in the right direction it seems like most of your clients are flushed with cash when do you think youll really start to see some decent loan growth is it this year or do we have to wait for next year what are your thoughts on the timing there william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee hey brady its bj ill start so we talked in our opening comments about significantly increased activity and just to give you a little bit more color on that on the commercial side our pipelines which we have a high confidence of closing are up to from the beginning of the year so we are starting to see really really nice trends there utilization rates picked up slightly so that is were spending a little bit more activity as well and we started to see a little bit of turn in some of our markets particularly in places like north carolina or middle tennessee alabama on the specialty side assetbased lending equipment finance are starting to see pretty good upticks we expect loans to mortgage companies to strengthen in the spring and summer buying seasons so on the commercial side we are certainly seeing a lot more activity and im optimistic about what that means for our balance sheet in the backhalf of the year i would also say on the consumer side if you look at our consumer portfolios we have seen a fairly meaningful decline on those portfolios as people have refid and a lot of that has gone to secondary production we did make first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2021 some changes in our product set on the affluent side and then in certain areas around 10year arms year fixed where we believe that thats going to change the trajectory of our portfolio growth on the consumer side and as a matter of fact we have seen lots of pipelines increased significantly in the last days as made those changes so all of that to say is we see a lot of activity starting to come on and were optimistic about the back half of the year brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thats good to hear then my followup is just on the buyback if you look at your common equity tier its now you were active in the buyback i mean you have a 500million buyback out there thats a big number i think you can repurchase about of the company over the next couple of years is the right way to think about it that you guys will utilize the full million over the next couple of years or do you think thats too big of an assumption william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah i think as weve talked about before brady its always going to be opportunistic repurchases we did million this quarter at an average price of sic so we felt pretty good about that we want to put our capital into loan growth we would have thought that cet1 would have been more towards the range obviously it floated up on lower rwa we just talked about the fact that we think organic loan growth is coming back all of that to say is we are bullish on ourselves and so we do expect to continue to opportunistically repurchase shares and whether its over the next couple of quarters or the next years using most or all of that authorization is our expectation brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great again i didnt know about aarti so aarti youll be missed and congrats on the new spot it was great working with you over the years good luck d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thanks brady operator next question is from michael rose from raymond james please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions just trying to get a sense for the margin trajectory here i appreciate the disclosure on the purchase accounting accretion and things like that how does the ph pppcs kind of look and then on a core basis if you strip out ppp and paa what would be the kind of near term expectation thanks william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee hi michael good morning its bj so ill start ill give you kind of an overall view of our ppp trajectory that may help so in terms of round one we expect that of those will be forgiven by sometime in the third quarter of first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2021 this year so i think we originated something along the lines of billion to of that gone by third quarter and therefore all the fees associated with that accelerated and collected by that on round two were at about billion or so and well probably climb a little bit more of that we assume that those fees will be accretive over the next years or so so hopefully that gives you a little bit of color on ppp in terms of net interest income and the trajectory they are based on my commentary earlier around a little bit more optimism on loan growth in the backhalf of the year our continued focus on driving down deposit cost where we can where we have a little bit more opportunity and the libor base is hopefully flattening out here ellens knocking on wood we expect that our nii as weve said on slide might be down modestly but generally around this area and hopefully we can see a little bit of uptick towards the backhalf of the year in terms of margin we estimate that anywhere between and basis points of drag on the margin today is coming from the excess cash we certainly want to put that to work in loan growth we do expect that deposit growth will continue to remain elevated but over time start to come back out but its going to be here for a while so were focused less on the margin and more on stabilizing and starting to improve the nii trajectory michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc thats great color very helpful and maybe just as my followup weve seen a bunch of deals announced here lately in the industry you guys are well on your way with iberia whats the appetite as we move forward for additional deals if you can update us and how those priorities maybe changed just given the recent activity thanks d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee hi michael this is bryan our focus really hasnt changed as you point out were making good progress on the integration of our mergerofequals iberiabank and first horizon we feel outstanding opportunity exists in our existing franchise we see great demographics in our southern footprint great growth opportunities and so our focus is clearly on getting the merger integrated and then as we come out of the integration in the fall really start to build momentum and capitalize in these growth markets that we see out there so our priorities havent changed it really is trying to capitalize and deliver the benefits we believe that exist and the work that were doing today with our mergerofequals michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc all right great thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the new role aarti d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator the next question is from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning everyone first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2021 d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee hey steve susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to start so nice start out of the gate on revenue synergies could you give more color on the million of commercial loans youre calling out from the synergies and how are you seeing the bigger picture now for revenue synergies susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning steven its susan as it relates to revenue synergies and bj alluded to some were seeing two areas specifically early on really benefiting from the mergerofequals one is the legacy iberia specialty business which is equipment finance were seeing great opportunities across all of our markets and even within some of our other specialty lines who have equipment needs so thats going to continue to build just as a side note during a covid environment that weve already seen million in commitments related to revenue synergies i think is great and then also assetbased lending which as you know first horizon has been in that business for many many years and were seeing great referrals from our legacy iberia market and relationship managers we also believe there is an opportunity to continue to expand specific bankings within those two also i would be remiss if i didnt mention mortgage the opportunity that we now have with the legacy iberia mortgage business were seeing mortgage activity both secondary and portfolio mortgage synergies as it relates to bringing that together so were very very pleased the bankers the great thing and our bankers are so excited to have additional things that they can talk to clients about and not have those go to another institution so i feel very very confident that well continue to see that build as the economy continues to open d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee hey steve this is bryan ill add to that i think this is one of the more underappreciated opportunities in our merger i think theres a lot of revenue synergies that we would generate some of it is the obvious stuff a bigger balance sheet some of it is product set that susan just described and say for example the private client and wealth business thats an area that iberiabank is not focused on as much were having really good success hiring private bankers and wealth managers in our florida footprint for example so we look at this area from a big picture perspective we captured or tracked million and then sort of stopped on the capital bank merger several years ago we think this opportunity of combining these two organizations and bringing this combined product set bigger balance sheets the opportunity to do more for our customers we think were going to well exceed the million of revenue synergies over the next couple of years that weve created in our capital bank merger first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2021 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful bryan a big picture question for you so you guys are delivering on the cost saves from iberia the revenue synergies are starting to come through countercyclical businesses are doing their job i know is a bit of an odd year given the pandemic and you have ppp program stimulus et cetera all impacting loan demand but from a big picture view could you talk about how do you see growth potential of this new company over the longerterm is this a mid singledigit grower or is this a high singledigit grower what do you see for us thanks d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah thats a good question you didnt stipulate what you think the economy is going to do when we come out of all this stimulus i think we are going to have a footprint and a demographic that is going to grow at or above what you see in peers and others as i look at our footprint you think about the markets were in and were in atlanta houston dallas miami were in of the top msas in the south prepandemic the south was growing faster than the us as a whole postpandemic i think that has probably accelerated and if you look at those markets in many cases we have a very focused and in some ways smaller presence but we see a tremendous opportunity to take that focus and expand that presence so the work that michael brown and our bankers are doing today to position us through hiring et cetera i think were going to be in a position that we will clearly grow better than average and indiscernible i think over time that the growth in the us economy is going to return back to that to area so i think that would dictate that we probably be in more than midsingle digits but i think the easier way to describe it is i think we will do better than most in terms of being able to deliver growth given where were positioned the focus of our bankers and the product set that we offer steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats very helpful color and best of luck to aarti as well thanks guys d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thanks steve operator the next question is from john pancari from evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee hey john first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2021 susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee hi john john pancari q analyst evercore isi and first off best of luck to aarti as well in your new gig on the excess cash side i believe youre sitting on about billion in excess and i just want to see if you can give us just a little bit more color on how youre thinking about the deployment there i know you indicated it in the loan growth opportunities but outside of that where do you see opportunities are you looking at the bond portfolio any differently these days or do you see any nonportfolio purchases or areas like that thanks william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee hey john so i see it in a couple of different ways one is we are optimistic that loan growth is going to come back into the some of this excess cash so thats priority number one number two i think over time theres going to be a reduction in deposit balances as the stimulus rolls off as economic activity picks up commercial clients will go to cash holdings first then lending second so i think theres a lot of activity to see a little bit above to that but i think deposit levels will come down because of that as well on the securities portfolio we did modestly increase it this quarter and well look for opportunities to deploy that but i wouldnt expect that were going to significantly increase the securities portfolio were really looking more at deploying it on the loan growth side so as i said before yeah of course wed like to put excess cash to work but this is a highclass problem to have its really just hurting the nim and not really hurting our nii so to me deploying it is all upside john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thanks bj thats helpful and then separately on the a lot of focus around the countercyclical businesses here certainly doing your job i agree but i guess if you could just talk about the outlook for each in terms of the capital markets business you saw a million adr this quarter certainly a high level where do you see that going just given the backdrop here on the rate side and then separately i guess also on the mortgage warehouse business if you can give us an outlook there as well given the rate dynamics thanks william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee sure so starting on fixed income million was very very strong in the quarter we expect continued strength maybe not there but maybe more in the million somewhere between the million and million where were at this quarter 90plus percent of the business days last quarter we had million days across the desks that is very very strong so allin like weve said in our outlook on slide we expect that strength to continue but maybe not quite at the million level that we saw this quarter on loans to mortgage companies as you would know we do see seasonal declines in the first quarter we do expect some pickup in the second spring volume season happens into the third as well so we do expect a little bit of a pickup from firstquarter levels so that will help drive some of the loan growth that we see in the backhalf of the year first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2021 susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee john also we in mortgage warehouse we indiscernible has done a great job of continuing to add clients but just in the last two years the client count has grown at about so weve got more clients that are working with us and obviously when the business is flat we flex the lines up and wed like to be the first bank they come to when they need indiscernible for their clients for mortgage lending so we think were wellpositioned because of the good clientele here as well john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thank you operator the next question is from brock vandervliet from ubn sic ubs please go ahead brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thank you just following up on johns question bj it sounds like youre relatively cautious given the rate environment on securities which i understand we are seeing some of your peers particularly those with no mortgage banking operations simply retain more on the residential side in this environment especially if they can avail themselves to jumbo or nonqm something with a steppedup rate is that part of your strategy here william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee hey brock yes so going back to a couple of questions ago where i was kind of talking about loan growth outlook on the consumer side youre exactly right we did make some changes to some of the portfolio products to try to position them more attractively for our affluent clients but then also our retail clients in general and like i said theres a lot of pipeline in the last days for portfolio production its up pretty pretty significantly so yes we are looking to put a little bit more on the portfolio on the securities side just to give you a little bit more color i mean the yields that were seeing right now coming on the portfolio would be in the range with a fiveyear duration so were trying to pick our spots there but wed rather do what we just talked about which is increase portfolio production serve more clients particularly on the employment side give our bankers more to talk to our clients about it and thats exactly what were going to do brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah this is bryan brock and as you think about the alternatives for investing this excess cash if youre doing anything in securities portfolio or mortgages youre adding duration and so our preference has always to use our balance sheet for building customer relationships and at least in the mortgage products which you have the relationship opportunity either to expand it or solidify it you dont get that securities portfolio so well always look for opportunities if were going to add duration and add it to our loan book first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2021 brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it and just as a followup i think the only thing thats rebounded more than bank stocks in the last year has been oil prices i didnt hear you mention that as a source of incremental growth could you talk about that area obviously a focal point in the past for the bank is it a question of seeing a different risk reward here or other concerns or how are you thinking about energy d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah this is bryan thats an important business i mentioned in the growth markets that were in i mentioned dallas and houston clearly and texas is an important product set and we are in all likelihood is going to have continued presence in the energy lending all likelihood that exposure will be flat to downish we expect that those portfolios will come down some and that we will reduce our exposure a little bit over time we think its important to be in those markets and to facilitate lending in oilfield services in ep and so on and so forth but we also think its a very volatile place to land and so were not going to increase our exposures in all likelihood were going to focus it much more on how do we support the commercial businesses in both of those markets brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thank you good color operator the next question is from jennifer demba from truist securities please go ahead jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee good morning jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc most of my questions have been asked but bryan two questions i assume that when loan demand does return more the competition is going to be quite challenging given all the excess liquidity in the system im just wondering how you guys are thinking about that and then my second question is when do you think we will know what the real estate implications are going to be from the shift to more working from home for the banking industrys employees thanks d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee yeah thanks jennifer first on loan demand youre absolutely right it is a very competitive environment and probably becomes more competitive every day i would argue that youve got competition around pricing obviously and duration or term but youre also starting to see more competition around structure we are being first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2021 mindful of how and where we compete where focus is as weve pointed out a couple of times in the prepared comments on the strength and stability of our balance sheet and were also mindful that growing with our customers and protecting our customer base is important so were being very thoughtful on a transactionby transaction basis and were trying not to draw a whole bunch of bright lines other than lets make sure that were booking assets and serving our customers in a way that will be good for our customers through the longterm it will be good for our balance sheet through the longterm with respect to real estate and susan will have probably some additional comments i think that scenario is going to take a little while to unfold if you take us as an example were working through now how and when we return to the office over the next three or four months and we expect that we will be bringing the vast majority of those that are working from home but you have to keep in mind about half of our people or more are in the office today whether its in a banking center or whether its in an operation center or a technology center et cetera so were looking at return to work we think that theres going to be some shortterm impact on commercial real estate as i focus on it today im more focused on can we see the returns that are opening in some of the businesses like hospitality and restaurant services where we need to get workers back to come back at full capacity so i think more the shortterm stress in commercial real estate is are we going to be able to get properties opened because we can get housekeeping and food servers and so on and so forth back to work i think the commercial real estate sector will probably level out over time as more people come back to the office i think there are tremendous amount of benefit for people being together at least if not with more flexibility but more together so that you get the communication the collaboration the culture all the things that go along with interacting with one another susan i dont know if you want to add anything at all susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee yeah ill add a few things just around office in general as bryan and bj both said earlier we are in very attractive markets in the south and we have seen even during the pandemic and still as were emerging out of it interest in companies that essentially have been relocating into some of the markets that were in places like raleigh south florida atlanta birmingham houston dallas to name more than a few so even if office space in the big picture does become somewhat of an issue we believe were wellpositioned because of the markets that were in the other thing i would say jennifer is that weve remained very consistent and prudent in our underwriting across office and the average price equity in our office portfolio is in excess of i think we dont have huge loans just one office building is our average loan size and that portfolio is about million and then were diversified across our own geography florida north carolina tennessee texas georgia louisiana would be our topselling six markets which is what you would expect based on our footprint so based on our underwriting the potential for good things in our portfolio i think is greater than others because of the markets that were in and the way that we underwrite those loans prior to the changes jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2021 operator the next question is from christopher marinac from janney montgomery scott please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks you may have mentioned this earlier this morning i just want to go back to the loan yields and comparing kind of new business going forward compared to what the core yield was im just looking at the details on slide william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah hey its bj chris so on new production on the commercial side were seeing a yield in high lets say blended across variable and fixed on the consumer side its going to be a little bit higher than that in the low but thats what were seeing today so repositioning of the book in terms of new production is going to be a little bit less than what we see which obviously is going to put pressure on the margin again i think as volume starts to pick up in the backhalf of the year so hopefully we can mitigate some of that but hopefully that gives you a little bit our view d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee hey chris this is bryan with respect to coming out of a pandemic and all of the uncertainty that that created you wouldnt expect to see spreads compressing at the pace that they are and as i suggested in my response to jennifers question a minute ago theres a lot of competition and a lot of that competition is manifesting itself in spreads and unfortunately we think that we in the industry are looking at tighter spreads for some period of time here as theres so much excess liquidity after trying to get deployed in loan growth christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc no i appreciate that thank you for the additional color and then just bj just a followup on the gain on sales spread in the mortgage business are there any technology improvements that essentially help too on the cost side that as time evolves that the gain on sales spread may not come back as much as it historically did william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee chris when you say come back as much what do you mean christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc well i mean just comparing where we are today at compared to being in the or a year ago william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah i mean i think there are significant process improvements that were working on in the mortgage business its kind of hard to deal with that right now when you have so much volume but we have a lot of things that were trying to do to keep those spreads up higher but i do think that our expectation is theyll continue to moderate more towards maybe the range this year but it remains to be seen because as you know theres a lot of first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2021 moving parts that go into the gain on sales spread but theyve been pretty healthy over the last three quarters at least and so we expect that to be above somewhat the historical levels for another couple quarters christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great bj thanks again d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator the next question is from jared shaw from wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning this is actually timur braziler filling in for jared d bryan jordan a president chief executive officer director first horizon corp tennessee hi timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc good morning my first question is a followup to your response to johns question on excess liquidity just looking at the deposit book is there a way to gauge how much of that could potentially come out as borrowers start to engage in the capex activity and using their own balance sheets to do that and is it going to take years for the excess liquidity to get back towards normalized level or do you foresee that being a quicker process william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah we try to do that analysis in terms of how much of a indiscernible come out over time just to give you maybe a little bit of context of how i think about it our excess cash position for a company our size should be more than the million to billion range in any given quarter were in billion right now so i dont think that billion of excess cash comes out over the next couple quarters i think its going to take some period of time for it to be to be soaked up so i think excess cash positions are going to be here for a while with that said i dont expect it to continue to be at the 10billion level i expect it to continue to fall based on increased loan growth increased usage of those excess cash balances particularly our commercial clients to burn off of stimulus checks on the consumer side et cetera so but i think its going to be here to stay for a while timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then as a followup maybe switching gears and looking at credit and the reserve position so credit obviously was very clean this quarter to what extent or qualitative overlay is still being applied to maybe slow down what otherwise would have been a larger reduction in the reserve and as we look ahead barring any changes in the credit picture should we expect to see accelerating declines in the allowance level first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2021 susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee we are feeling very good about the credit outlook as it relates to coming out of the pandemic were talking with clients and with bankers were really starting to see a lot of renewed activity come back to that level so were optimistic although again theyre still waiting to see additional vaccinations et cetera and some states indiscernible completely but we do based on what we know now and what ive seen in portfolios i would expect that well see additional reserve releases throughout the remainder of the year william c losch iii a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah i agree ive said in my earlier comments that based on what were seeing and the economic outlook and i mean we have said for quite some time that we significantly repositioned this credit portfolio since the financial crisis and its showing up at the very low levels of chargeoffs weve got so all of that to say were at coverage ratios and prepandemic on a combined basis we would have been at that implies excuse me that weve got pretty significant reserve releases assuming that the economy continues to improve so do we get back there by the end of this year probably not but do we get that closure to maybe first or second quarter levels by the end of this year yes probably timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats great color thank you operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference
