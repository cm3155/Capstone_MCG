our third quarter results reflect the quality of our franchise and we have highlighted some of our key strengths on slide over the past five months i have become increasingly confident in our ability to serve our customers and communities and deliver strong shareholder returns our team of associates are highly experienced weve retained of our talent over the past year who have been with us over nine years on average we have an extraordinary client base thats been with us a long time with a median tenure of years our teams dedication to serving clients is the key driver of our ability to retain of our clients over this past year with our experienced bankers focus on excellent customer service and our ability to deploy capital through loan and deposit growth were seeing solid momentum in our businesses right now im grateful for the hard work of our associates as they deliver value for our clients communities and shareholders on slide are some of the financial highlights from this quarter which hope will cover with you in more detail we delivered adjusted eps of per share on pretax preprovision net revenue of million resulting in a return on tangible common equity of our results were impacted by an idiosyncratic chargeoff of million first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 that we communicated earlier this quarter this credit loss was related to a company who unexpectedly converted from a chapter to chapter bankruptcy otherwise the balance sheet continues to perform very well period end deposits are up billion or from the last quarter as we continue to have success in acquiring customers throughout our deposit franchise and campaigns we opened over new deposit accounts this quarter bringing in billion in balances with over a third of the balances going into checking products our loan todeposit ratio improved to as deposit growth outpaced loan growth of just under these are relatively flat to the prior quarter as our countercyclical businesses have stabilized at cyclical lows so we need to make some investments over the next year or two we have a proven track record of managing our expense base and well be disciplined in our reinvestment strategy our capital position continued to be very strong with our cet1 ratio flat to the prior quarter at as we look toward we will be evaluating our options to ph repatriate capital to our shareholders with an eye toward a longerterm cet1 ratio range of to overall the sentiment of our bankers and clients remains cautious but positive inflation and labor supply continue to be a challenge however the economies in our footprint are performing well additionally we recently released the results of our most recent stress test which demonstrated our capacity to maintain capital levels well in excess of regulatory minimums even in the feds severely indiscernible in short given our stable diversified business mix attractive footprint and the strong credit culture we feel confident in our ability to profitably navigate any economic scenario our experienced team has a proven track record of delivering high quality service to meet our clients and communities needs this yields longtenured deep relationships that enable us to produce top quartile returns over the cycle with that ill hand the call over to hope to run through this quarters financial results hope hope dmuchowski chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee thank you bryan good morning everyone turning to slide we provide adjusted financials and key performance metrics for the quarter we generated ppnr of million down modestly from second quarter the main driver was a million decline in net interest income driven by higher deposit costs fees and expenses are relatively stable to the prior quarter as bryan already mentioned we experienced an idiosyncratic credit loss of million which drove the ph million increase in provision expense to million in the quarter this single credit impacted adjusted earnings per share by approximately other chargeoffs of million were in line with the prior quarters tangible book value per share came in at with adjusted earnings per share of partially offsetting the impact of higher marks on securities and hedges and of dividend on slide we outline a couple of notable items in the quarter which reduced our results by per quarter third quarter notable items include a pretax restructuring expense of million related to streamlining our market structure in addition to some reductions in force primarily within mortgage as we continue to look at operational efficiencies within our businesses to offset increasing cost in addition to the tax impact of the restructuring there are two notable tax items a million tax liability related to the book value surrender of approximately million of separate account boli this was triggered by the fitch downgrade of the us from aaa to aa which caused noncompliance with the underlying investment guidelines of the ph rap provider lower corporate tax rates and higher interest rates made the surrender of the policy the most attractive option to exit this low yielding asset and redeploy the cash into higher yielding and more liquid alternatives partially offsetting this is an million of tax benefits primarily related to amended returns on prior acquisitions first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 on slide i will walk through net interest income and margin nii of million and net interest margin of remained strong despite moderating from cyclical highs interestbearing deposit costs increased basis points partially driven by a full quarter impact of the second quarter deposit campaign offsetting this increase was a partial quarter benefit of the july rate hike on floating rate assets as we remain asset sensitive in fourth quarter we will have the opportunity to reprice the promotional money market accounts acquired in second quarter as well as the full benefit of julys rate hike giving us the ability to improve our nii and margin from third quarters level the cumulative interestbearing deposit beta reached this quarter we expect this to be the high watermark for us in this cycle our success in continuing to grow customer deposits enabled the payoff of all remaining fhlb borrowings this quarter over time margin will also benefit from the continued repricing of fixed rate cash flows and widening credit spreads as two thirds of our loan portfolio is floating rate we remain wellpositioned to benefit in a rising rate environment as you can see on slide were still seeing strong inflows from our deposit campaign period end deposits were up from last quarter demonstrating our ability to expand market share as the feds h8 data shows deposit is essentially flat for the industry as a whole deposit growth was driven by new customer acquisition and deepening existing relationships we opened over newtobank deposit accounts bringing over billion including approximately million of checking account balances the average rate on our new customer deposits was down over basis points from our second quarter promotional rate additionally the customer we brought in during last quarters promotion increased their balances by approximately million the full quarter impact of the successful deposit campaign and a higher fed funds rate drove an increase in interestbearing deposit costs from in  to in  with our strong liquidity position our focus is on primacy we are launching a promotional cash offer for checking accounts that meet primacy benchmarks over time for customers acquired in the second quarter the rate guarantees on money markets will come up for repricing in the back half of the fourth quarter we will have the opportunity to moderate funding costs as we focus on converting from ph promo to primacy on slide youll see that period end loans of billion were up million or linked quarter loans to mortgage companies declined million due to seasonality and the impact on volumes from higher mortgage rates loan growth was diversified across our markets and portfolios ci growth was diversified across multiple industries geographies and lines of businesses cre growth was largely driven by fundups from existing loans primarily in multifamily while commitments remained flat we have focused our on balance sheet mortgage production on the medical doctor program with over of new balances coming through that channel this quarter this has been an attractive vertical for us as we can deepen these relationships with wealth management and other products our bankers are focused on expanding spreads and deepening relationships through increased crosssell of depository treasury and wealth management products spreads on new fundings have increased almost basis points since last quarter and approximately basis points yearoveryear i will cover fee income trends on slide fee income is stable at million versus million in the prior quarter however excluding deferred compensation fee income increased by million other noninterest income was up million including an increase of million in fhlb dividends from higher borrowing levels last quarter and a million increase in swap fees again ill reiterate we have paid off all of our fhlb borrowings in  with the newtobank customer deposits our countercyclical fee businesses are stabilizing near the cyclical lows we saw a modest decrease of million in fixed income with average daily revenues down due to the first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 challenging market conditions mortgage banking income was up million as we slightly modified our pricing strategy to drive volume into the secondary market moving on to expenses on slide excluding deferred compensation adjusted expenses are up million this is largely driven by the million of mergerrelated retention expenses moving into core results this quarter personnel expenses declined or million and there are a couple of different moving parts first deferred compensation declined by million which is offset in the corresponding fee income line second as i previously mentioned the geography change of the million of mergerrelated retention expense moving into core results lastly we had an million reduction in other variable compensation other expenses were up million as the prior quarter included the benefit of a few discrete nonrecurring items which included lower franchise and realty taxes with the challenging economic environment expense discipline remains a focus and we continue to look for operational efficiencies within our business this quarter we restructured our regional banks by consolidating into two fewer regions and moderated our mortgage business our efficiency ratio was at in  i will cover asset quality in reserves on slide loan loss provision increased by million from  to million in  the increase was driven by a single ci chargeoff of million this loan was a shared national credit where we were the lead bank we initially anticipated a recovery through a chapter bankruptcy sale however there was an unexpected conversion to chapter in august at which point we charged off the full amount of the loan we did not have a specific reserve for this credit as we had an updated third party valuation that supported our carrying value and we anticipated an imminent sale within the quarter we are working with outside counsel to identify evaluate and pursue potential recoveries at this time we have no estimate of the timing or ultimate amount of recoveries if any total chargeoffs were million in  excluding the idiosyncratic loss chargeoffs would have been million in line with the prior quarter acl coverage ratio increased basis point to reflecting loan growth and continued caution around the macroeconomic outlook the vacancy rate in our office cre portfolio is which compares favorably to the industry which is experiencing vacancy of in the southeast like others we are seeing credit normalize from historically low loss levels during the pandemic though commercial credit can be variable we do not expect significant broadbased deterioration in our portfolios on slide you can see that we continue to have exceptionally strong capital level our cet1 ratio of remained flat to the prior quarter even as we organically deployed capital to loan growth even after adjusting for the marks on our security portfolio and loan book our proforma cet1 ratio would be tangible book value per share was in  a slight decrease from the prior quarter due to a reduction from higher ph marktomarket impact that were partially offset by of adjusted niac total capital also remain very strong at on slide we have made a couple of tweaks to our outlook though we continue to believe that ppnr will be within the guidance we gave at investor day in june we updated our loan growth expectations from to to to as our success in raising deposits has enabled us to organically deploy excess capital into meeting our clients borrowing needs and strategically acquiring new clients the net chargeoff outlook is updated to include this quarters idiosyncratic loss but we expect other chargeoffs to be within prior guidance the new capital range ph rwa impact of the updated loan guidance this assumes no share buybacks but as bryan mentioned we intend to evaluate capital deployment as we head into to wrap up on slide i am very proud of how this team navigated so far with passion and commitment to our clients despite the macroeconomic environment and the unique challenges we have faced our success in client retention and acquisition would not be possible without the consistent focus of our associates that they have first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 on serving our clients through any cycle or challenge we are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities of our diversified business model highly attractive franchise and asset sensitive balance sheet we are making strategic investments to support clients with products services and technology upgrades that will result in improved efficiency we will continue to look for operational efficiencies to offset our investments we remain committed to delivering attractive returns for shareholders through the cycle now i will hand it back to bryan d bryan jordan chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you hope i will roughly reiterate something hope said a moment ago over the course of our history we have demonstrated our ability to execute and change in sometimes unusual economic environments we know how to pull the necessary levers in order to operate profitable our footprint and our teams give me tremendous confidence in our ability to generate strong return to our shareholders while economic conditions are likely to soften somewhat i expect that we will grow revenue control expenses and record positive operating leverage next year i am confident that this company has the people the resources and the determination to do whats necessary to support our communities and shareholders throughout the economic cycle brica we can now open up the call for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions we have the first question from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i guess maybe first question just thanks for running through kind of the promotion rates where they were this quarter versus last as we think about the nii guide i guess full year or looking back into to give us a sense of how fourth quarter shakes out the higher end versus lower end of that guidance range and then as we think about moving forward you still have promotional ph cds or promotional deposits rolling off just if this should this be the ph trough in nii and that growth continues through at least the first half of is that the right way to think about it and again the to could it what makes it versus hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 thank you ebrahim for many questions in one ill try to get all of them covered apologies if i miss one you can hold me accountable first we have not updated our ranges to a very specific percentage but we expect next quarter to look similar to current quarter trends with the exception of nii that we do expect to increase and non interest margin net interest margin that we do expect to increase next quarter as were able to take advantage of the expanding yields and lower deposit costs our investor day guidance that we reiterate here we believe well end up on a ppnr basis right in the middle of that with revenue being a little bit towards the lower side as well as expenses coming in on the lower side on how we think about sorry go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc no go ahead hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee as to how we think about going into next quarter and next year as we said in our prepared remarks we continue to be focused on disciplined lending and bringing down our core deposit rates that we did as weve talked about multiple times in  we went out with a very large promotion in order to reenergize our franchise our bankers and our clients and we plan to walk those rates back and i believe that the ph billion mix that we were able to bring in in the quarter at indiscernible shows that were able to acquire new clients and walk back existing client rates ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for that and just a separate question so i completely get this the credit that you had this quarter was very decent credit but bryan youve done a ton of heavy lifting postgfc in cleaning up this balance sheet and as you went through this credit does this did that cause you to revisit the loan book to look at some of the larger credits kind of do another deep dive on the portfolio review to make sure there are no other kind of big chunky surprises just talk to us about that susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee ebrahim this is susan springfield ill take that and then hope and bryan can add any comments during really any economic downturn we take an opportunity to do portfolio reviews across sectors as well as markets so we are doing that for all of our lines of business especially in lines as well as regional banks the other thing is any time we have any kind of loss we do a i call it a ph spilled milk analysis to look at were there things that we could have done differently whether that was the original underwriting servicing timing communication et cetera so we obviously do take that very seriously and are in the process of evaluating anything that could be improved related to the outcome of that credit with that being said i do feel that both bryan and hope indicated very good about the portfolio we have a history of strong client selection being consistent and conservative in our underwriting and staying on top of our servicing d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee i would add to susans comments that as the economy has started to tighten and financial conditions have slowed down to some extent our interest cost is going to have impact and so when you see those things happen as first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 soon as that we not only continue what we typically do in terms of credit monitoring we do some focused reviews and we expect that credit will soften some but we think we start in an extraordinarily good place with strong borrower selection strong underwriting and credit structure and ultimately strong collateral values so we have as susan said an effort that we undertook to understand what happened with this one individual idiosyncratic credit and we will learn from that but we believe the fundamentals of our credit selection underwriting and delivery process will position us very well for our economy thats likely to soften some over the course of the next year or so ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator thank you your next question comes from casey haire with jefferies your line is now open casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thanks good morning everyone i wanted to touch on expenses so if im looking at the guide i mean yeartodate theyre up versus last year and you guys are still talking holding to that ph to which would imply a pretty big stepup in the fourth quarter is that accurate or is that guide conservative and then yeah ill start there hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee casey thank you for the question i would say reiterating my response to ebrahim on expenses were probably going to be on the low side we are trying to deploy a lot of new projects and technology that have not yet come into our run rate some of those will start in  and then the bigger unknown is really where our cyclical business is ph half  they have such a variable revenue base and so even though were at we have set at pretty low levels for fhn and we are expecting a little bit of an uptick in  that would drive that expense up casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay it feels like you would have to come in below that unless anyway okay and then bryan just following up on your comments about positive operating leverage next year i believe at your investor day you were talking about yeah expenses being up another ph next year is that your hope for positive operating leverage in does that still contemplate that expense guide or is there a possibility to flex that lower d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee well i do think expenses will be up somewhat next year part of it is what hope just talked about in terms of the reinvestment in the franchise and making some investments in technology and then really doing some of the remedial work that we have talked about in the past with that said i do still believe that we can drive positive operating leverage im very optimistic in our ability to continue to drive loan growth and particularly wider spreads first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 on our lending portfolios and as hope mentioned the couple of different times and ways we think we have the ability to bring the cost of deposits down over the course of the next year so all of that said i think expenses can be up were not going to spend a dollar that we dont need to spend and so were going to control expenses at the end of the day though i think we can still generate with even slightly higher expenses positive operating leverage casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good and just lastly on the capital return you guys obviously warming up to the buyback is what it sounds like to me just wondering what is you guys have been fairly consistent on this front and saying like its just not the time macrowise just given all the uncertainty its not as if that uncertainty is going to improve into im just wondering what is driving that decision to more increased appetite for a share buyback d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah i think its fair to sort of break it into two pieces one we said longer term in the prepared comments it would probably be in that to range and i think thats probably a fair way to think about our business through varying economic cycles as we sit here today were a little north of and i think as we look at we may not bring it down much below or into that range but we dont believe that we need to let that capital continue to accumulate so depending on what happens with the balance sheet in terms of any growth we think theres still excess capital to repatriate to shareholders and hold those ratios in this current area that theyre in today so we think we can do both maintain strong capital levels which are important in an economic situation thats probably less certain than any of us might like and at the same time we dont need to let that capital base continue to grow from here in our view casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thank you d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you casey operator your next question comes from the line of michael rose of raymond james your line is now open michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions just following up on the last two on ebrahims and caseys questions i guess what im trying to what im struggling with here is the ability to actually drive positive operating leverage especially if countercyclical businesses specifically in mortgage and fixed income are going to be under pressure and it does look like well or fixed income will be under continued pressure under a higher for longer scenario so hope maybe if you can just help us kind of understand the drivers of how you actually drive positive operating leverage because i think thats something that were all struggling with im certainly getting some emails thanks first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee michael good to hear from you and i appreciate the third question and ill try to answer it as well as i can with a little bit more detail i think casey said it that its going to be hard for us to hit the ph to expenses bryan followed up with we are looking for ways to drive down expenses were only months post the deal termination and were relooking at our franchise and trying to figure out how we make investments and how we offset that this quarter we reorganized two of our regions we downsized our mortgage business we are continuing to look at how can we bring back deposit cost so were going to be able to increase margin in future quarters we believe that this is our high watermark for the cost side of margin were going to see we do expect that our on business will have a better year in than as we see stabilization in rates next year and we are going to continue to keep a disciplined focus on expenses were just in the cycle now as looking at what will be from a budget perspective and were looking at every opportunity to bring down expenses and drive revenue i would love to give you guidance we just need a little bit more time to finalize everything but i think you should see the regional bank restructure that we did as well as the mortgage of us getting out pretty quickly the first full quarter after a deal was terminated and looking at how we can run our businesses more efficiently and redeploy that to investment to improve the client experience michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and then just stepping back indiscernible hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee and michael one other note ill mention sorry go ahead michael you go michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc no go ahead hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee when we look at the retention expenses coming back to core i know we mentioned this on a prior quarter and it came off at barclays as well the yearoveryear increase in that is only million so even though we only have a half year this year in core and a full year next year because the first portion pays out at may it is not as big of a yearoveryear increase as i think some of you have in your model i think you guys were taking the million and assuming that was almost double next year as we look at the expense that i see in your models i think you guys were overweighting that piece michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay helpful and then again i know its too hard for at this point but i mean is there an expectation just broadly that you can actually grow nii i certainly understand all the tailwinds as it relates to the margin but is that actually baked into at least preliminary expectations first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee in the current rate scenario yes we believe flat to up is strong for us we do have a rate curve that has continuing increases for the year and no decreases and being asset sensitive that is positive to our nii michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc all right thanks for taking my questions d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thanks michael operator the next question comes from brody preston of ubs your line is open brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey hey good morning everyone d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hope sorry to beat a dead horse but i just wanted to put a finer point on the expenses to get to the low end of your guidance range i need to step expenses up to million for the fourth quarter so million linked quarter increase which seems steep if not kind of like numerically impossible to kind of flex the model that high so can you tell me why like specifically what is going to drive the million increase to get to the low end of the guidance hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee yeah i think the low end of the guidance will also round up to right or and so as we look at it were sitting here at about and were still havent seen a lot of our technology projects start and again we have a variable compensation model fhn were sitting at a quarter that was a kind of a low watermark for them and we are expecting increased revenue there which calls for an increased compensation we also have additional marketing campaigns tied to our new checking account program that we just launched as well as acquiring new deposits brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc and is there anything left from the deferred compensation from the td deal that still needs to work its way into the run rate and if so can you tell me what the dollar amount is there first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thats in the fourth quarter its in the same basically the same zip code that you had in the third quarter about million incremental in the third quarter expense base and it should be about the same in the fourth quarter brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you for that do you guys ph happen to have with the spot interestbearing deposit rate was at ph and then youve talked about kind of moderating deposit costs from here do you have a view on where you expect that spot rate to move to by ph hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee we do have the current spot rates at ph and we are looking to walk that down i dont want to put a rate out there every time i put a beta out there a rate out there we seem to miss it so far weve missed our beta guidance and our rate guidance so weve been able to raise deposits quicker we do have almost billion repricing in  related to the money we brought on in  with the deposit campaign and so i think it really ties to how quickly what our ability is to walk that back as well as bring new deposits in if we can continue to bring them in at a ph million average rate well be able to walk it back a lot more but most of that reprices in the second half of november and december so we really got to see what our ability is but were seeing some steep competition on deposit pricing and so how that changes how our competitors change their deposit pricing from now until november and december when ours reprice will really kind of generate how much i think we can walk it back d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee the other big factor to hopes comment is the shift in mix is running those from noninterestbearing to interest bearing that naturally moves that cost up as well so its there are a lot of levers to play we think in the aggregate is as hope highlighted in our prepared comments the new money that we brought in in the third quarter was on a mix basis significantly lower than it was in the second quarter in terms of the blended cost and we think its just the deposit promo weve started to reprice we have the opportunity to bring those cost down more in line with where weve been bringing in new balances on over time brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and maybe switching gears for the in the loan portfolio do you happen to have what your exposure is to shared national credits and of that what portion are you the lead lender on natalie r flanders a senior vice president headinvestor relations first horizon corp tennessee yeah so weve got that information in terms of shared national credits as a percent of the portfolio it represents about less than of our balances and we are the lead on about around to of that brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 okay great and thank you very much natalie and then the last one for me before i hop was just a twoparter on the office exposure specifically on the nonmedical office do you happen to have what the allowances that you have set aside against the nonmedical office currently and then do you have a sense for what the average ltv on those properties are natalie r flanders a senior vice president headinvestor relations first horizon corp tennessee so we dont i dont have it broken out in that detail in terms of the allowance but in terms of our loantovalues on office youre talking about nonmedical office correct brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc yeah thats correct natalie r flanders a senior vice president headinvestor relations first horizon corp tennessee just the traditional office so our portfolio today on traditional office stuff the average upfront equity we have is about and on a stabilized loantovalue basis were at about brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you very much everyone i appreciate you taking my questions d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thanks brody operator thank you we now have brady gailey of kbw you may proceed when youre ready brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you good morning guys d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee hey brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc weve had two big quarters of deposit growth which has been good to see its helped lower your loantodeposit ratio how should we think about that going forward in and as we head into next year are you still targeting to have deposit growth outpace loan growth and is there a target you have in mind as far as where you want to get your loantodeposit ratio first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee well its an interesting discussion hope and i talked about the loantodeposit ratio we clearly want to grow deposits and i would say its less about the balances than it is the relationship its customer acquisition to us and we want to be in a position to continue to broaden and deepen and grow customer relationships our loanto deposit ratio ended the quarter at about and if you blend that thats probably a little bit higher than peers but if you throw on securities which we tend to have a relative much smaller relative portfolio were sort of right in line we think to the extent that we can grow relationships and we can grow deposits it gives us the fuel to continue to support customer needs on the credit side as well and so we are not proactively as much managing the loantodeposit ratio as we are trying to proactively manage our ability to serve our customers and our communities in a profitable fashion so id say at the end of the day if we have the opportunity to grow attractively priced deposits and relationships absolutely were going to continue to do that hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee brady what i will add to that is we are we feel like were in a great place because we have now two quarters of deposit growth weve shown that we can do it and we also have a capital position that allows us to deploy that we dont have to build capital build our capital base so our ability to continue to grow deposits and deploy that into a higher yielding loan is what were looking at ph loantodeposit ratio as bryan said when we add securities and theyre right at the peer median we feel really good about the trajectory were on which is why we believe that we will improve our margin in the coming quarters d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee and one final point is look were fortunate in the fact that we get to do business in great markets great economies and on a relative basis we think that they will outperform the us economy so were i think were in a good spot to see positive momentum in our deposit base brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc its good to be in the south i agree and then just my last question is to follow up on your comments about buyback into if i heard you correctly it sounds like instead of getting common equity tier down to that to you kind of just want to hold it relatively flat at did i understand that correct and then what would it take for you to consider a more elevated level of buyback that could potentially get that common equity tier number down into your range is it more economic uncertainty or what would you like to see to take that lower d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah thats what you said is a rough approximation of what i said which is that as we look at it today were likely to keep that cet1 ratio given the board support at a constant level around that area area to bring it down further i think we and the board would have to be confident that we had greater certainty about the direction of the economy and how things were more likely to play out so its not to say that thats completely off the table but as we sit here today it still feels like in terms of indiscernible economic outlook is still a little more uncertain than we would like we dont see it as extremely negative we just see it as more uncertain than we think maintaining a strong capital base tends to be more in our favor than bringing it down prematurely first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay got it thanks bryan d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee all right thanks brady operator we now have steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everyone this is anthony elian on for steve in the second quarter you added about billion in deposits from the new campaigns and then you added another billion in as the rates on these campaigns move lower in how confident are you that you can retain both these deposit balances as well as most more importantly the overall client relationships that youve added d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah so we recognize that when you attract new customer relationships i think the number was something like in the second quarter about of those being retail i think it was about new bank accounts in the third quarter that not only is it important that you attract a new relationship that you broaden and deepen it and our bankers all across our markets are working every single day to broaden and deepen the relationships with those new customer relationships new bank customers so we have a high degree of confidence that we will retain a significant portion of those i dont sit around and think were going to retain every one of them but we have a high degree of confidence that we can broaden and deepen with a significant number of those relationships anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then total deposit growth was really strong in the quarter supported by the campaigns but the non interestbearing deposits continued to decline on the guidance slide you point to dda balances returning to pre pandemic levels but it looks like youre very close to that level of so i guess how much more do you see to get there and by what time hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee on a prepandemic percentage youre right were at about the which is where we were but on a absolute value were about billion higher weve done the analysis of operating accounts and we think on the downside and we look at how much is in the account versus how much theyre using theres only about billion to billion of additional credit versus debit each quarter so we dont feel were not losing clients its balances that have moved to interestbearing and its clients are holding less cash in their operating accounts the inflationary environment that they have the macroeconomic environment that theyre working in they are holding less cash in operating accounts and we think if you look at the absolute value they really got to the point they were we had the exact same amount of debits and credits in every client account wed be in exactly kind of a dollarwise where we are we are working very hard to attract new dda clients as well as you mentioned we just launched a new first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 program this quarter a new marketing campaign in this current quarter and a program to go after that it is a factor of two things there which is one was the mix we saw earlier in the year and two just our clients have less cash on hand in their operating accounts these days anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then my last question at investor day you provided an rotce range of to through the cycle but your adjusted rotce this quarter was just over i know the elevated chargeoffs this quarter weighed on that but how are you thinking about the previous range of to for rotce that you provided at investor day thank you hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee yeah thats a through the cycle number and we still believe that will be the number if you look at this quarter and we take out the one chargeoff we add about back to rotce so we get closer to our range as bryan and i have talked about earlier we are looking to create positive operating leverage were looking to return capital to shareholders and so we still do run our company and look at through the cycle that being our targeted range we have no reason to believe that we cant hit that or that we should bring that down d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee as weve talked about in a number of different times were running at higher capital levels today and we believe indiscernible through the cycle range as well that has an impact on that so we still have high degree of confidence that through the cycle we can drive those to sort of mid to higher teens rotce anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator thank you we now have christopher marinac of janney montgomery scott christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks good morning i wanted to ask susan about criticized loan trends and kind of what she is seeing this quarter and also maybe what she would expect in the next few quarters looking into early susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee thanks chris we are seeing some increase in criticized assets ph but its slight at this point we are up i guess about million in terms of criticized assets quarteroverquarter and its also that we continue to have some upgrades were seeing a little bit more in commercial real estate than we are in ci but again its a first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 handful of credits im not seeing anything systemic just a kind of credit normalization at this point indiscernible christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc does that change reserve levels okay susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee yeah i mean obviously weve got a slight increase in terms of reserve coverage we were up about indiscernible christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc very well and then based on the snc information that you gave us a few minutes ago are there any other sort of like club type deals that wouldnt define as sncs that would be above and beyond that number susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee about more christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay great thank you for taking my questions this morning susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee okay thanks chris operator we now have david chiaverini of wedbush securities you may begin david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks youve previously mentioned about how youre open to doing a potential moe for scale benefits and crossing the billion in assets i was wondering what factors could accelerate a potential deal and what factors could push out a potential deal any updated thoughts there would be helpful d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah id say there are more factors pushing it out than there are bringing it in i think theyre opposite sides of the same coin in some sense but i think that the ma environment is likely to be very very minimal over the next couple of years part of that is economic part of that is interest rate marks and i still think as demonstrated over the last few quarters uncertainty about regulatory approval processes in addition to the proposed rules around basel iii and make anything unlikely in the near term and i would guess our view is its probably two years first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 three years before anywhere from a years to years before you really start to see a pickup in ma activity so thats not something thats on our radar screen today david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc makes sense thanks for that and shifting over to loan growth and the increased guidance to to i was curious what areas are you leaning into with the increased loan growth guidance susan l springfield a chief credit officer senior executive vice president first horizon corp tennessee so we do see some opportunities where other banks have pulled out completely so weve got some opportunities in mortgage warehouse lending weve got some opportunities in what i would just call indiscernible in our markets we can talk about generational opportunities to bring over the family owned companies and the markets that we continue to serve theres also some opportunities in assetbased lending one of the reasons that we think this could be attractive too is we are seeing some ability to have widening spreads and even more conservative underwriting so things like more upfront equity better covenants more opportunities to have ph guarantor and sponsor risk scores that kind of thing d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee were always opportunistic david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks very much d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee were im sorry to interrupt were always opportunistic as we think about how we grow high value relationships and thats through all economic cycles and so were always thinking about how we grow the business the other thing thats driving the growth if you look at a substantial portion of the growth in the third quarter of this year it continues to be what ive described in the past the springloaded nature of our balance sheet and that we have some continued fundup of construction assets which is driving the growth organic growth has slowed it does feel like lending activity more broadly in the economy and what we see from customers has slowed and is likely to continue to slow but we will be opportunistic and look to grow our business and to grow our customer base by using our balance sheet in appropriate ways to support customers and communities david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc helpful color thank you d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator thank you we now have jon arfstrom of rbc capital please go ahead first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah hey good morning everyone good morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc just a question on loan growth too david kind of stole my question but thats okay i guess the question for you bryan is this do you feel like this is a sustainable pace of growth this kind of to sequential growth as you look out into d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee well right now i think as i tried to mention or say articulate some of the growth is just going to be natural in the fundup of some of these construction loans as projects get completed and these are project that as susan has described continue to be on track and continue to look good so that will drive some of it in the middle of this quarter it started to feel a little more like really in the back half of this quarter it started to feel like starting to slow down in customer demand and customer activity so it does feel like things will be a bit slower but i do think theres opportunities to continue to selectively add relationships and credits and a lot of euphemisms are out there about the indiscernible and things like that were not in that mode we do think that we can use our balance sheet to support customers and communities and its one of the benefits of having a strong capital base and being in a position to compete effectively for new relationships when we see as susan described generational opportunities or otherwise to strengthen our customer pool across the entire franchise we serve jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and just somewhat related i know you were asked this at investor day but the balance sheet growth expectation at your size it feels like you have a couple of year runway and maybe you think about billion in asset threshold later but any limits on your balance sheet growth in the near term d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee no real shortterm limits i think weve got a few years of runway and if necessary we can tread water so we understand where that bright line is and were going to be very intentional about not inadvertently stumbling over that threshold so until we get greater clarity about what that regulatory landscape looks like we will do all we can to grow the balance sheet and at the same time not inadvertently stumble over it but we think weve got a few years its not an immediate concern in the near term jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good just a small one too one of the numbers that you flagged was the new checking accounts as part of the deposit campaign is that a material number to you i know its just a quarterly number and what drove that and is that repeatable first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee well its an important number because its new relationships it probably compares to about it compares to a base of around call it customer relationships so its not an insignificant number we in a given quarter will lose a few as well but it is important to know that our bankers are out there front footed that theyre acquiring customer relationships in the marketplace across the entire footprint and as i said earlier in this call clearly its not just about that first account it is we want to build a relationship i mentioned the tenure of our customer relationships we want to broaden and deepen those relationships so i guess it was the old proverb about every journey starts with the first step i mean its that first account and then we broaden and deepen from there is our goal hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee jon this is hope the other reason that weve called that out is it shows that were growing our deposit one client at a time were not out there buying big municipal fundings its not ph forward deposits were truly acquiring clients and thats why our deposits are growing i know others have indiscernible theyre talking about big chunks of money we are doing it one client at a time and because we believe the way that our franchise will excel and succeed is to bring these clients in with their first product and then sell them and make them long deep relationships that are with us for years years years years jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah yeah makes sense okay thank you very much operator thank you we now have a question from timur braziler of wells fargo securities your line is open timur q hi this is indiscernible for timur just kind of a longerterm question about your cet1 your long term cet1 target in the to range i guess has there been any preliminary work done on what that could move to if at all as if you were to cross that billion mark or is that already factored into the range provided and just how that would maybe impact your longterm capital return plans d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah we have done some very preliminary work but given the sort of state of flux of the basel iii proposals and how it impacts various tiers above the billion threshold we havent really factored that into our longterm goals at this point and if in fact we do something that puts us above that billion threshold whether its through organic growth or otherwise well update at that point q okay great and then just one clarification question on the expense guidance does the guidance for the full year assume that fdic special assessment ph hits in or has that not been included yet first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 18oct2023 hope dmuchowski a chief financial officer senior executive vp first horizon corp tennessee no we dont have that in expenses we have it as an adjusted item it is in our capital forecast but for the expense guidance were excluding that as an adjusted item q okay great thats helpful okay thats all that i had thank you very much d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator thank you as we have no further questions id like to hand it back to
