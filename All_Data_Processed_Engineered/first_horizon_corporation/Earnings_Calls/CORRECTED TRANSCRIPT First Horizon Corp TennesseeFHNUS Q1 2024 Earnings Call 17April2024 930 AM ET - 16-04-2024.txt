return on tangible common equity improved to driven by positive operating leverage as well as the benefit of returning first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 excess capital to shareholders our improved returns resulted from our ability to drive higher revenue in both our core banking franchise and our countercyclical businesses we grew the net interest margin basis points from the fourth quarter from improved pricing on both loans and deposits driving a million increase in net interest income fhn financial had a stronger quarter as well with a million increase in fixed income fees in january our board approved a million share repurchase authorization we began to return capital to shareholders this quarter repurchasing over million of stock ending the quarter with a common equity tier ratio of we will continue to opportunistically deploy capital above our nearterm target as i look forward to the rest of i remain incredibly optimistic that first horizon will continue to deliver strong results quarter after quarter while serving our customers and communities just as we have over the past years we have an attractive footprint a competitive product set and a strong credit culture that will allow us to profitably navigate the ever changing economic outlook of the upcoming year with that ill hand the call over to hope to run through our financial results in more detail hope hope dmuchowski senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you bryan good morning on slide you will find our adjusted financials and key performance metrics for the quarter we generated preprovision net revenue of million up million from the prior quarter net interest income increased million from fourth quarter driven by improvements in both deposit and loan pricing which expanded the margin by basis points fees excluding deferred comp were up million from last quarter driven by ph higher revenues from our fixed income business which saw a increase in adr expenses excluding deferred comp were down million linked quarter driven by a significant reduction to outside services which as previously mentioned were elevated in the fourth quarter that reduction was partially offset by personnel increases for annual merit seasonal benefits and revenue driven incentives within our fixed income business expenses remain a lever that we are able to pull to drive increased profitability we continue to identify and implement operational efficiencies across our bank that will help us offset the increase of our strategic investments to drive enhanced shareholder returns provision expense was million in this quarter resulting in a stable acl coverage ratio of our strong performance improved return on tangible common equity by basis points on slide we outline a couple of notable items in the quarter which reduced results by per share first quarter notable items include incremental expense of million for the fdic special assessment which stemmed from revised estimates the fdic provided in february we also had million of restructuring expenses associated with personnel initiatives as we remain focused on finding operational efficiencies we also noted an upcoming event in second quarter on april first horizon provided notice that it will redeem all outstanding shares of the series d preferred stock on may the series d shares were acquired during the iberia merger of equals and do not qualify for capital treatment as the first call date was in a fiveyear window the interest rate was set to convert from a fixed coupon to a threemonth sofr in may second quarter will include an approximately million noncash charge associated with retirement of this instrument first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 on slide you will see that margin expanded basis points from the prior quarter to improving nii by million first quarter benefited from a full quarter of repricing on the promotional deposits gathered in with interest bearing deposit costs declining basis points from prior quarter loan yields also expanded basis points from the benefit of wider spreads on new and renewing loans as well as the ability to redeploy lower yielding fixed rate cash flows the path for deposit cost over the rest of the year will depend on when the fed decides to cut rates as well as the level of competition we see in our markets meanwhile loan yields still have room to modestly expand as fixed cash flows continue to reprice as you can see on slide weve successfully maintained deposit balances while reducing our deposit cost period end deposits are flat quartertoquarter with a basis point reduction to the total deposit rate and a basis point reduction to the interest bearing rate paid we continue to see strong retention on the promotional deposits repriced last quarter with about retention on both the number of clients and the balances we had a modest increase in brokered balances as contracts initiated in funded up ahead of approximately million of brokered cds maturing in the second quarter though we continue to see some rotation out of noninterest bearing in january balances were relatively flat since february we have an overview of our diversified loan portfolio on slide period end loans were up from the prior quarter loans to mortgage companies are up or million at period end so average balances were down slightly due to typical seasonality in the business cre loans are up million driven by fundups primarily in multifamily we added some additional cre detail in the appendix this quarter including a geographical breakdown that illustrates the granularity and attractive footprint of the portfolio loan yields are up basis points continuing to benefit from wider spreads on new and renewing loans as well as continued repricing of fixed rate cash flows spreads on new loans increased basis points yearoveryear fixed rate cash flows should continue to be a tailwind as we have billion cash flows coming back over the next year with a roll off yield of approximately on slide you can see that our countercyclical businesses had a relatively strong quarter average daily revenue in our fixed income business increased from fourth quarter contributing an additional million of fee income the rebound this quarter was driven by improving liquidity conditions in the banking sector and the markets expectation that shortterm rates have peaked and were likely headed lower though the recent inflation numbers have reduced the prospect of rate cuts we expect business will remain solid though not as strong as first quarter levels mortgage revenue also increased by million primarily due to higher volumes service charges and fees decreased million due to seasonality and overdraft fees card and digital banking fees rebounded million as fourth quarter included a nonrecurring impact from accounting methodology adjustment on interchange rebates lastly our noninterest income declined million mostly due to lower fhlb dividends as well as a modest reduction in letter of credit and swap fees slide we show that excluding deferred compensation adjusted expenses are down million personnel excluding deferred comp was up million from last quarter with a couple of drivers first salaries and benefits are up million due to our annual merit increase which were effective january and seasonality in certain benefits lines such as 401k match and unemployment compensation second incentives and commissions increased million driven by incentives on the fixed income revenue growth offsetting these personnel increases is a significant decrease to outside services as a reminder our fourth quarter marketing expense was elevated for deposit and brand campaigns as well as thirdparty services engaged on our strategic investments as progresses we expect technology investment expenses to first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 moderately increase over the year but those costs will be offset by lower retention expenses and continuing to identify and implement operational efficiencies ill cover asset quality reserves on slide loan loss provision was million this quarter flat to prior quarter net chargeoffs were million or basis points our largest chargeoff this quarter was a million ci loan to a consumer goods company for which we were already fully reserved we also had million of partial chargedowns on three commercial real estate loans based on updated appraisal values the acl coverage ratio remained stable at weve provided additional detail in the appendix that gives some insight into the diversification and granularity of our loan portfolio we have remained disciplined in underwriting and our approach to client selection while we have seen some additional negative grade migration in the first quarter overall we continue to see stable credit performance across markets and industries on slide you can see that we have maintained strong capital levels while successfully deploying capital to shareholders through the repurchase of almost million shares utilizing approximately ph million of our million of share repurchase authority share repurchases drove a basis point reduction in capital this quarter while cet1 remains very strong at adjusting for the marks on our securities portfolio and loan book our pro forma cet1 ratio would be which is well above the regulatory threshold we will continue to opportunistically deploy capital above our nearterm target first quarter tangible book value per share increased to benefiting by of net income offset by of dividends from higher marktomarket impacts and of share buybacks on slide weve updated our outlook slightly to reflect better than expected performance in our countercyclical businesses we continue to expect our full year nii growth to fall within the to range that we originally outlined we have updated our assumptions for interest rates to reflect the forward curve for march which includes cuts in june september and november though the markets expectations have continued to evolve over the last few weeks we do not believe it will have a material impact to our outlook we saw strong performance from our countercyclical business in the first quarter with fixed income fees of million and mortgages up million from prior quarter we expect these businesses to continue to perform well which has improved our outlook for noninterest income growth from a range of previously to an updated to the expense outlook remains unchanged despite increases to revenuedriven incentives and our countercyclical businesses due to the benefit of the operational efficiencies we have implemented i will wrap up on slide which is a slide that you have all seen a few times now but it really drives home that we are focused on a company in order to maximize shareholder value first quarter was a great start to and i believe this is the beginning to a strong year for first horizon we expect to deliver better revenue performance that we laid out in our original guidance while finding operational efficiencies to maintain our expense guidance we are making tremendous progress on the strategic investments we have been talking about for almost a year now and these initiatives will allow us to offer our clients and associates better products better service and improved efficiency first horizon has a diversified business model that can provide top quartile results throughout any cycle we are wellpositioned to capitalize on our 160year legacy with our passionate and dedicated bankers clients and communities we will continue to demonstrate our commitment strength and resiliency while increasing shareholder returns now ill give it back to bryan first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 d bryan jordan chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you hope our first quarter results reflect the strength of our franchise and the ability to improve profitability in an extremely competitive industry as hope mentioned our teams have made great progress over the last year on our strategic investments which will allow our associates to serve our clients more quickly and efficiently i continue to remain confident that this company has the people the clients and the enthusiasm to build an unparalleled banking franchise in the south my expectation is that the next few months for the economy will look similar to the first quarter which gives me tremendous confidence in our ability to generate strong returns for our shareholders throughout the rest of the year finally i want to touch on the announcement we made monday that our chief credit officer susan springfield has decided to retire later this year we have named tom hung as her successor tom currently runs our franchise finance business and brings a wealth of credit and client experience to the role we have already started the transition process with tom serving as deputy chief credit officer as he prepares to officially step into the role on october susan will remain with the company until the end of the year to help ensure a seamless transition susans decision to retire is bittersweet and she will be greatly missed she has been with the company for nearly years having served as chief credit officer for of those years she led us adeptly through a number of credit cycles maintaining strong credit quality under her leadership she has been a vital member of our executive management committee as well as a mentor and role model to countless young professionals throughout her distinguished career were incredibly grateful for her steadfast leadership and her unwavering devotion to our team and our clients thank you susan karla we can now open it up for questions first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 question and answer section operator thank you bryan operator instructions our first question comes from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey bryan how are you i guess maybe just first question for hope around nii outlook in the past hope you provided spot rates on deposit costs just give us if you dont mind if you can drill down into what the spot rate was at the end of and how we should think about that drifting higher im assuming if we dont get much in terms of rate cuts for the rest of the year hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee thanks ebrahim good to hear from you this morning our spot rate at the end of the quarter was slightly up on interest bearing and total deposits on average kind of flat well some of it is mix some of its timing so i really want to focus on what was our overall deposit cost for the quarter our betas went from a peak of ph down to we continue to has momentum in retaining the balances and repricing them were probably at the bottom of being able to reprice those promotional deposits and we are seeing increased competition as you mentioned the longer it takes us to get that first rate cut the harder i think its going to be to continue to drive deposit costs down meaningfully we could be a couple of basis points here or there within a month or a spot rate within a quarter but i think were probably close to where the deposit costs will be for the rest of the year within maybe on the beta on either side it is really hard to predict the market is just changing so quick and competition will slow one month and then pick up the next week and so its going to be kind of a month by month look for the industry i think bryan do you want to add ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and then hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee anything to that first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc go ahead d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee no go ahead ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah no i guess just taking a step back when we look at that to nii guide is the delta going to be around what gets you to is it going to be just loan growth or whether or not we get any rate cuts whats more impactful hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah ebrahim if we get to the higher end of that guidance we would definitely have to see less rates cuts we have an asset sensitive balance sheet and so with less rate cuts puts us at the higher end more rate cuts put to the lower end the thing that i cant handicap right now within to on the full year is what are the deposit cost going to be for the rest of the year we had originally given guidance assuming we see a rate cut at some point early half the year and we start to see competition for deposit costs be going down as an industry and if we dont see any rate cut we dont see rate cuts until late in the year thats where it gets a little harder for me to predict but think about it as well be on the lower end with the current curve and less rate cuts is more positive for us to get to the higher end of that guidance d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee youll remember when we laid out that guidance in the fourth quarter we laid it out based on four rate cuts in and the over and under betting seems to be were going to the market as two today and there are questions about whether we get two or not so that would dictate it so deposit and loan pricing will both be affected by how many cuts we actually do get as hope pointed out the most important aspect of managing the margin is were not playing solitaire were doing this on a competitive marketplace and weve seen pricing competition increase fairly significantly and i think youre seeing that show up in some of the earnings releases that are out there and so well continue to protect our deposit base well continue to protect our customer base and well continue to compete on a long term basis of growing the franchise i would say were every bit as focused on managing both sides of the balance sheet you saw improvement on our loan spreads and youve seen improvement on deposit pricing and we think that will continue we just think its sort of stabilized at this point given whats going on competitively ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 thank you operator our next question comes from michael rose from raymond james michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions i think in the prepared remarks you mentioned that loan yields have the potential to move higher just as cash flows continue to mature can you just give us a sense for what the magnitude of that could be and bryan if you can just generally comment on loan demand in some of your markets at this point obviously i think some areas of commercial real estate a little bit weaker but you are seeing some fundups from existing commitments and just what youre seeing generally on the ci side thanks hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee thanks michael as i mentioned in my prepared comments we do have a fair amount of cash flow coming in that we will be able to redeploy from a loan growth perspective were forecasting kind of flat to maybe slightly up as we look at where to redeploy that mortgage warehouse is one of those that is a seasonal product for us and tends to fund up in  and  and its our highest yielding asset that we have where so when we look at kind of how will the year project you do need to look at the seasonality of that business we continue to see our renewing business and new business expanding margins anywhere from basis points spread all the way up to basis points and some above basis points in our top businesses and so when we think about our specialty businesses they have a higher spread when you think about regional businesses they are slightly on the lower end of that but feel confident that we will be able to even with slowing the loan demand that well be able to put this into our portfolio on the client side and be able to be there for our existing clients and bring new clients into the first horizon franchise with an expanding loan margin d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee michael ill pickup on loan demand loan demand is okay its not great it really is in pockets that you see real strength you have some aspects of the carolinas where loan demand has been very good and you see other pockets where is probably a bit softer as you mentioned we do have the benefit of some fundup on some existing relationships and you started to see the tick up in seasonality in our mortgage warehouse lending business and thats usually stronger in the second and third quarters of the year as the movein season kicks in but overall were still seeing good opportunities were still being very selective about how and where we participate particularly on price and structure but were looking for longterm growth and really those generational opportunities to move business but i expect that the loan demand is likely to remain somewhat more modest broadly speaking in the economy simply because were in that space between rates not going up anymore and rates not coming down and i think people are still a little bit cautious and its going to take a little bit more certainty about when the fed is going to move and i think people will start to lean in the economy is still very good in our view relative to all thats going on in the world and how much rates have been moving up and as you know we benefit from being in a sector of the us in the south that has a very strong general economic dynamic so we think that loan demand will be fairly soft but improve over the course of the year first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc thats great color and maybe just as my followup maybe one for susan and congratulations on your upcoming retirement well deserved can you just describe what drove kind of the increase in nonperformers and then if you have an update to the criticized balances at quarterend i think they were a little over billion at the end of the fourth quarter thanks susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee sure thanks and thanks michael for the nice comments as it relates to new nonperforming we saw non performing go up of about million and thats a just a few new nonperforming loans that increase was largely driven by two credits one was a senior living facility a senior living assisted living memory care facility and the other was a consumer finance company again so were seeing some slight movement in npls were still seeing it kind of not any specific industry or sector and as it relates to credit size we have had a continued focus on conservative grading and as we somewhat seasonal getting in yearend financials on borrowers we did see criticized balances go up about but most much of that was been on special mention its kind of a watch status so those are not defined weaknesses at this point theyre more a potential weaknesses where were just taking a more frequent look working with borrowers the other thing im really pleased to see and this is in commercial real estate as well as ci is borrower is really coming to the table wanting to work with us were wanting to work with them and weve seen good opportunities to bring in additional equity reserves et cetera as we have plans that may be temporarily challenged due to interest rate environments and then classified loans were up less than quarteroverquarter michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc perfect thanks for taking my questions appreciate it susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee thanks michael operator our next question comes from jon harfstrom from rbc jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thats close jon arfstrom good morning everyone d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee hey jon how are you first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc its like trying to pronounce hopes last name its just challenging just susan for you just to followup on michaels question anything new or surprising that youre seeing on credit and what do you think we should expect on nonperforming trends for can you just set the expectation there susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah i dont really seeing anything that surprises me again were still look each one kind of has its stories were talking borrower about borrower weve had a number of deepdives and portfolio reviews across lines of business in different regions great conversations with our bankers about whats going on our bankers are having great conversations with clients as i mentioned earlier to michaels question still really pleased to see how were able to be at the table talk about rightsizing a loan or what do we need to do what do you think is going to happen getting updated projections from clients so we still feel good about to have ultimate performance of the portfolio i think depending on what happens with interest rates jon thats probably going to affect it obviously if we start seeing rates start to go down i think youll see nonperforming loans start to slow in terms of any increases the good news about not having any increased rates right now though youre seeing a lot of borrowers who have adapted to this new interest rate environment whether its able to pass along costs in their businesses or just learning how to do things differently being more efficient learning how to operate in the higher interest rate environment so it just were still being cautious but i mentioned were always selective were disciplined in how we underwrite discipline in client selection and so thats serving us well but were keeping an eye on the portfolio d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee jon i would add to that im not really surprised at all by anything i see in terms of credit performance or youre getting what you would expect with higher inflation and higher interest rates and a lot of movement at a fairly short period of time and across the entire economy youre going to have borrowers who are a little more stressed by that is going to show up in terms of their performance i would say susan and her credit teams as well as our relationship teams our rms and pms have been very proactive and doing deep dives through portfolio understanding at a transaction level borrowers financial position as susan said being very proactive and working with borrowers and as susan also said weve had a tremendous success with borrowers who want to work with us and stepped up with rightsizing loans et cetera so im not surprised and in fact im very pleased with the performance that i see given the nature of whats going on in the underlying economy and the way weve structured this loan portfolio im very comfortable that were in a pretty good position jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good fair enough and then hope for you on slide the bottom of slide youre highlighting billion in loans and securities that are rolling off can you talk about what the repricing uplift is from that and i think the message here is that you expect the margin to grind higher because of some of this repricing the deposit first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 repricing opportunities are probably done so its more about this asset repricing thats going to drive the margin higher over time is that the right message hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee thats the right message jon and i think the deposits as i think could go a couple of basis points lower a couple of basis points higher and quartertoquarter they may change until we see that first rate cut but we have billion rolling off at yield and youre seeing and yields pretty steadily in the market and some in our specialty businesses and so absolutely putting that to work on the client side of the balance sheet versus parking it in securities or something else is our intention with that money to be able to increase our spread jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you very much d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator our next question comes from casey haire from jefferies casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thanks good morning everyone hope a question for you on the nii outlook the dda attrition a little bit lower as you guys kind of highlighted in january just wondering what does this guide presume for dda mix going forward hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah the guide is a basis point range there so it is assuming today were assuming kind of flat balances with noninterest bearing if we were to see a larger pickup in that again that could help us get to the higher end of the range but i dont see any risk to that taking us below the range if we saw immaterial runoff we think were at the bottom right we saw some january outflows february and march are really stabilized first quarter does tend to be a little bit more seasonally low and then come back through the year casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good and then just a big picture question on getting ready for the billion in cat iv when i compare you guys versus the cat iv group you guys are in pretty good shape if there is a weak link its on the liquidity side im just wondering when do you guys start to i know you have time but when do you start to address that and build out the securities book andor drive down that loan to deposit ratio d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah theres a lot of work going in all around the industry to understand the impact on potential category iv banks well as you know casey weve done a lot of work around it and i think we are in pretty good shape we first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 have continued to run stress testing we have some of the infrastructure in place not all and we will build that infrastructure out on the compliance side the balance sheet structure issues really fall into two major categories one youve highlighted which is liquidity the other is the potential for tlac and we dont have a lot of total loss absorbing capital or longterm debt on our balance sheet either and in some sense those two can be mutually solving in the sense that if we raise debt we can use that to fund how quality liquid assets so as you said we have time we dont feel any particular urgency to start moving the shape of the balance sheet today were mindful of those two balance sheet hurdles that we would have to get over and as we get greater clarity from the basel iii endgame the fdics proposals around tlac well have a better sense of the steps that we need to take over the next two or three years to get prepared for crossing that threshold casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thank you just last question for susan you mentioned or hope mentioned a handful of losses within the cre bucket on updated appraisals just wondering if you could provide some color as to what the price decline was on those underlying properties susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah i mean on the specific ones id say on average we saw probably about a decline i did get in close contact with our chief appraiser just on a larger perspective casey just on what were seeing in terms of reappraisals both on nonperforming properties but also just office in general and it really varies a good bit by market strong markets like in florida youre seeing ph small turns of to to not and then some markets or certain office properties that may have had a major tenant that they havent yet replaced you can see it in the range so it is kind of on an individual basis as it relates to the credits where we took a partial charge related to the new updated appraisals this quarter it was in three different markets and one was actually a more of a mixed use facility just that office had less space and so we classify that as office all three were in our footprint casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay and that so theyre it sounds like most were office one was a mixed use or was are these varied by underlying property type susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee of the million that we took in and chargeoffs and commercial real estate two were pure office and then one was a mixed use that had some office space which was the predominant space but it also had been retail and multifamily casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you thank you first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thanks casey operator our next question comes from jared shaw from barclays jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc you know maybe sticking with caseys question on the cre what drove the revaluation is that because you saw individual credit migration or is this part of a broader reevaluation of all cre and i guess if its not broader what happens to drive a reevaluation susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah there are a number of things jared that first of all whenever we downgrade loans to nonpath we have a policy where we do updated appraisals on commercial real estate loans that get downgraded to nonpath within several months of a downgrade and then as we if we start to see further deterioration in this case these were nonperforming loans then well in all these three cases these were we reappraised six months later just having to look at what may be going on the other thing that can trigger it is if theres something in an individual loan it could be the loss of a tenant that was maybe it was being renegotiated thought it was going to come up or maybe its renegotiated a lower rate that could cause the need for an appraisal so we believe in being conservative and if we need to reappraise like in this case within six months of the last one then well do that to make sure weve got the valuations correct jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay so those three loans you talked about they were previously nonperformers and they hit the six month ph seeded an additional reappraisal i guess what happened with that first reappraisal so if these are down call it what was that first reappraisal step down from maybe peak to current susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee so on that on one of them i mean jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 well i guess on those three loans that were previously nonperformer i guess what you talked about a mark down now from what im assuming is the six month prior reappraisal susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc whats the magnitude of sort of origination to current markdown susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee right so in terms of i have to look back at that but again on average what were seeing and i hate to do averages because it really does vary by property so in one case it was down to from an original appraisal but then our charge was not nearly that much because weve got significant equities that weve gotten these properties when we underwrite them in other cases were seeing appraisals changes of so its theres a different number for each building jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay all right thats good color thanks and then maybe shifting to the fixed income business really good trends in adrs this quarter i guess in a stable rate environment whats driving the expectation for lower adrs going forward was that just you saw some maybe a spurt of activity early on and then it tapered off or how should we be thinking about the pace of that for the rest of the year susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah jared ill start that yes the first is there was a pent up demand right there had not been a lot of balance sheet repositioning there had not been a lot of liquidity put to use that we started to see it happen in december and we had a really good december which we talked about in our last earnings call and that just carried through to  and so we think some of that is behind us and it was more of just kind of a catch up additionally the current week has had given us a little bit of pause in that we are talking about not if well see rate cut but could we see a rate increase this year what will it look like and that has stall well will stall that business for a period of time and if do you run the current guidance i know you all do after this call it assumes kind of a 500000ish adr for the rest of the year which is still significantly stronger than we saw last year in every quarter except for  jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay okay thanks and then finally just for me on the buyback strong activity this quarter should we be thinking that you continue being pretty aggressive on that million authorization or was there anything unique in first quarter that may have accelerated some of that first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee no well continue to be very opportunistic but we still believe that the stock is and has been on sale and well look for opportunities to manage our excess capital relative that nearterm target and the buyback is a great vehicle for doing that in the absence of a significant pick up and balance sheet growth ie loan growth jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc great thanks a lot d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee sure thanks thank you jared operator our next question comes from chris mcgratty from kbw christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh great thanks good morning just wanted to followup on jareds question on the buyback bryan you mentioned the as the near term i guess what would lead you to change that directionally either up or down and maybe is there something you could consider this year d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee well right now i dont think about change in near term i think theres still enough uncertainty and the economy and the interest rate environment that we want to see a few more cards if anything changed it would have to be a significant pickup in the economic environment and inflation abating significantly and i dont anticipate either one of those at this point so well manage to the nearterm well have greater clarity probably by the end of this year about what basel iii is likely the basel iii endgame is likely to look like and we can manage from there so were comfortable with that target and as we pointed out earlier we start with a ratio in cet1 and so we have a little bit of gap there and were going to have some earnings so we think weve got the capacity with the authorization that we can make a significant dent in that authorization over the next three quarters christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and just maybe one more on the fee income business a lot of talk about the fixed income the mortgage banking is a smaller line item but directionally had a decent jump linked quarter maybe whats in your assumptions in your guide hope for the mortgage just the gain on sale business hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 yeah its not materially up from here  was coming off a pretty you know record low last year for mortgage originations and  was somewhat anemic in that space and so were not expecting a big upturn but just the continued originations coming in christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you operator our next question comes from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee hi steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc bryan i wanted to go back to your answer to caseys question in crossing billion and im curious given how this new york community situation played out how has that impacted how you think about crossing this threshold previously you said that you thought the transaction was a preferred method curious if you still feel that way d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee say the last part again as you broke up a little bit i still feel what way about what steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc well in the past yeah in the past you indicated that you didnt want to roll over billion you wanted to more of a d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc leap over it via transaction im just curious if you still feel that way just seeing how your community played out d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 well yeah thats a yeah i guess you have to couple a couple thoughts one is if you put ma in a separate bucket i still have significant reservations about one what can get approved and two how long it takes to get it approved and so thats not something without greater clarity that looks like a good idea independently and then you couple it with crossing the billion threshold and in particular how much readiness do you have to have is there really a threeyear phase in if you cross in the context of an ma transaction i would tell you while i dont have any inside information my gut would tell me that what happened recently is likely to make it more difficult to cross and i think youll have to show a significant great a significantly greater degree of preparedness to be a category iv bank or a very nearterm path for achieving that so i think it makes it and said another way it makes it more likely that if you cross the billion threshold in the near term its likely to be in an organic fashion and then you sort of deal with is ma the right strategy and does it make sense from a shareholder and a capital deployment perspective independent of trying to cross that threshold steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful that makes sense if i could shift gears and talk about ci loan growth when i look at balances theyre pretty flat versus prior quarter up a bit versus last year its funny when i look at your markets whether its whats going on in nashville or texas or florida theyre on fire gdp is probably in your markets why are you not seeing stronger commercial loan growth here susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee okay ill take part of that steven in terms of ci loan growth first of all we have been focused on making sure that were taking care of existing clients first were also very focused on full relationship businesses and as bryan said earlier we continue to remain selective in terms of new underwriting and bringing on new clients that being said we are open for business and we are seeing some good opportunities and have brought in both new to bank as well as some increased opportunities with existing clients and we are hearing when we have pipeline calls we are hearing some additional opportunities for us to again lend existing customers but also bring in some generational opportunities in our communities as well as in our specialty lines of business so i think that you will continue to see some opportunities for loan growth across our markets and our business line d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee as i pointed out earlier steven there are pockets that are stronger than others and some that are a little softer and susan is exactly right if you step back we are looking to build relationships and do relationship banking and we really want to move in bank relationships doing the transaction lending money getting it out the door is the easy part of the business its really how you build relationships and the longterm nature of the banking business and i think our teams are doing an outstanding job of working for relationship and weve taken some opportunities where there is not the opportunity for a long term relationship to step away from some transaction so were trying to manage our balance sheet in a way that manages the balance between profitability and growth steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 okay thats fair and maybe susan if i could squeeze one more in for you on commercial real estate i see the maturity schedule here on the slide can you tell us what was the balance of commercial real estate loans that can you do here in the first quarter and how did those work out in terms of refinance extensions things like that thanks susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee well in terms of things that came up through weve had in terms of things have come up we have been again as i said earlier weve had good really good outcomes in terms of working with borrowers on the appropriate way to refinance when there is a maturity it could be the things are clicking along like they should then we look at just kind of a traditional renewal looking at rates and structure sometimes we do talk with borrowers about bringing money to the table either as in terms of a pay down or some reserves so again were having i think really good success one of the things that i do want to emphasize is that we can and i mentioned this earlier weve been very disciplined in our underwriting really through all the cycles and if you look at things like our office portfolio and this is with updated appraisals and our stabilized loan to value on office is about so theres a lot of cushion that we have in our commercial real estate book of business and that allows us one to continue to have good outcomes but also the ability to work with borrowers i mean borrowers have that kind of equity in front of our debt theres even more of an incentive to work with us the last thing i would add is that weve also seen in certain cases where we have been able to as bryan talked about exiting things that arent relationships but i would tell you im also still will occasionally see us get refinanced out of something that might not hurt our feelings that were being refinanced out of either because of a credit grade or potentially a borrower that didnt come to the table with quite the right approach that worked for us so its good to see that there are still some opportunities out there too when it doesnt fit our risk profile going forward that there are opportunities for them to refinance so all in all i feel good about things that have come up for maturity our ability to work with them and the options that we have steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for the color and susan congratulations on the upcoming retirement susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you i really appreciate it operator our next question comes from timur braziler from wells fargo timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc one more for you susan on commercial real estate just looking at the allowance build over the last couple of quarters compared to the coverage ratio on the cre book the coverage ratio looks like its today thats been tracking lower i guess how should we be thinking about the coverage ratio here and if we dont get any kind of improvement in rates and we see some broader kind of degradation in that space are you modeling it to a coverage ratio or are you modeling it to an allowance ratio and maybe just give us the puts and takes of those two susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee yes as it relates to the allowance process i would tell you that we dont really we dont shoot for a specific number we go through a process a disciplined process each and every quarter and look at various scenarios such as different economic outlooks things that are base case things that are ultrastress cases we dont put a lot of emphasis on upside cases but there are those out there as well and then we have qualitative overlays related to certain segments that we may decide needs either that may need more than what just an economic outlook would look like as you know with cecl cecl is considered a lifetime loss approach so based on what we know today and whats external economists and our own internal experts are saying we believe this is the right reserve coverage based on several different outcomes that could emerge but as i mentioned earlier each quarter were re evaluating that and as we all know things like interest rate outlooks can change pretty dramatically quarterto quarter all that being said i do think the economy bryan talked about this i think the economy remains strong were still seeing borrowers being able to adapt to higher inflation higher interest rates but this is something that we take a look at each and every quarter timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks and then my followup looking at slide on the ci loan buckets the of ci thats to finance and insurance companies can you just give us a reminder what that composition is and maybe more specifically what component of that balance is to borrowers that are then using those funds as leverage for commercial loans susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah so the finance and insurance bucket has a number of different things in it probably one of the things our assetbased lending business we lend to companies that lend to others a good part of that is consumer finance company and weve been in that business for many many years and weve got very sophisticated borrowers i would tell you just as a sidebar weve also seen them adapt nicely to our interest rate environment as it relates to how they deploy i dont have the exact number with me on how much of it is to then further commercial funds its not a big number for us we do have some of that kind of business to business type lending arrangement but its not a significant portion of that finance and insurance bucket so those are the ones i would highlight in that bucket first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks thank you for the question d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thank you operator our next question comes from ben gerlinger from citi benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks good morning everyone d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning ben susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc i just so i was curious i know belabored quite a bit here on the guidance change it seems like the uptick in fees one its the big positive so i think going from to now to should we kind of assume the expenses are closer to that range given youve cited fee and fixed income and mortgage which are typically higher efficiency ratio businesses or can you also see fees at the higher end and expenses on lower just kind of thinking about the cadence of the two throughout the year hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee ben thanks for the question i would not say that the expenses will be on the high end thats a foregone conclusion as we mentioned we are continuing to look at operational efficiencies we are looking at what is the right way to run the organization in a lower loan growth environment we have spent a significant amount on technology thats going to go into ph place this year increase additional efficiency were looking at every contract thats coming up and looking at what were doing on board and so our goal would not to be on the end of that but things can change but no i would not make that assumption if i thought we were in the high end of that honestly i thought it would just increase guidance at the same time i told you to be increased revenue and derisk it benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 got you okay thats fair and it kind of leads to my next question actually because i know youre asset sensitive you took out a cut in your guidance to me it kind of implies that youre closer to the higher end like if we get to the middle of the year would it even be worth going from plus to to something like to or is that too nuanced to think about hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee ben i wish i could if you saw the number of models we run every single month and as soon as we get to alco every month somebody has said something how overtly something theres new cpi data which puts it out and so i just dont think were in an environment where we could be that specific and we thought it was going to be kind of like our fee income we knew that the high end of the guidance is probably the low side and we immediately let you guys know that we dont expect to come in because there we expect to be it on the high side and then we said previous high side or low side forecasting nii in this environment is very very hard even within a range with as much moving parts as we have benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you okay appreciate it indiscernible i run a one model indiscernible similar number so appreciate the heavy lifting you guys are doing on your end d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee thanks ben operator our next question comes from christopher marinac from janney montgomery scott christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks good morning susan i wanted to ask you about loan modifications how often are you seeing the indiscernible susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee chris you broke up the last part of that question can you repeat it chris are you there and karla lets move on to the next question christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc susan the susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon

next question and chris can hop back in queue if he needs to operator all right our next question comes from brennan crowley from baird brennan crowley q analyst robert w baird co inc hey good morning guys thanks for taking my question given fees guide and i know one point last year kind of positive operating numbers were discussed and i mean kind of walk back a bit and i know its difficult with the investment initiative underway here but given what youve seen through ph the three months and the working guide today is that going to be a possibility for this year hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee thanks for the question brennan i think if you look at where the guide is it is neutral on operating leverage or slightly positive depending on which side of the range we come in d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee so in short the answer is yes its possible brennan crowley q analyst robert w baird co inc okay great thanks yeah all right great thanks thank you guys and then just as a quick followup and maybe i missed this in the prepared remarks but saw that the investment portfolio yield actually fell sequentially just kind of wondering if you could talk about the driver there and then maybe how you guys plan to manage the portfolio and rolloff over the next couple of quarters d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah first ill mentioned were currently not reinvesting in our securities portfolio so were letting it runoff and redeploying that into the loan side of our balance sheet but a lot of the volatility that you saw this quarter is just the marktomarket and where the market is at the end of the quarter there was nothing that material change in our balance sheet brennan crowley q analyst robert w baird co inc okay great thanks guys operator our next question comes from samuel varga from ubs first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee good morning samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc i just wanted to ask one last followup on nii i appreciate you touched on the billion of the fixed rate loan repricing could you give some color on how even that is through is it similar to security where its pretty much the same every quarter or is it a bit more front or back loaded hope dmuchowski a senior executive vice president chief financial officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah its pretty consistent through the quarter theres not a bulge quarter or it being backloaded samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc okay great i appreciate it thanks for taking my question operator and our next question comes from christopher marinac from montgomery scott christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks sorry for my issue there earlier susan i wanted to ask you about loan modifications and how often they are a tactic for resolving any type of loan this year and next susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee well i mean any time we have either what if theres a true maturity were always looking at what do we need to do that thats really kind of a true modification in terms of modifications and we have ones that are nonpast that are handled in our special assets groups there are situations where it might be in our best interest if were the lead bank or the indiscernible bank to work with them on modifications and then obviously on some of the deals where were part of a bank group and the bank group has to work together on what could be an appropriate loan modifications i would tell you chris that we have a history of wanting to work with borrowers and figure out the best outcomes that obviously for us are the best outcomes for our shareholders but weve also are complimented frequently by our borrowers about our ability to work with them and in some cases keep them in business first horizon corp tennessee fhn corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 and as i mentioned earlier in many cases theyve got a lot of equity ahead of us and so they have a vested interest in working with us for to come up with something that makes sense and is economically viable for both the bank and the client d bryan jordan a chairman president chief executive officer first horizon corp tennessee the loan modifications used to be an accounting term of ours and ill echo what susan said i often say this and i dont say it lightly to our clients and we look at it as a partnership and so we use that long term relationship and we work through the ups and downs and i dont consider that modification i just consider that supporting the long term relationships that really drive out the profitability of our organization and our balance sheet at the same time makes our customers and our community stronger christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc no thats great thank you both for your color on that and susan just a quick followup on debt service coverage ratios how is the stress process going for customers are you seeing instances where you have to criticize a loan due to just higher interest rates and the dscr is falling susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee yeah chris i would say thats actually the predominant reason that were taking loans to special mention and the initial criticized status would be that debt service coverage while still over still able to service the loan it might be its less than either a covenant or where the borrower expected to be at a certain point in time and we do expect and i mentioned earlier that the downgrades mostly had been into that special mention category thats a very dynamic category and we do see borrowers come back out of it as they adjust either their operating expenses or its interest rate do start coming down i expect youll see a good bit of a lot of upgrades at that point christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you again and best wishes for your success susan susan l springfield a senior executive vice president chief credit officer first horizon corp tennessee thanks chris
