scott blackley chief financial officer capital one financial corp thanks jeff and good afternoon everyone ill start on slide of todays presentation where you can see capital one earned billion or per diluted common share in the third quarter included in eps for the quarter were three adjusting items which are outlined on the slide net of these adjusting items earnings per share in the quarter was per share in addition to the adjusting items we had a couple of notable items in the quarter we recorded a gain of million or per share related to an equity stake in snowflake which recently priced its initial public offering we also recorded a million or per share allowance release associated with moving a partnership card portfolio to heldforsale turning to slide i will cover the quarterly allowance moves in more detail excluding the heldforsale transfer we released million of allowance for the total company in the third quarter mostly driven by a smaller balance sheet in our allowance we continue to assume no benefits from further government stimulus beyond any residual impacts of prior legislation and a correspondingly severe economic outlook with targeted qualitative factors for specific areas of uncertainty we assume we end this year at a unemployment rate improving to around by the end of turning to slide you can see that allowance coverage levels were essentially flat as allowance releases were commensurate with contractions in our card and commercial loan portfolios our consumer banking coverage ratio declined modestly to from mostly driven by a release in our auto finance allowance which was driven by updated auction price assumptions moving to slide ill discuss our liquidity position you can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was up from at the end of the second quarter and well above the regulatory requirement our liquidity reserves from cash securities and federal home loan bank capacity is largely flat to last quarter at billion including about billion in cash driven by continued inflows of consumer deposits turning to slide you can see that our net interest margin declined basis point quarteroverquarter this decline was driven by higher average cash in the quarter the effects of investment securities and lower average card balances capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 in the quarter we purchased securities to manage down a portion of our excess cash balance resulting in a quarteroverquarter decline in ending cash of approximately billion given the low rate environment we also saw our premium amortization expense increase due to increased prepayments on our mortgagebacked securities driving a 5basispoint net interest margin decline relative to last quarter looking forward our net interest margin will depend on how the impacts of this downturn in any future stimulus play out across our balance sheet including asset mix deposit balances and pricing and our cash position lastly turning to slide i will cover our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio was at the end of the third quarter up basis points from the second quarter we expect to maintain our dividend for the quarter our decision is mainly driven by the fact that we are in the midst of our ccar resubmission we continue to accrete capital and we expect to reassess our common stock dividend after we receive the feds feedback on our ccar resubmission we recognize the capital distribution both dividends and share repurchases is an important component of shareholder return turning to preferred stock issuances in the quarter we issued a new series of preferred stock as we expect to redeem our outstanding preferred stock series f in the fourth quarter this redemption will result in a onetime charge that will reduce net income available to common shareholders by approximately million in the fourth quarter of following the redemption of series f beginning in  of next year we expect quarterly preferred dividends to be about million barring any future issuances or other redemption activity with that ill turn the call over to rich rich richard d fairbank chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks scott ill begin on slide which summarizes results for our credit card business yearoveryear credit card loan balances purchase volume and revenue declined in the third quarter driven by the impacts of the pandemic the biggest driver of quarterly results was the provision for credit losses which improved significantly compared to both the prior year and linked quarters credit card segment results are a function of our domestic card results and trends which are shown on slide consumer behavior was a key driver of domestic card results in the third quarter in the current environment consumers continue to behave cautiously spending less saving more and paying down debt these behaviors are amplified by the cumulative effects of stimulus and widespread forbearance across the banking industry were seeing the effects of cautious consumer behavior across several key businesses results including pressure on spending and higher payments rates resulting in declining loan balances but this cautious behavior is also a key driver of the most impactful domestic card headline in the quarter strikingly strong credit results we posted exceptional credit performance in the third quarter especially in the context of the pandemic the chargeoff rate for the quarter was a 48basispoint improvement yearoveryear and an 89basispoint improvement from the sequential quarter the 30plus delinquency rate at quarter end was basis points better than the prior year the linked quarter improvement in the delinquency rate was basis points even though the typical seasonal pattern is a 40basispoint increase capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 in addition to positive impacts from cautious consumers stimulus and widespread forbearance our credit performance is benefiting from resilience choices we made before the downturn began including our avoidance of high balance revolvers and caution on credit lines our own domestic card forbearance is not a significant driver of credit performance because enrollment is low we provided updated information on domestic card forbearance on appendix slide purchase volume is rebounding from the sharp declines early in the pandemic third quarter purchase volume was down just from the prioryear quarter that compares to a yearoveryear decline of about in the second quarter and about in the first weeks of the pandemic by late september and through the first half of october yearoveryear purchase volume growth was modestly positive despite the rebound purchase volume growth is still down compared to the doubledigit growth we were seeing before the pandemic in the third quarter domestic card ending loan balances shrank by billion or yearoveryear average loans declined yearoveryear on a linkedquarter basis both ending and average loans were down cautious consumer behavior drove the declines our choices to tighten underwriting and pull back on marketing early in the pandemic were also a factor ending loan balances include the impact of two notable factors we moved billion of partnership loans to heldforsale in the quarter as scott mentioned which adds to both yearoveryear and linkedquarter declines and of course we added the walmart portfolio last year which offsets the yearoveryear decline but has no impact on the linked quarter excluding both the move to heldforsale and the walmart portfolio acquisition third quarter ending loans declined about from the prior year quarter and about from the linked quarter third quarter revenue decreased yearoveryear in line with average loans the revenue margin was up basis points from the third quarter of to noninterest expense was down million or from the third quarter of last year largely driven by our choice to pull back on marketing when the pandemic hit while total company marketing in the third quarter was essentially flat compared to the second quarter domestic card marketing increased from unusually low levels with most of the increase weighted toward the end of the quarter looking ahead we expect a significant sequential increase in total company marketing in the fourth quarter powered by the normal  to  seasonal ramp plus the full quarter effect of the increases in domestic card as always actual marketing in the fourth quarter and longer term will depend on our realtime assessment of opportunities for resilient growth in the competitive marketplace third quarter provision for credit losses improved by million yearoveryear driven by the allowance benefit of moving the partnership portfolio to heldforsale and the volumedriven allowance release that scott discussed slide summarizes third quarter results for our consumer banking business driven by our auto business ending loans increased yearoveryear average loans also grew when the covid downturn began we tightened our underwriting box in auto to focus on the most resilient assets we believe several factors are driving the growth were seeing even in the context of our tightening capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 the auto market rebound thus far has been stronger for larger franchise dealers the part of the market where we are focused some of the recent growth is likely driven by pentup demand from the early days of the shutdown and our digital products and services are driving growth in directtoconsumer originations and growth with dealers who want to provide a lowtouch car buying experience in response to social distancing our dealer relationship strategy and the digital infrastructure and capabilities we built from the bottomup put us in a strong position to grow highquality auto loans even with tighter underwriting third quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up billion or yearoveryear driven by the stimulusdriven surge in deposits in the second quarter average deposit interest rate decreased basis points as we reduced deposit pricing in response to the market interest rate environment and competitive dynamics over the course of the second and third quarters consumer banking revenue increased from the third quarter of last year revenue growth from higher auto loans and retail deposits was partially offset by differences in the timing of federal reserve rate cuts preceding our deposit pricing moves noninterest expense in consumer banking was up third quarter provision for credit losses improved by million yearoveryear driven by lower chargeoffs and a modest allowance release in our auto business our auto business posted unusually strong credit results in the third quarter the chargeoff rate improved basis points compared to the prioryear quarter to the delinquency rate improved basis points yearoveryear to in addition to the same general drivers of domestic card credit strength auto credit benefited from very strong auction values and in contrast to domestic card our own covid auto forbearance is having a significant positive impact because weve extended relief to customers in later stages of delinquency and enrollment is much higher we provided an updated auto forbearance information chart on appendix slide moving to slide ill discuss our commercial banking business third quarter ending loan balances were up yearoveryear driven by growth in selected ci and cre specialties average loans were up average deposits increased about from the third quarter of as middle market customers continued to bolster their liquidity third quarter revenue was up from the prioryear quarter revenue growth from higher loan and deposit volumes higher noninterest income and lower deposit rate paid was partially offset by lower loan yields non interest expense increased by provision for credit losses improved by million compared to the third quarter of largely driven by the allowance release that scott discussed the commercial banking annualized chargeoff rate for the quarter was the criticized performing loan rate for the quarter increased compared to both the prior year and linked quarters to driven by downgrades in multifamily cre the criticized nonperforming loan rate rose modestly to our oil and gas exposure declined yearoveryear weve provided a breakout of our oil and gas portfolio composition and reserves on appendix slide ill close tonight with some thoughts on our results in the quarter and our positioning for the future capital one posted strong third quarter results yearoveryear revenue growth and lower noninterest expenses drove pre provision earnings up and provision for credit losses improved by more than billion as credit results across our card and auto businesses remained strikingly strong capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 pulling way up we continue to be well served by the choices we made before the pandemic since our founding days weve hardwired resilience into the choices weve made on credit capital and liquidity through good times and bad as a result we entered the downturn with strong and resilient credit trends a fortified balance sheet and deep experience and successfully navigating through prior periods of stress including the great recession and our investments to transform our technology and how we work and our efforts to drive the company to digital are powering our response to the downturn and positioning us for the acceleration of digital change and adoption driven by the pandemic as we continue to lean into resilience to manage through the nearterm challenges we also continue to focus on the things that create longterm value when delivered and sustained over time profitable resilient growth effective investments to transform technology positive operating leverage and capital distribution and now well be happy to answer your questions jeff jeff norris senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp thank you rich well now start the qa session as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single followup and if you have any followup questions after the qa session has ended the investor relations team will be available after the call keith please start the qa question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well take our first question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks i guess i have a question on the net interest margin trajectory going forward scott i know you talked about some contributors that caused the sequential degradation and the dependency for some items in the future but looking ahead if we assume a stable macro could you maybe just dimensionalize some of the upside levers you have i know theres a stepup in the walmart share you have the funding costs coming through the lower funding costs and then lower liquidity potentially could you just talk about those scott richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp sure hi good afternoon sanjay so look with respect to nim i think that the current margin is towards the low end of where i would expect to see nim given our balance sheet mix and if i just look at kind of the factors right now cash is elevated but deposit growth has slowed in  in  were going to get the full quarter benefit of the deposit pricing actions that we took in  and then auto growth is positive to nim so i look at just those factors and those are all positives capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 when you talk about longer term more stimulus is the potential there is that that might drive more savings which would be a headwind to nim if we received more cash in the form of deposits but on the other hand thats going to be a positive to our credit performance and that seems like a good trade to make so overall at this point feeling like were towards the lows on nim and there are a number of factors that would go in a positive direction if everything and the economy kind of went would stable from here forward sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and i guess talking about the economy your reserve rates were stable if not sort of declined a tad could you just talk about how you see that unfolding assuming things dont change materially in the macro situation and maybe rich you could chime in on some of the things that youre worried about or not on the macro side because you mentioned credit quality looks strikingly strong thanks richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp why dont i start on the allowance and then rich you can jump on the back end of that question so when i look at the allowance theres a couple important considerations one is that we build our allowance to exclude the potentially positive effects of stimulus beyond whats already in place and weve assumed some further worsening in the economy second our delinquency inventories are at really really low level so were starting at a place where its going to take a while for losses to actually manifest so i feel really comfortable with our coverage levels where they are today and if we just look at going forward more stimulus could be a significant positive factor to allowance and the economy is another wild card if it worsens beyond our current assumptions and we didnt get stimulus in that case in that case we might be looking at the potential for reserve additions but in an economy that goes kind of sideways or doesnt worsen much or if we get stimulus i think theres some upside in the allowance richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp sanjay just a comment about the consumer its this is the biggest disconnect that i certainly have experienced in my three decades of building capital one between what we see in the economy itself and the actual performance of the consumer especially from a credit point of view now some things i think always happen in a downturn and that is consumers tend to get more conservative so they tend to pull back spend less save more so in some ways why would what we see here be any different from the past and look i still put a high degree of uncertainty around things so im going to give you some views but dont use this as like a prediction of what the consumer is going to do in the rest of this downturn but i do think the consumer being in better shape going into this crisis starts kind of on the plus ledger for the consumer debt levels were lower payment obligations lower still supported by the low interest rates the savings rate over the past few years was i think around double what it was before the great recession and so the consumer entered in a stronger situation then what happened is unlike most other downturns and certainly unlike the great recession which took a lot of months to sort of build its momentum this thing kind of came all of a sudden and the world went into a free fall sort of as i often say we all went down the elevator together at the same time consumers did companies did and the government did capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 and so that i think the reaction by the consumers was more striking and more conservative than has happened in the past so theyre spending less saving more paying down debt and i think its amplified relative to the past then overlay on top of this of course that the swift and unprecedented government stimulus and the widespread forbearance programs across the banking industry were both much greater and much swifter than occurred in the past and so the cumulative impact to consumer balance sheets of lower wages offsetting government support and lower spending is the some of these effects by their conservatism and some of the benefits that they were granted by external parties has added up to a positive net consumer sort of savings effect of over trillion or about per household and obviously the impact across individual consumers and households is highly variable but we now have the expiration of the expanded unemployment benefit thats a blow to many millions of employed of unemployed americans i think what were dealing with is a cumulation of benefits that the consumer has had during this downturn such that when suddenly the stimulus was kind of shut off we didnt see our credit metrics suddenly skyrocket to worse places i think the consumer is working through some of that cumulative that has built up but i think that we still have to look at were talking about electrifying economic numbers awful lot of job losses now a lot more of them being more permanent and the government stimulus at this point not having been renewed so i think its just a matter of time before this thing could reverse itself in a significant way and you see everything i say i just want to say relative to a metaphor ive been using when i talk to investors is every month that there are favorable credit trends were sort of burrowing a longer tunnel underneath the huge economic worsening mountain such that even as potentially things revert to significantly worse place for the consumer i think weve reduced the cumulative losses through the downturn rather than just delaying the impact so those are some thoughts sanjay on what were seeing its certainly not something collectively that ive observed before but and no one should look at this and feel ill speak for myself we certainly we feel really good about the performance were seeing but we feel quite cautious about what could happen jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good evening richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hi betsy richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp hey betsy capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi i wanted to dig in a little bit on the auto results i know that you mentioned you have very strong auto results both on the loan side as well as on the credit side first question here is just around the used car prices theyre clearly up a lot at about yearonyear and i guess just wanted to understand how much that piece of the equation impacted your net chargeoffs and your nim around auto and what youre assuming for used car prices going forward from here richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay betsy theres been unprecedented volatility in auction prices since the start of the pandemic at the start of the pandemic we saw a sudden collapse in auction prices as stayathome orders basically froze markets and auction houses rushed to move online by the end of the second quarter we saw auction prices rebound to precovid levels and as the stayathome orders were lifted consumer demand experienced sort of a vshaped recovery in the auto space and supply remained constrained by lease delays and the decision of most lenders to suspend repossession at the start of the third quarter there was a massive amount of uncertainty around the stability of these trends particularly whether consumer demand would remain strong with the expiration of stimulus and whether it would be enough to offset projected increases in supply as its turned out through the third quarter consumer demand remained incredibly strong resulting in supply constraints that drove up auction prices as dealers struggled to maintain inventory levels over the last couple of weeks weve seen the industry start to work through these supply constraints with auction prices declining slightly and dealer inventory starting to recover towards the precovid levels so going forward we would expect auction prices to normalize over the next several months as the industry fully works through these supply issues were underwriting to an assumption that theyre going to be significantly adverse from there just because of the just to be cautious and because of the extreme volatility to your question about how important was this in the results it was one of the factors so for example in the credit results there really were three auto so why was auto credit so good beyond what were seeing in card that weve talked about there are three autospecific effects one is our covid loan extension programs having a more meaningful impact on our credit metrics than it is in card because the programs got more a bigger proportion of customers in it and because we extended relief to the impacted customers in later stage of delinquency and then weve got the used car auction prices which basically reached alltime highs in  and weve also seen somewhat higher auto recoveries from the catchup from our temporary suspension of repossessions earlier in the downturn so its definitely sort of a bunch of planets aligning in the auto space driving performance that is extraordinary and in some sense certainly on the credit side much of the things i talked about are more temporary in nature betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 got it okay no thats super helpful thanks for all that color rich the followup question i have just has to do with what youre seeing with regard to the accounts that are exiting forbearance in the various product sets that you have some other folks this earnings cycle have been suggesting that accounts exiting forbearance are exiting with a higher rate of delinquencies im wondering if you are seeing the same thing and if you could put a number on what that difference is between accounts that were in forbearance and arent thanks richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah so by the way i would put a lets say you told me a downturn of any kind was coming and we installed the forbearance program i would with confidence say customers who enter a forbearance program and exited will have higher delinquencies than those who never did only because you take a population and you now create a filter and this is an important filter did you raise your hand and say id like some of that forbearance its versus one minus that group it would be extremely rare for that group not to have higher delinquencies interestingly probably the biggest driver of the delinquency number is its like what or what percentage of them are when they leave and they stay current but probably the biggest driver of that is how wide the funnel was in the first place by which the company was inviting customers to come in and take the forbearance the wider the funnel the more likely regular very lowrisk customers sort of took advantage of the program so in our business let me just look this up here if we look at the customers in our card business we look at the customers who no longer enroll who are no longer enrolled but were previously of them are current in auto it is and the other thing again i just want to say im not sure how much information content there is in that only because one has filtered a population the most telling thing would be the overall delinquencies that you see on our portfolio because all these customers who have entered forbearance are basically part of the delinquency metrics that you observed jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from ryan nash with goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good evening guys richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hi there richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp hey ryan capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc rich you noted that we could see a significant ramp in marketing in can you maybe just clarify what the expectations are in terms of the quarteroverquarter increase and second just more broadly speaking when competition has historically pulled back youve used it as an opportunity when youve seen a window to accelerate growth and i was just wondering if you could just talk about your approach to increasing marketing spend at this point and are things still too uncertain for you to do that do you have any sort of visibility at this point or is it more just seasonal in nature and we should expect it to remain low as another issuer talked about this morning thanks richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah so look this our saying that marketing could be higher in the fourth quarter than the third is not a declaration that we see all the light at the end of the tunnel were all in youre right at capital one we sometimes zig while others zag we also sometimes zig while others zig and its all a situational kind of thing the primary the reason that were kind of leaning into this marketing guidance relative to the next quarter is more just how low it is now not to look at that and say that at that low level its going to sustain itself so let me just give you a little more context here we pulled back in certain channels early in the crisis in response to the decreased opportunity for quality growth and just given the unprecedented uncertainty early on weve since reentered most channels and its interesting while marketing was flat overall in the company within card marketing increased through the quarter again it was mostly just coming off such a very low level and so what we are saying is you have the seasonal ramp that always happens in the fourth quarter at capital one and then on top of that because even though our marketing was flat within the quarter companywide within card it was quite low and so were really saying just the full seasonal the full quarter effect of that will also pull the numbers a fair amount higher so its really more a pulling up from being so low as opposed to a statement of a big transformation and how much marketing and growth were going after here ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc okay in your prepared remarks you talked about capital return being an important part of the picture for shareholders if we look the capital ratios are at and once we get through the next few quarters it should be at at least or over of your market cap in excess now i know we saw a handful of things that we need to get through the fed stress test but it seems like if we have the minimum from the scb of and your internal target of it seems like you have the potential to get pretty aggressive on returning capital so if you maybe just talk about the capital priorities and how quickly do you think you can manage the capital down once we have clarity on where the economy is headed thanks richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yeah thanks ryan well as you know all the large banks are going through ccar right now and as i mentioned were going to get through that process and get our feedback before we make any adjustments to our capital situation capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 i think that as you talked about with the stress capital buffer the buffer for us under that framework or the total capital required under that framework is we want to operate in most environments with a buffer above that so probably over i think that what im hoping is that well start to see the fed move away from the current level of restrictions in that in the first quarter they will migrate to the stress capital buffer framework which should allow us to manage our capital distributions both dividends and share repurchases on a much more dynamic basis and as we talked about and you mentioned in our the comments we do appreciate that this is an important component of shareholder return and so were looking to get back into the business of having an appropriate amount of capital and making sure the shareholders are receiving distributions jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from rick shane with jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my question this afternoon rich you in response to sanjays question touched on something that i think is really interesting you mentioned divergence between labor markets and credit markets and credit performance and you hypothesized whether or not what weve seen is a delay in credit events or were actually going to see moderation from all of the policy initiatives so you alluded to the fact that you think its the latter i want to make sure i want to understand in part what drives that view and then i want to turn the question to scott and ask where is the reserve or the allowance in that context are you still more reserved in the delay scenario at this point richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah rick i want to make sure that i articulate for a second your two just articulate for a second your two scenarios the delay scenario described what youre saying that is that would be its going to get as bad as ever its just delayed in getting there and the moderation indiscernible richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc exactly richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp moderated yeah so yeah ill let scott talk about the allowance just sort of its there have been well certainly right now there is the divergence between the two is extraordinary i do think that and then the most common thing everybody is talking about is government stimulus and i believe that is an important effect capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 i wouldnt underestimate the collective impact of forbearance across the banking industry as well and to some extent in rents and other things but between the strength of the consumer entered the downturn and the various things that are providing some relief it is clearly disconnecting the relationship that we would otherwise see between unemployment and the consumers financial health and credit performance so the i think it is very plausible that this sort of bank account if you will of cumulatively some good things that the consumer has had available is something that is finite and very plausibly cant last for an extended period of time i think it still buffers for a short period of time but if we dont see stimulus and if the economy continues to really be hurting i have trouble envisioning how the consumer doesnt end up getting in a worse place from here but my points are i think that timing of that can still be buffered by the accumulated benefits and then my other point is that i think burrowing through the tunnel i picture a big mountain which is the bad economy going up and then going down on the other side burrowing through the tunnel and even then if the consumer has to rejoin that bad mountain if you will a strain metaphor i think that some of the worst aspects of that downturn will have been averted by virtue of every month that passes what i want to do is pivot to scott to comment on how weve handled the allowance richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yeah thanks rich rick so if you think about what we have to do in the allowance were starting with delinquency levels that are not connected to the level of unemployment that were seeing and so one of the things that we have to do in the allowance is to take those delinquency levels and over time kind of get them to link up with unemployment levels one of the reasons that we are thinking thats happening is that some of the stimulus actually comes in in a form where its replacing income and so even though youve got elevated level of unemployment you basically are you have a consumer who may be unemployed counting in the unemployed calculations but is receiving benefits that are allowing them to stay current as if they were fully employed so as we start to see stimulus unfold here the real question that we face in the allowance is just how long is that income replacement going to continue and what does that mean to the total loss content so those are the kinds of issues that we would face with the allowance richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it thats very helpful and rich i do appreciate the metaphor as well thank you guys richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp thank you rick jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research thanks good evening rich can you discuss the competitive landscape as you think about the potential threats on one hand from the neobank sort of the chimes of the world that operate exclusively online without traditional branch networks in this sort of postcovid environment and on the other hand the buy now pay later like the klarnas and afterpays how do you see their presence impacting the competitive environment in the card business say over the next three to five years i mean is there any potential benefit to deploying some of your excess capital into ma and what are those areas or are those sort of capabilities things that you think you can build on your own richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp so well bill its certainly quite fascinating and striking to see whats happening on both the banking side and the lending side with respect to these new competitors let me talk about the buy now pay later phenomenon there has been point of sale lending for forever basically and its always been there as another form of financing and its interesting in many ways the credit card became the disruptor in pointofsale lending i never forget when early on in the capital one journey i ran into this guy who said hey you ruined my business and i said im so sorry how did we ruin your business and he said i ran a furniture store i made my money on financing and the credit card has kind of put me out of business and so the credit card has been an incredibly efficient tool in a world where pointofsale financing has continued and theres logical reasons they both would coexist i think its really striking what has happened recently with respect to the buy now pay later which theres a couple of striking things going on that are not havent been part of the historical context one is the just the technology the ease of the whole thing and with a single click you can kind of buy now pay later that has been one aspect of this and the other is the that merchants are paying the lenders at this point the way the marketplace works merchants paying the lenders which has allowed us to be a pretty financially attractive business for some of these neo players and has helped keep that industry unassailable a lot of times you have a race to the bottom in terms of how high the shortterm pricing gets et cetera so this is something thats growing rapidly and i think that its something that we are looking carefully at and watching and trying to assess where that market is going we wonder how sustainable the revenue model of that is with respect to the merchant subsidies in a more competitive marketplace so well have to keep an eye on that but i think the this is another example of how digital technology and the realtime instant solutions is where the entire world is going the history of banking is to deliver solutions on a batch basis to consumers and i think this is another example of how realtime solutions are here and all banks if they dont increasingly figure out how to leverage data in real time and bring instant customized solutions to consumers may find themselves in a bad place then you got the whole banking side of the marketplace the chimes and some of the other players that i think also have created a disruptive model we tend to root for their success because we are also a disruptor in this marketplace and the more collectively all of us can get at the make progress against the highly inertial entrenched behavior of americans to always bank with their branch bank the more we can chip away collectively with that i think the more opportunity there is for all of us digital players capital one included but were certainly inspired by some of the things that we see by some of the neobanks capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research thats super helpful rich thank you if i can squeeze in another quick one on auto can you discuss how your mix of new versus used originations has evolved and whether theres any particular area that youve been leaning into more heavily richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp theres not well theres been a lot of used of course just some of the market conditions that have led to the a lot of used car buying so i dont have in front of me data with respect to that so the used car opportunity is a sweet spot for most banks because the captive lenders tend to subsidize their new car purchases so the majority of our entire business is used and the more the used car market thrives the better it is for capital one i think the bigger effect thats going on that were struck by in addition to just how all the sort of the tide of auto has risen all the boats for all the players and its just kind of a strikingly sort of good time in the industry parenthetically we should all know in the middle of the massive pandemic so we got to be very careful here but kind of on little cat feet the traction that were seeing with our digital strategy is particularly were seeing in auto because of the very physical nature of how the product is bought and this is an example of where the pandemic is accelerating things that would happen anyway but in the auto space the more they accelerate the sort of direct side not necessarily the pure direct where no one ever goes to a dealership but the semi direct or the hybrid direct the thing that just involves faster more digital solutions that plays into the hand of capital one because weve invested for years in realtime automated solutions and being able to underwrite any car in america on any lot in less than a second and to be able to provide that information to consumers before they go into a dealership and to also lessen the amount of hard work and waiting once you get in jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from don fandetti with wells fargo please go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc rich i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what youre seeing in your commercial real estate portfolio and also given the stress are there any opportunistic opportunities that you see coming to market richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp so our commercial real estate is billion across a range of property types relative to most banks overall our portfolio is more concentrated in multifamily which we view as more resilient while its underweight in more volatile sectors like hotel retail office and construction so in the multifamily space we have billion in exposure to multifamily about billion is on balance sheet and about billion in agency loss share capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 and of that of the billion we have on balance sheet about half of our exposure is in the new york metropolitan area and as you know don there are real borrower challenges in the market with low rent collections and eviction moratoriums so our focus and the significant majority of our portfolio is in rentregulated and class b properties which have been historically more resilient in recessions so the big increase in criticized performing loans was in the multi family portfolio we feel really good about the ltv the low ltvs that we have backing this book but it certainly has our attention that new yorks got a number of challenges on the real estate side and so well very carefully monitor how this plays out but we feel collectively very good about our overall real estate portfolio and the choices that drove us to where we are donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse please go ahead moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks rich at the front end of the questions you talked a little bit about some of the differences between this and the great recession i guess another one would be the banks and card issuers themselves are actually in a better position than they were at that point and im just wondering if you could kind of talk a little bit about how you think that impacts the competitive opportunity and what youre willing to talk about what capital ones plans are with respect to that richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah its a really insightful comment that you make moshe because one of the things that we know that happened in the great recession is the consumer was more levered up but you also had the banking industry both banks and nonbanks were providing products that were not nearly as well underwritten that often had complicated features with them and there was just a lot of disequilibrium to sort out and that really compounded the consumers journey through the downturn that their own condition and also working through some of the things the most extreme of course moshe was the mortgage products and all the issues there so the and what happened is a lot of the bad lending practices id say bad from a credit risk point of view and also certain consumer practices got driven out in the great recession and on the other side of it was a very rational highperforming credit card marketplace and ive said for years on the other side of the great recession i think this is a strikingly rational marketplace i find it more rational than the other lending marketplaces in which we compete and each of the players there sort of has carved out a particular niche and theyre doing well capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 so i see moshe very rational behavior even right now in the pandemic virtually everybody pulled back first of all you start with card players have something happening to them that basically is pretty unique across lending products and that is that our portfolios are shrinking pretty dramatically here in commercial in general people drawing down online increase the volumes moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc right richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp so i think that we card players are struck by oh my goodness just with the less spending and all this conservative behavior by consumers weve been going backwards pretty rapidly pretty much all of us have and but i think that that is the flip side of what comes from the strikingly sound and conservative behavior of our consumers so where does the industry go from here i think the industry has pulled back and i think all of us in our own way are trying to figure out no ones going to fully step on the bad gas no one is all the way pulled back and i think for everyone its how to find the selective opportunities where you can continue to lean into this thing and book business thats going to be resilient even if things get a whole lot worse and some of the tried and true strategies moshe weve had for many years are conservatism on credit lines the avoidance of high balance revolvers and so on our strategy has been so resiliencefocused i think that for us the opportunity to continue to book accounts be very conservative on credit lines build up the potential energies but continue to be but being careful on credit lines book the grow the potential energy and delay the release to some extent into kinetic energy through a lot of line growth until we see more clarity on where this economy is going so thats how were continuing to lean in even in the context of this pretty electrifying economy moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thanks rich and maybe a followup question there for scott i noticed that revenue suppression had improved fairly significantly i guess that works relative to actual delinquencies and maybe you could just talk a little bit about how thats going to look going forward richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yeah youre right the suppression is a shorter coverage period than allowance it really only goes through the point of chargeoff and when youve got low delinquencies thats improved so as long as we see stability in our delinquency levels that would stay at about the levels where it is now we started to see them delinquencies worsen that would increase the amount of suppression moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thanks capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator and for our final question this evening will come from brian foran with autonomous please go ahead brian foran q analyst autonomous research oh hi pretty much everything has been asked i guess just on marketing i guess the normal seasonal increase would be maybe million million maybe million million actually a normal level would be maybe more like million or million so are there any i know youre not going to give a point estimate but are there any guardrails you should you could give maybe are we thinking more like a normal seasonal increase to the low million or are we thinking more like a normal seasonal level to the mid500 million in terms of something to pencil in on marketing for the fourth quarter richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp brian were probably going to leave our guidance where it is but the main thing we wanted people to just know that its been unusually low at this point and dont get too used to the unusually low level and that so thats why its the double effect were calling for the double effect of the normal significant seasonal increase that we have in the fourth quarter around things like our sponsorships and a lot of things that happen late in the year as well as the continuation of what happened late in the quarter against our marketing levels in cards a phenomenon that was not visible in the aggregated credit numbers because it just turned out by coincidence some of the marketing elsewhere in the company around retail which had really been sort of higher right out of the gate with all the deposit inflows that weve had we pulled back somewhat on retail brian foran q analyst autonomous research fair enough i think there was once a quarter in when you did million in marketing and i built that into a normalized earnings model so its fair fair to remind people ph about these things thats going on richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay well brian thank you jeff norris senior
