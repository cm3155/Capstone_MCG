the sec now ill turn the call over to mr young andrew andrew m young chief financial officer capital one financial corp thanks jeff and good afternoon everyone i will start on slide of tonights presentation in the third quarter capital one earned billion or per diluted common share included in the results for the quarter were adjusting items related to discover integration costs and a small downward revision to our fdic special assessment estimate net of these adjusting items third quarter earnings per share were preprovision earnings in the third quarter increased from the second quarter to billion revenue in the linked quarter increased driven by higher net interest income noninterest expense increased driven by increases in both operating expense and marketing spend provision for credit losses was billion in the quarter down billion relative to the prior quarter the quarterly decrease was primarily driven by the absence of the second quarters onetime allowance build for the termination of the walmart partnership a decline in the coverage ratio in card and a million decrease in net chargeoffs turning to slide i will cover the allowance in greater detail we released million in allowance this quarter and our allowance balance now stands at billion our total portfolio coverage ratio decreased basis points to the decrease in this quarters allowance and coverage ratio was largely driven by allowance releases in our card and consumer banking segments ill cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on slide in our domestic card business we released million of allowance which decreased coverage by basis points to our credit outlook has improved slightly as our confidence in the stability of underlying credit trends has grown driving a modest release in allowance in our consumer banking segment we released million in allowance resulting in a 10basis point decrease to our coverage ratio the release was driven by strong credit performance and increasing recoveries in our auto business and finally our commercial banking allowance decreased by million resulting in the coverage ratio remaining essentially flat at turning to page ill now discuss liquidity total liquidity reserves in the quarter increased about billion to approximately billion our cash position ended the quarter at approximately billion up about billion from the prior quarter driven primarily by continued strong deposit growth our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the third quarter was up from in the second quarter capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 turning to page ill cover our net interest margin our third quarter net interest margin was basis points higher than last quarter and basis points higher than the yearago quarter the sequential increase in nim was largely the result of three factors first we had higher card and auto yields as a reminder the card yield benefited from a full quarter impact of the termination of the of the revenue sharing agreement with walmart the removal of revenue sharing increased the total company nim by basis points quarteroverquarter and basis points relative to the year ago quarter second there was additional day in the third quarter and finally we had a higher mix of card loans on the balance sheet turning to slide i will end by discussing our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio ended the quarter at basis points higher than the prior quarter higher net income in the quarter was partially offset by the impact of dividends loan growth and million of share repurchases as a reminder the announcement of the acquisition of discover constituted a material business change therefore we continued to be subject to the federal reserves preapproval of our capital actions until the merger approval process has concluded with that i will turn the call over to rich rich richard d fairbank founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thank you andrew and good evening everyone slide shows third quarter results in our credit card business credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends which are shown on slide in the third quarter our domestic card business delivered another quarter of top line growth strong margins and stable credit yearoveryear purchase volume growth for the quarter was ending loan balances increased billion or about yearoveryear average loans increased about and third quarter revenue was up driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans revenue margin for the quarter increased basis points yearoveryear to the full quarter effect of the end of the walmart revenue sharing agreement drove a 51basis point yearoveryear increase excluding this impact the revenue margin would have been about the chargeoff rate for the quarter was the full quarter impact of the end of the walmart loss sharing agreement increased the quarterly chargeoff rate by basis points excluding this impact the chargeoff rate for the quarter would have been up basis points yearoveryear the 30plus delinquency rate at quarter end was up basis points from the prior year as a reminder the end of the walmart loss sharing agreement did not have a meaningful impact on the delinquency rate the pace of yearoveryear increases in both the chargeoff rate and the delinquency rate have been steadily declining for several quarters and continued to shrink in the third quarter capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 on a sequential quarter basis the chargeoff rate excluding the walmart impact was down basis points and the 30plus delinquency rate was up basis points both sequential quarter trends are consistent with seasonal expectations domestic card noninterest expense was up compared to the third quarter of primarily driven by higher marketing expense total company marketing expense in the quarter was billion up yearover year our choices in domestic card are the biggest driver of total company marketing we continue to see compelling growth opportunities in our domestic card business our marketing continues to deliver strong new account growth across the domestic card business compared to the third quarter of domestic card marketing in the quarter included increased marketing to grow originations at the top of the market higher media spend and increased investment in differentiated customer experiences like our travel portal airport lounges and capital one shopping slide shows third quarter results in our consumer banking business auto originations were up yearover year in the third quarter our stable credit performance which is the result of choices weve made over the past couple of years puts us in a strong position to lean into current origination opportunities in the market consumer banking ending loans were essentially flat yearoveryear and average loans were down on a linked quarter basis ending loans and average loans were both up compared to the year ago quarter both ending and average consumer deposits were up about consumer banking revenue for the quarter was down about yearoveryear largely driven by higher deposit costs compared to the prior year quarter noninterest expense was up about compared to the third quarter of driven largely by continued technology investments and increased auto originations the auto chargeoff rate for the quarter was up basis points yearoveryear the 30plus delinquency rate was down three basis points yearoveryear largely as the result of our choice to tighten credit and pull back in auto chargeoffs have been strong and stable slide shows third quarter results for our commercial banking business compared to the linked quarter ending loan balances decreased about average loans were down about the modest declines are largely the result of choices we made in to tighten credit ending deposits were up about from the linked quarter average deposits were down about we continue to manage down selected less attractive commercial deposit balances third quarter revenue was up from the linked quarter and noninterest expense was up by about the commercial banking annualized net chargeoff rate for the third quarter increased basis points from the sequential quarter to the commercial banking criticized performing loan rate was down basis points compared to the linked quarter the criticized nonperforming loan rate increased basis points to in closing we continued to post strong results in the third quarter we delivered another quarter of top line growth in domestic card loans purchase volume and revenue in the auto business we saw yearoveryear growth in originations for the third consecutive quarter and consumer credit trends remained stable capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 our yeartodate operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments through september was we had guided to annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments to be modestly down compared to the we posted in our view included the positive impact from the end of the revenue sharing related to the walmart partnership and assumed the cfpb late fee rule would take effect in october looking forward we now expect the full year annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments to be in the low we expect a sequential quarter increase in operating expense in the fourth that will be roughly in line with historical patterns as we continue to invest in our technology transformation and we are no longer assuming that the cfpb late fee rule will be implemented in given ongoing uncertainty around industry litigation our view of marketing has not changed we continue to lean into marketing to grow and to further strengthen our franchise in the domestic card business we continue to get traction in originations across our products and channels in consumer banking were leaning into marketing to grow our digitalfirst national banking franchise we continue to expect total company marketing in the second half of to be meaningfully higher than in the first half similar to the pattern we saw last year and that includes the much higher marketing levels that we typically see in the fourth quarter and turning to the discover acquisition were working closely with the regulators as our applications continue to work their way through the regulatory approval process separately discover mentioned in their press release and on their earnings call last week that they continue to work in parallel with the sec to resolve comments regarding their accounting approach for their card misclassification matter as soon as that process wraps up we expect to mail out a joint proxy and to schedule a shareholder vote most likely early next year we remain well positioned to get shareholder and regulatory approvals and we expect to be in a position to complete the acquisition early in subject to regulatory and shareholder approval pulling way up the acquisition of discover is a singular opportunity it will create a consumer banking and global payments platform with unique capabilities modern technology powerful brands and a franchise of more than million customers it delivers compelling financial results and offers the potential to enhance competition and create significant value for merchants and customers and now well be happy to answer your questions jeff jeff norris senior vice president of finance capital one financial corp thank you rich we will now start the qa session remember as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single followup if you have any further questions after the qa session the investor relations team will be available after the call josh please start the qa capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from ryan nash with goldman sachs you may proceed ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good afternoon everyone richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp hey ryan andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hey ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so rich maybe just start on credit you obviously have you can see lots of different parts of the consumer market highend consumer subprime prime private label different parts of auto and you guys seem to be bucking the trend with really solid credit results so i think some others arent so maybe can you just talk about what youre seeing across consumer in some of these different cohorts and maybe what do you think it means for where losses could be headed in some of your main asset classes thanks i have a followup richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay thank you ryan so let me just pull up and just talk first about the health of the consumer i think the us consumer remains a source of relative strength in the overall economy think about this the labor market remains strong we saw signs of softening in the first half of and the unemployment rate picked up a bit but the most recent data points on unemployment and job creation have actually shown renewed strength incomes are growing in real terms and last month we saw a significant upward revision of the savings rate consumer debt servicing burdens are stable relative to prepandemic levels and consumers have higher average bank account balances than before the pandemic now we see some pockets of pressure related to sort of the cumulative effects of inflation and elevated interest rates and we are almost certainly still seeing a thing that weve been calling out for years even really before it happened saying we think it inevitably will happen and but we wont fully be able to measure that we wont be able to measure that along the way but that is delayed chargeoffs from the pandemic period we should remember that millions of consumers who would have charged off under normal circumstances in and avoided defaulting thanks to unprecedented stimulus and forbearance and these consumers were on the edge and they got a lifeline but for some of them their underlying vulnerability remains so i believe that what were seeing today is some catching up from that period of historically low chargeoffs capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 so id say consumers on the whole are in good shape compared to most historical benchmarks but i do think theres some pockets of pressure that will persist until we fully work through this cycle essentially of inflation and elevated interest rates and of course for an unmeasurable period of time there will be i think this delayed chargeoff effect from the pandemic so thats a comment ryan sort of on the consumer generally you said you had another question of course i can get into capital ones individual credit as well but why dont i hear where you want to take this ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah and it would be helpful if you can comment on capital one specifically but maybe ill throw another question for andrew and you guys can handle both of them so andrew obviously there was a big beat on the net interest margin and the fed has begun easing im just curious if you can maybe just talk about the drivers and expectations from the margin for the margin from here and just given youve historically operated in this kind of to or to range but given the balance sheet the changing balance sheet dynamics do you think weve sort of broken out of that range thanks andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yeah ryan look as i think about the nim in the near term i enumerated the driving forces of what led to the increase this quarter but in the near term outside of seasonal effects we have one modest likely headwind which as you can see in our disclosures is that were asset sensitive and so that will put a bit of pressure on nim in the immediate term but we also have one potential tailwind ill call it and that is the pace of card growth relative to the rest of the balance sheet and youve seen that be a tailwind to nim all else equal over the last few quarters longer term i think theres a few headwinds and tailwinds the tailwind being again card even beyond the next few quarters weve seen strong growth particularly relative to the rest of our balance sheet ive highlighted in the past that our current levels of cash are likely above where we think they will eventually settle out and if we were to see a steepening of the yield curve thats also a good guide to us all else equal on the headwind side i think theres a question of where betas go from here and theres a possibility that they could be slower or lower depending on a host of factors we could maintain cash levels for some period of time at least especially in light of the strong deposit growth were seeing and then always theres a little bit of a wildcard of the path of credit right and so if for some reason it stays elevated the potential revenue suppression could be a headwind but overall i would say taking all of those factors into account youve kind of seen the stability over the last few quarters prior to this one and a stepup here in the third quarter and so ill let you kind of weigh all of the headwinds and tailwinds that i just laid out for you ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thank you richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 so ryan let me just i talk generally about the consumer let me talk a little bit about capital one specifically what we see and this is of course partly because of what i just said about the consumer and some capital one specific things as well so in the card business we our delinquencies and chargeoffs are consistent with normal seasonality now and its clear that our card credit has settled out its also clear that it settled out above prepandemic levels and sort of theres three main reasons for this first we still have relatively lower recoveries compared to before the pandemic as a result of historically low chargeoffs in the rearview mirror and therefore in our chargeoff inventory so our recovery rate per dollar of chargeoffs has been stable if anything in fact a bit better than before the pandemic but just the inventory remains below prepandemic levels but its rising its heading toward returning to the prepandemic levels so this effect will diminish over the next few quarters we would expect secondly we believe the cumulative effects of inflation and the higher interest rates are creating affordability pressures for some consumers particularly those whose incomes have not kept pace with inflation or have higher debt servicing burden so we think thats a factor and to your point im actually not making a point about the lowend of the market whether measured by income or credit score generally speaking weve seen stronger relative income growth at the lower end of the distribution since and customers with the highest debt servicing burdens tend to skew more prime than sub prime so and then of course the other factor that we would point out as to why chargeoffs are settling out above the prepandemic levels is the delayed chargeoff effect that we think is still playing through just back if i could just throw in an industry point just for a second i should have mentioned this probably earlier because this isnt really a capital one effect but i think that what we see in industry data is that post pandemic origination vintages are running at higher risk level than prepandemic vintages probably because of inflated credit scores during the pandemic and thats an industry point not a capital one point because and then here ryan is when you mentioned that youre seeing capital one credit in some cases move differently from some of the industry trends at capital one we anticipated these effects related to some of the unusual things going on during the pandemic and particularly the what we might say is the great inflation of credit scores so we tightened our underwriting back in and when credit was the best weve ever seen and as credit normalized we continued to make adjustments where we saw pockets of rising risk what i was saying along the way where we kept trimming around the edges so the result for capital one has been relatively stable performance on our recent originations now for a long time which are really running at similar levels of risk to pre pandemic vintages but i do think there is some underlying worsening in the marketplace that may be showing up elsewhere that some of our choices were able to offset so pulling way up our credit results we feel are strong and stable driven by the choices that weve made through the pandemic and the postpandemic period and we feel very good about where we are and its an important reason that we are leaning in as you can see in terms of our originations in the business i can talk about auto at some point but maybe ill wait for another question on that capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you our next question comes from sanjay sakhrani with kbw you may proceed sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you good evening just following up on credit sorry just rich you had mentioned maybe it was last quarter or the quarter before that we should start to see the credit the delinquency improvements do better than seasonality and i guess stabilized at its moving along with seasonality is some of that related to the stuff you were just talking about or do you still expect the improvement to be better than seasonality at some point richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp well at some point of course can be a long time but no let me just say that i dont recall saying that we expected credit to be better than seasonality i think what we have been saying over the last number of months for a long time we said credit is normalizing we are on the absolute lookout for the very early signs of credit normalizing which it should where exactly it will normalize who knows until we actually get there and so way back to more than a year ago starting interestingly in the lower end of the market we were pointing out that we see the signs of credit stabilizing of course we all went down that ski slope of second derivative and that continues to be a strong effect but these are all things sanjay that are going on related to credit stabilizing and we have not declared that we think credit is in fact headed down from here at some point we can in another question go through the potential case for that i want to say one other thing though you mentioned seasonality and i put a marker down last quarter about a potential seasonality a change in seasonality patterns that id like to just kind of seize the moment and comment on this because i think all of you that are watching the credit patterns on a monthly basis its really important that we talk about the seasonality benchmark to which to compare that so lets talk for a moment about how seasonality works our portfolio in fact tends to have more pronounced seasonal patterns than the industry average the second quarter tends to be the seasonal low point for delinquencies and the fourth quarter tends to be the seasonal high point card losses lag relative to delinquencies the losses tend to be seasonally the lowest in the third quarter and highest in the first quarter now we have always thought and still do that tax refunds are a significant driver of these seasonal trends and tax refunds drive a large seasonal improvement in delinquent payments in the februarymarch time period which flows through to lower delinquencies in aprilmay and then the lower chargeoffs in the augustseptember timeframe tax refunds also drive a seasonal uptick in our recoveries now a few years ago the tax withholding rules changed leading to fewer tax refunds and lower average refund payments and the irs was paying certain refunds later than before because of fraudrelated issues that they had seen so we were watching all this but there was so much noise in the payment data due to the pandemic that we were unsure to what extent credit seasonality patterns had changed capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 so in the first half of this year as credit metrics settled out we flagged that the combined effect of lower and later tax refunds as the the more it settles out the more we can sort of see these underlying patterns that we flagged that this combined effect was likely affecting our nearterm credit performance by delaying and muting the usual seasonal improvement that we see in the second quarter but we didnt want to go to the highest mountain top and declare that because we wanted to make sure we werent explaining away credit numbers that in fact looked worse than seasonally what you would expect we also at the time believed that we would see more muted seasonal increases in delinquencies in the third quarter on the other side of that effect and weve now had several quarters to look at this and that experience has been confirmatory and now that were in a sense credit is coming in better than the old seasonal patterns so weve seen both the worst side and the better side i think we can pullup and really sort of declare this effect really seems to be happening settled out with fewer refunds paid than before the pandemic and about lower total refund volume in real terms so what were basically seeing and pulling way up is that seasonality which has we believe is driven predominantly by tax refunds as tax refunds become less of an effect not surprisingly in fact were seeing seasonality that has less amplitude to it so thats i think the seasonality that we observe now and when weve done sort of an adjusted look at last year we definitely think that we see the new trend by the way on the auto side all of this happens in auto seasonality but in an even faster and more concentrated way so i think i just wanted to share that with you but i think what weve really been declaring here sanjay is that its theres just such a confirmation that that credit is really settling out here sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc maybe my followup question would be the question you were looking for later whats the path to normalization and i guess for credit as well as the reserve rate were well above the levels we were in maybe you and andrew can tag team on that one thank you richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so why dont i start andrew so the were really really pleased with how card credit is settled out after quite a period of normalization so looking ahead while were not giving guidance on future credit i just want to point out a number of forces that play out so the one force of course is the thing that we believe so strongly is there but we cant measure it is the phenomenon of delayed chargeoffs if you kind of look at the area under the curve of all the chargeoffs that sort didnt happen we dont believe all of that area will play out over time but if you look at the area below the curve and compare it to the area in a sense above the curve now one can see that conceptually there could be still quite a bit of in a sense delayed inventory that could happen i just want to flag that effect i think its going to moderate at some point but i think that effect will be with us for some time another factor is the recoveries inventory that continues to rebuild and should be a gradual tailwind to our losses over time all else being equal and then the moderating inflation i think is a good guy for card credit but still high interest rate are probably a source of pressure at the tails for some consumers especially those with higher capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 debt servicing burdens and of course the economy will be a factor too but those are just some of the forces i think are going to be at work as credit plays out here sanjay andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp and then with respect to allowance sanjay obviously well be allowing for growth so thats the starting point on a dollar basis i suspect you are more focused on coverage so let me talk in coverage terms first and just very tactically as a reminder nearterm the fourth quarter we typically have seasonally higher balances and those balances just have lower coverage because of the highlevels of expected payments so all else equal and i stress that point but that would put downward pressure on coverage in the fourth quarter but in hearing your question i think youre looking for a longerterm view so first the coverage over time is going to primarily be driven by our loss forecast and our confidence in those estimates and so rich just kind of shared the things that well be looking for and what will ultimately be driving those forecasts but how the allowance then plays out relative to that i think its important to note that even if we find ourselves in future quarters where our projected losses are lower than the projected losses in the current quarters forecast we might see only modest declines in coverage as we incorporate uncertainties related to those projections but eventually that lower loss forecast if and when it comes through would theoretically flow through the allowance and bring the coverage ratio down as those uncertainties become more certain and so the direction of travel in that scenario would be down the pace and timing would obviously depend on a variety of factors because you mentioned though cecl day i guess ill end sanjay just as a reminder one other callout using cecl day as a rough proxy for a throughthecycle coverage assumption its important to note that embedded in cecl day was the loss sharing agreement with walmart and so with the termination of that agreement the roughly basis point impact to allowance coverage that we recognized last quarter i just want to make sure that as youre thinking about cecl day excluding the walmart effect that roughly percent is actually more like hopefully that gives you though a sense of the direction of travel jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you our next question comes from terry ma with barclays you may proceed terry ma q analyst barclays capital inc hello thank you good evening i wanted to touch on the auto business and ask kind of what youre seeing in the competitive environment and how youre thinking about growth going forward capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 you called out originations have been positive the last three quarters and looks like loan growth is going to turn positive i know youre still mindful of used car prices so should we expect more measured growth in auto going forward richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so yeah thank you terry our auto originations as you say theyve been growing now i guess its the last three quarters and as we stated in our prior calls in and in early we had anticipated risk and pull back on our originations and even as the vehicle values have been declining the credit performance on both our frontbook and our back book remains very strong so additionally just talking about some industry factors some of the headwinds that the industry has been facing with high interest rates and high vehicle prices are now easing as the interest rates have started to come down and vehicle values are down from their peak although both of these remain higher than prepandemic levels so interest margins on our also very important interest margins on our front book have increased and credit has stabilized and were seeing opportunities to grow in a resilient way so our strategy is to lean into areas that we like and that is supported by our very sophisticated underwriting and technology infrastructure our datadriven decisioning as well as deep relationships with our dealer network so looking ahead we feel good about our auto business and we feel we are well positioned to grow in a disciplined way targeting particularly what we think is the very resilient business terry ma q analyst barclays capital inc great thank you richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thank you terry jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you our next question comes from bill carcache with wolfe research securities you may proceed bill your line is now open bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good evening rich and andrew following up on your nim commentary andrew if credit continues to trend in line or potentially better than normal seasonality from here is it reasonable to expect revenue suppression would begin to serve as more of a nim tailwind that would arguably overwhelm some of the nim headwinds that you described in your earlier response capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp outside of seasonality bill which is an important qualifier to that but yes to the extent that credit is coming down in an absolute sense suppression is highly correlated with loss rates so over a period of time thats what we would expect to see bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks and then also another followup for you andrew on your reserve commentary in prior quarters qualitative overlays it seems and please correct me if im wrong it seems like it had the effect of preventing you from releasing reserves is it fair to conclude that this quarters reserve release suggests you expect consumer credit conditions to continue to gradually improve from here to the point where that would support peak losses likely being or sorry peak reserve rates likely being behind us at this point andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp its hard to think about the qualitative factors in isolation bill because we look at the totality of the forecast and the economic backdrop and thats just one albeit important but component of thinking about the allowance overall so really the release this quarter was driven by the stability of underlying credit trends and just our confidence in those trends so thats really the driver that led to this quarters release bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you for taking my questions andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp thank you jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from don fandetti with wells fargo you may proceed donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi rich on the discover merger do you still feel like owning a network helps your position with regulatory approval i mean i guess the doj suit against visa does validate that im just trying to get a sense on whether or not you feel like your arguments are resonating with regulators and you have confidence in the deal closing richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so i think its this is an unusual deal in the sense that usually there is a player in a certain industry doing an acquisition of another player in that industry and certainly a part of the consideration is looking at those aspects capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 but the very unusual part here is two things first of all one is such an important part of this acquisition is buying a network something that we dont have so were not even in that part of the business but then secondly of course it is an acquisition buying a position in an industry that is getting a tremendous amount of scrutiny for how concentrated it is and the network that we are acquiring for example on the credit card side has gone from down to share in recent years and so certainly we are making a strong case that to a regulator that obviously has shown they care a lot about competition in that marketplace that we certainly believe that this is very procompetitive in that sense of course we also believe very much that on the credit card side the deal is procompetitive as well donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah and yeah yeah go ahead jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you our next question comes from john hecht with jefferies you may proceed john hecht q analyst jefferies llc afternoon guys thanks very much for taking my questions most of them have been asked and answered im wondering if you guys can maybe give us some color on spend trends the build business volumes weve heard that theres that the consumer is being a little bit more cautious and careful or responsible with their spending as opposed to reacting to some sort of weakness or concerns about the economy and im wondering what your opinion is on that and how that affects your business richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so john thank you the consumer spending has had a little bit of a wild ride over the past few years so just to reflect for a second on this at the start of the pandemic spend per customer plummeted then it surged as consumers resumed their spending and it has since been settling out since the beginning of our spend per customer has remained largely flat overall although it has begun to tick up in recent months so the spend growth that you see for capital one is really being driven by the growth in new accounts and the spending on those accounts and then we see just a little bit of a tick up in the last few months capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 just to while i know some people have kind of wondered if you doubleclick into the spend patterns discretionary and nondiscretionary spend have really the growth rates of them have been very stable lately and in fact the mix has been stable across incomes and ficos and is in line with prepandemic levels so we think things really have settled out in the card business with respect to spend and when we its really striking when we look at banking overall and pretty much the only industry thats really growing is the credit card industry and its been a tough way to make a living in most of the banking product areas and that of course i think the credit card continues to be part of a very important and multidecade macro trend with respect to the movement out of cash and checks and really into the incredibly convenient spending mechanisms of a credit card so i think theres sort of a macro tailwind that continues to help the industry and then i think for a lot of us companies certainly a few of us companies like capital one our strategies are very focused its what i call a spend first strategy so that a lot of what we do the choices we make on the marketing side on the credit side and really the business we want to be has a spend first lean to it and thats another benefit to our metrics thank you john john hecht q analyst jefferies llc thank you appreciate the color jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you our next question comes from mihir bhatia with bank of america you may proceed mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc good afternoon thank you for taking my question actually just following up kind of similar lines as johns question about spending maybe just drilling down specifically on the venture x portfolio and i was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about it its been in the market for a couple of years now just how much has it grown how material is it to the overall card business what are you seeing in terms of performance in that portfolio thats encouraging you to invest more in it just any additional details would be great thank you richard d fairbank a founder chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thank you mihir so we launched our venture x card in late and were very pleased with the market response and the customer engagement so far this launch is of course a continuation in our journey thats been many years in the making to win at the top of the market and that journey started years ago with the declaration and then we have continued to just sort of every year stretch a little higher and lean into the momentum and the brand strength that we were getting and our market position to be able to keep growing so venture x was a very important milestone in that journey and also very important in that journey to win at the top of the market was the launch of our capital one travel portal and the opening of capital one lounges as well as enhancements to our customers overall experience more broadly so and im sure you saw that actually in the third quarter of last year we then launched the capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 venture x business card and were also pleased with the market response and customer engagement so far as well so i guess the way while we dont give out the specific numbers on this we continue to be very pleased with our quest to win at the top of the market and both of these venture x products are getting a lot of traction so far and as you can see were leaning in quite a bit but again what i want to say is i think one of the of the mistakes that card companies sometimes make is to think about a quest to win at the top of the market related to were going to launch a particular product with these features i really want to stress that winning at the top of the market requires a sustained comprehensive effort to create experiences access to things that are unique and sort of something to tell your friends about lounges digital experience rewards of course and then a very important component of this is building the brand credibility to have be viewed as a premium player in that part of the marketplace so all of is what were investing in youve of course seen quite an increase in our marketing and a fair amount of that is in service of our continued quest at the top of the market but i would leave this one observation with you as well is that while you see the overall purchase volume growth rate for capital one when we break that data up by spend segment basically the higher the spend segment meaning the higher we reach up in the marketplace the faster our growth rate is which is a confirmation of the traction were getting but also not only in overall volume but the traction that were getting reaching farther up jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you our next question comes from chase haynes with evercore isi you may proceed john pancari q analyst evercore group llc its john pancari at evercore isi i wanted to just ask on capital cet1 ratio at i wanted to get your updated thoughts here on how you think about buyback in that context i know you had indicated that the discover transaction could impact the pace of buybacks ultimately but you still bought back about million in the third quarter so i wanted to get your updated thoughts there thanks andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yeah john look theres a few forces at play that impact how we think about capital management the first of course being the uncertainty around the endgame rule the reproposal provided some highlevel indications but the devil is in the details there not to mention the uncertainty on implementation timing second although its been moderating of course there still continues to be a degree of macroeconomic uncertainty but last and perhaps most importantly we have the pending discover acquisition and so post close capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 we will need to run both our internal assessment of the needs of the combined company but well also go through the feds ccar process to come up with our view and the feds view of the combined capital need combined company and to these capital need so those are the reasons why were operating at current levels and believe its prudent to do so and weve been at this million pace for a number of quarters once we are act under an scb regime well of course have flexibility to return capital as we see appropriate and you saw in late and early when we had excess capital we were returning that at something like billion a quarter in repurchases so if we were to find ourselves in a similar position we understand that returning excess capital is an important part of creating shareholder value and we have the ability to do so quickly but i go back to the forces at play of why were operating where we are right now john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it thank you andrew if i could just ask one more on the loan yield increase up about basis points this quarter how much of that increase was the impact from walmart for the full quarter and was there any impact on the apr from any increase to the apr in response to the proposed cfpb late fee rule thanks andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp john i just want to make sure i understand your question of the yields quarteroverquarter youre saying or like yearoveryear yield on card yeah yearoveryear yield in card is flat when you take into account the effect of walmart quarteroverquarter its really just the seasonality effect theres the partial quarter of walmart but yield is really the seasonal effects and partial quarter of walmart when youre comparing third quarter to the second quarter john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay got it okay thank you jeff norris a senior vice president of finance capital one financial corp next question please operator thank you and our final question comes from the line of jeff adelson with morgan stanley you may proceed jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good evening thanks for taking my question just one from me to follow up on johns question there just on the late fee rule i fully appreciate that things remain in flux at this point look can you give us any update in your latest thinking and how youre potentially preparing for that with any offsets or mitigating actions have any of those actions have been taken yet and i get that you talked on taking a more mindful approach here just wanted to make sure that this is still the same approach youre taking or if theres anything else we should be thinking about in our models here thank you capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp so thank you jeff so at this point were waiting for industry litigation to play out to see if and when the late fee rules go into effect and were not going to predict when that will happen as weve said before if the rule is implemented in its current form it will have a significant impact on our revenue but we also believe that the rule will have an impact on the marketplace including competition pricing customer behavior volumes credit the reality is that we have spent decades painstakingly building a customer first franchise with the fewest fees in the industry and extremely simple products we believe that weve been rewarded for these choices with better growth better attrition and better credit selection ultimately we will work backwards from what preserves our customer franchise our customer loyalty and credit resilience if the rule does go into effect relative to anything that weve done so far we really the only thing weve done is we did defer a few investments in anticipation of this rule being implemented if the ruling never happens we will likely go ahead and make these investments over time thank you jeff jeff norris senior vice president of finance capital one
