organizational alignment our business segment results are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a standalone business we use an internal management and reporting process to derive our business segment results our internal management and reporting process employs various allocation methodologies including funds transfer pricing to assign certain balance sheet assets deposits and other liabilities and their related revenues and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment total interest income and noninterest income are directly attributable to the segment in which they are reported the net interest income of each segment reflects the results of our funds transfer pricing process which is primarily based on a matched funding concept that takes into consideration market interest rates our funds transfer pricing process is managed by our centralized corporate treasury group and provides a funds credit for sources of funds such as deposits generated by our consumer banking and commercial banking businesses and a charge for the use of funds by each segment the allocation is unique to each business segment and acquired business and is based on the composition of assets and liabilities the funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and offbalance sheet products periodically the methodology and assumptions utilized in the funds transfer pricing process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors which may impact the allocation of

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make a number of judgments estimates and assumptions that affect

applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements we provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under part iiitem financial statements and supplementary datanote 1summary of significant accounting policies in our form 10k we have identified the following accounting estimates as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition our critical accounting policies and estimates are as follows loan loss reserves goodwill fair value customer rewards reserve we evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions capital one financial corporation cof goodwill we perform our goodwill impairment test annually on october at a reporting unit level as of our last annual test and as of september we had four reporting units credit card auto other consumer banking and commercial banking we are also required to test goodwill for impairment when a triggering event occurs that indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount the results of the annual goodwill impairment test for the commercial banking reporting unit indicated that the estimated fair value of the commercial banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by outside of our annual impairment testing process we monitor our reporting units for any triggering events while also performing qualitative assessments of impairment indicators during the third quarter we concluded there were no triggering events and completed our qualitative assessment of impairment indicators which included among other things an assessment of changes in macroeconomic conditions comparison of the actual results to those forecasted in the most recent annual impairment test and performing sensitivity analysis on key assumptions though this qualitative assessment concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the commercial banking reporting unit remained in excess of the carrying value as of september the amount by which the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value is estimated to have declined relative to the results of the annual impairment test we are currently in the process of performing our annual impairment test the results of which will be disclosed in our form 10k assumptions used in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit are judgmental and inherently uncertain a change in the economic conditions of a reporting unit such as declines in business performance as a result of industry or macroeconomic trends or changes in our strategy adverse impacts to loan or deposit growth trends decreases in revenue increases in expenses increases in credit losses increases in capital requirements deterioration of market conditions declines in longterm growth expectations adverse impacts of regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated cost of capital could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting units to decline in the future and increase the risk of a goodwill impairment in a future period there have been no additional

for our commercial banking customers loan modifications are also considered in the assignment of an internal risk rating in our credit card business the majority of our fdms receive an interest rate reduction and are placed on a fixed payment plan not exceeding months the effective interest rate on the loan immediately prior to the loan modification is used as the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment using the present value of expected cash flows if the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms generally resulting in any loan outstanding being reflected in the appropriate delinquency category and charged off in accordance with our standard chargeoff policy in our

exposed to market risk primarily from the following operations and activities traditional banking activities of deposit gathering and lending assetliability management activities including the management of investment securities shortterm and longterm borrowings and derivatives foreign operations in the uk and canada within our credit card business and customer accommodation activities within our commercial banking business we have enterprisewide risk management policies and limits approved by our board of directors which govern our market risk management activities our objective is to manage our exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and limits based on prevailing market conditions and longterm expectations we provide additional information below about our primary sources of market risk our market risk management strategies and the measures that we use to evaluate these exposures interest rate risk interest rate risk represents exposure to financial instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the differences in the timing between the maturities or repricing of assets and liabilities our balance sheet is structurally asset sensitive as our loans which are primarily floating rate or fixed rate with short durations reprice faster than our fixed rate debt and a portion of our deposits when interest rates change we take actions to capital one financial corporation cof reduce the interest rate risk from this structural balance sheet position primarily by investing in fixed rate securities in our investment portfolio and executing interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and changes in foreign exchange rates on our nondollardenominated funding and nondollar equity investments in foreign operations net interest income sensitivity our net interest income sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12month baseline net interest income resulting from movements in interest rates in addition to our existing assets and liabilities we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast we also incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit repricing which includes pricing lags and changes in deposit beta and mix as interest rates change and the prepayment sensitivity of our mortgage securities to the level of interest rates in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected net interest income we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates detailed in table below at the current level of interest rates our net interest income is expected to increase in higher rate scenarios and decrease in lower rate scenarios our current sensitivity to both upward and downward shocks is largely unchanged as compared to december as the increase in cash balances was offset by an increase in deposit beta which was driven by higher interest rates and mix shift toward higher rate paid deposit products cash balances reprice relatively rapidly whereas deposit rates reprice less with both lag and beta effects in the contexts used in this section beta refers to the percentage of deposit rate repricing relative to an external reference rate such as federal funds in our models deposit betas vary dynamically and by product type economic value of equity sensitivity our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities including derivative exposures resulting from movements in interest rates our economic value of equity sensitivity measure is calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities including derivatives and does not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected balance sheet changes similar to our net interest income sensitivity measure we incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit repricing and attrition which includes pricing lags and changes in deposit beta as interest rates change and the prepayment sensitivity of our mortgage securities to the level of interest rates other key assumptions used in the calculation include attrition assumptions for loans and other assets term structure modeling of interest rates and discount spreads in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates detailed in table below our current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity decreases in higher interest rate scenarios and increases in lower interest rate scenarios the decrease in higher rate scenarios is due to the declines in the projected value of our fixed rate assets being only partially offset by corresponding movements in the projected value of our deposits and other liabilities the pace of economic value of equity decrease is larger for the bps scenario as our deposits are assumed to reprice more rapidly in higher interest rate environments our current economic value of equity sensitivity increased as compared to december primarily due to an increase in deposit beta driven by higher interest rates and mix shift towards higher rate paid deposit products capital one financial corporation cof table shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected baseline net interest income and our current economic value of equity calculated under the methodology described above as of september and december in instances where an interest rate scenario would result in a rate less than we assume a rate of for that

estimated impact on economic value of equity basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points in addition to these industry standard measures we consider the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios in our internal interest rate risk management decisions we also regularly review the sensitivity of our interest rate risk metrics to changes in our key modeling assumptions such as our loan and deposit balance forecasts mortgage prepayments and deposit repricing limitations of market risk measures the interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information internallydeveloped assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments other market inputs such as interest rates market prices and interest rate volatility are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures we regularly evaluate update and enhance these assumptions models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates the sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on our existing balance sheet and in some cases expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions the strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis for further information on our interest rate exposures see part iitem financial statements and supplementary datanote 8derivative instruments and hedging activities capital one financial corporation cof foreign exchange risk foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies we are exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily from the intercompany funding denominated in pound sterling gbp and the canadian dollar cad that we provide to our businesses in the uk and canada and net equity investments in those businesses we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk due to changes in the dollardenominated value of future earnings and cash flows from our foreign operations and from our euro eurdenominated borrowings our nondollar denominated intercompany funding and eurdenominated borrowings expose our earnings to foreign exchange transaction risk we manage these transaction risks by using forward foreign currency derivatives and crosscurrency swaps to hedge our exposures we measure our foreign exchange transaction risk exposures by applying a us dollar appreciation shock against the value of the nondollar denominated intercompany funding and eurdenominated borrowings and their related hedges which shows the impact to our earnings from foreign exchange risk our nominal intercompany funding outstanding was million gbp and million gbp as of september and december respectively and billion cad as of both september and december our nominal eurdenominated borrowings outstanding were billion eur as of both september and december our nondollar equity investments in foreign operations expose our balance sheet to translation risk in aoci and our capital ratios we manage our aoci exposure by entering into foreign currency derivatives designated as net investment hedges we measure these exposures by applying a us dollar appreciation shock which we believe approximates a significant adverse shock over a oneyear time horizon against the value of the equity invested in our foreign operations net of related net investment hedges where applicable our gross equity exposures in our uk and canadian operations were billion gbp and billion gbp as of september and december respectively and billion cad and billion cad as of september and december respectively as a result of our derivative management activities we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal risk related to customer accommodation derivatives we offer interest rate commodity and foreign currency derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our commercial banking business we offset the majority of the market risk of these customer accommodation derivatives by entering into offsetting derivatives transactions with other counterparties we use valueatrisk var as the primary method to measure the market risk in our customer accommodation derivative activities on a daily basis var is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from movements observed in the recent market environment we employ a historical simulation approach using the most recent business days and use a percent confidence level and a holding period of one business day as a result of offsetting our customer exposures with other counterparties we believe that our net exposure to market risk in our customer accommodation

internal risk ratings we assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to repay their debt in determining the risk rating of a particular loan some of the factors considered are the borrowers current financial condition historical and projected future credit performance prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends the scale based on our internal risk rating system is as follows noncriticized loans that have not been designated as criticized frequently referred to as pass loans criticized performing loans in which the financial condition of the obligor is stressed affecting earnings cash flows or collateral values the borrower currently has adequate capacity to meet nearterm obligations however the stress left unabated may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects at some future date criticized nonperforming loans that are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged if any loans classified as criticized nonperforming have a welldefined weakness

generally placed on nonaccrual status we use our internal risk rating system for regulatory reporting determining the frequency of credit exposure reviews and evaluating and determining the allowance for credit losses generally loans that are designated as criticized performing and criticized nonperforming are reviewed quarterly by management to determine if they are appropriately classifiedrated

instruments and hedging activities use of derivatives and accounting for derivatives we regularly enter into derivative transactions to support our overall risk management activities our primary market risks stem from the impact on our earnings and economic value of equity due to changes in interest rates and to a lesser extent changes in foreign exchange rates we manage our interest rate sensitivity by employing several techniques which include changing the duration and repricing characteristics of various assets and liabilities by using interest rate derivatives we also use foreign currency derivatives to limit our earnings and capital exposures to foreign exchange risk by hedging exposures denominated in foreign currencies we primarily use interest rate and foreign currency swaps to hedge but we may also use a variety of other derivative instruments including caps floors options futures and forward contracts to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks we designate these risk management derivatives as either qualifying accounting hedges or freestanding derivatives qualifying accounting hedges are further designated as fair value hedges cash flow hedges or net investment hedges freestanding derivatives are economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting we also offer interest rate commodity foreign currency derivatives and other contracts as an accommodation to our customers within our commercial banking business we enter into these derivatives with our customers primarily to help them manage their interest rate risks hedge their energy and other commodities exposures and manage foreign currency fluctuations we offset the substantial majority of the market risk exposure of our customer accommodation derivatives through derivative transactions with other counterparties see below for additional information on our use of derivatives and how we account for them fair value hedges we designate derivatives as fair value hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities which fluctuate in value as a result of movements in interest rates changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are presented in the same line item in our consolidated statements of income as the earnings effect of the hedged items our fair value hedges primarily consist of interest rate swaps that are intended to modify our exposure to interest rate risk on various fixedrate financial assets and liabilities cash flow hedges we designate derivatives as cash flow hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci those amounts are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transactions impact earnings and presented in the same line item in our consolidated statements of income as the earnings effect of the hedged items our cash flow hedges use interest rate swaps and floors that are intended to hedge the variability in interest receipts or interest payments on some of our variablerate financial assets or liabilities we also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to intercompany borrowings denominated in foreign currencies net investment hedges we use net investment hedges to manage the foreign currency exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations that have functional currencies other than the us dollar changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in the translation adjustment component of aoci offsetting the translation gain or loss from those foreign operations we execute net investment hedges using foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the translation exposure of the net investment in our foreign operations under the forward method freestanding derivatives our freestanding derivatives primarily consist of our customer accommodation derivatives and other economic hedges the customer accommodation derivatives and the related offsetting contracts are mainly interest rate commodity and foreign currency contracts the other freestanding derivatives are primarily used to economically hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of our commercial mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments as well as other interests held changes in the fair value of freestanding derivatives are recorded in earnings as a component of other noninterest income capital one financial corporation cof derivatives counterparty credit risk counterparty types derivative instruments contain an element of credit risk that stems from the potential failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract including making payments due upon maturity of certain derivative instruments we execute our derivative contracts primarily in overthecounter otc markets we also execute interest rate and commodity futures in the exchangetraded derivative markets our otc derivatives consist of both trades cleared through central counterparty clearinghouses ccps and uncleared bilateral contracts the chicago mercantile exchange cme the intercontinental exchange ice and the lch group lch are our ccps for our centrally cleared contracts in our uncleared bilateral contracts we enter into agreements directly with our derivative counterparties counterparty credit risk management we manage the counterparty credit risk associated with derivative instruments by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements where applicable and exchanging collateral with our counterparties typically in the form of cash or highquality liquid securities we exchange collateral in two primary forms variation margin which mitigates the risk of changes in value due to daily market movements and is exchanged daily and initial margin which mitigates the risk of potential future exposure of a derivative and is exchanged at the outset of a transaction and adjusted daily we exchange variation margin and initial margin on our cleared derivatives for uncleared bilateral derivatives executed after september and in scope for initial margin we exchange variation margin and initial margin the amount of collateral exchanged for variation margin is dependent upon the fair value of the derivative instruments as well as the fair value of the pledged collateral and will vary over time as market variables change the amount of the initial margin exchanged is dependent upon the calculation of initial margin exposure as prescribed by 1a the us prudential regulators margin rules for uncleared derivatives pr rules or 1b the ccps for cleared derivatives and the fair value of the pledged collateral it will vary over time as market variables change when valuing collateral an estimate of the variation in price and liquidity over time is subtracted in the form of a haircut to discount the value of the collateral pledged our exposure to derivative counterparty credit risk at any point in time is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset on our balance sheet the fair value of our derivatives is adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and any associated collateral received or pledged see table for our net exposure associated with derivatives the terms under which we collateralize our exposures differ between cleared exposures and uncleared bilateral exposures ccps we clear eligible otc derivatives with ccps as part of our regulatory requirements we also clear exchangetraded instruments like futures with ccps futures commission merchants fcms serve as the intermediary between ccps and us ccps require

is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date the fair value accounting guidance provides a threelevel fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments this hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable the fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level valuation is based on quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level valuation is based on observable marketbased inputs other than level prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market valuation techniques include pricing models discounted cash flow dcf methodologies or similar techniques the accounting guidance for fair value measurements requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value we consider all available information including observable market data indications of market liquidity and orderliness and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category judgments are made regarding the significance of the observable or unobservable inputs to the instruments fair value measurement in its entirety if unobservable inputs are considered significant the instrument is classified as level the process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions the accounting guidance provides for the irrevocable option to elect on a contractbycontract basis to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and record any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings the determination and classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy is performed at the end of each reporting period we consider all available information including observable market data indications of market liquidity and orderliness and our understanding

value measurements of financial instruments such as changes in unobservable inputs may have a significant impact on fair value certain of these unobservable inputs will in isolation have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input alternatively the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input in general an increase in the discount rate default rates loss severity or credit spreads in isolation would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement in addition an increase in default rates would generally be accompanied by a decrease in recovery rates slower prepayment rates and an increase in liquidity spreads and would lead to a decrease in the fair value measurement techniques and inputs for level fair value measureme nts the following table presents the significant unobservable inputs used to determine the fair values of our level financial instruments on a recurring basis we utilize multiple vendor pricing services to obtain fair value for our securities several of our vendor pricing services are only able to provide unobservable input information for a limited number of securities due to software licensing restrictions other vendor pricing services are able to provide unobservable input information for all securities for which they provide a valuation as a result the unobservable input information for the securities available for sale presented below represents a composite summary of all information we are able to obtain the unobservable

assetliability management by our centralized corporate treasury group and residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments are included in the other category basis of presentation we report the results of each of our business segments on a continuing operations basis the results of our individual businesses reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources business segment reporting methodology the results of our business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a standalone business our internal management and reporting process used to derive our segment results employs various allocation methodologies including funds transfer pricing to assign certain balance sheet assets deposits and other liabilities and their related revenues and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment our funds transfer pricing process managed by our centralized corporate treasury group provides a funds credit for sources of funds such as deposits generated by our consumer banking and commercial banking businesses and a charge for the use of funds by each segment the allocation is unique to each business segment and acquired business and is based on the composition of assets and liabilities the funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and offbalance sheet products periodically the methodology and assumptions utilized in the funds transfer pricing process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the business segments due to the integrated nature of our business segments estimates and judgments have been made in allocating certain revenue and expense items transactions between segments are based on

primarily consist of credit card lines loan commitments to customers of both our commercial banking and consumer banking businesses as well as standby and commercial letters of credit these commitments other than credit card lines and certain other unconditionally cancellable lines of credit are legally binding conditional agreements that have fixed expirations or termination dates and specified interest rates and purposes the contractual amount of these commitments represents the maximum possible credit risk to us should the counterparty draw upon the commitment we generally manage the potential risk of unfunded lending commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities for unused credit card lines we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our customers will access their entire available line at any given point in time commitments to extend credit other than credit card lines generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards collateral requirements and loantovalue ltv ratios are the same as those for funded transactions and are established based on managements credit assessment of the customer these commitments may expire without being drawn upon therefore the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future funding requirements we also issue letters of credit such as financial standby performance standby and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party in a borrowing arrangement commercial letters of credit are shortterm commitments issued primarily to facilitate trade finance activities for customers and are generally collateralized by the goods being shipped to the customer these collateral requirements are similar to those for funded transactions and are established based on managements credit assessment of the customer management conducts regular reviews of all outstanding letters of credit and the
