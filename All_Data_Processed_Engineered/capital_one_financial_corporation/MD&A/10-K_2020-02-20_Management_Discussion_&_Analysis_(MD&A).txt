statements in this annual report on s the value of collateral underlying secured loans account seasoning changes in our credit evaluation underwriting and collection management policies seasonality credit bureau scores general economic conditions changes in the legal and regulatory environment and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance for loan and lease losses key factors that have a significant impact on our allowance for loan and lease losses include assumptions about employment levels home prices and the valuation of commercial properties automobiles and other collateral we have a governance framework intended to ensure that our estimate of the allowance for loan and lease losses is appropriate our governance framework provides for oversight of methods models qualitative adjustments process controls and results at least quarterly representatives from the finance and risk management organizations review and assess our allowance methodologies key assumptions and the appropriateness of the allowance for loan and lease losses groups independent of our estimation functions participate in the review and validation process tasks performed by these groups include periodic review of the rationale for and quantification of judgmental inputs and adjustments to results we have a model policy established by an independent model risk office which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for estimating credit losses the model risk office validates all models and requires ongoing monitoring of their performance in addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses we review and assess our estimate of probable losses related to contractually binding unfunded lending commitments on a quarterly basis the factors impacting our assessment generally align with those considered in our evaluation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial banking business changes to the reserve for losses on unfunded lending commitments are recorded through the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income and to other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets although we examine a variety of externally available data as well as our internal loan performance data to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance accordingly our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations we provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses for each of our loan portfolio segments in note 1summary of significant accounting policies we provide information on the components of our allowance disaggregated by impairment methodology and changes in our allowance in note 4allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments finance charge and fee reserves finance charges and fees on credit card loans are recorded in revenue when earned billed finance charges and fees on credit card loans are included in loans held for investment net of amounts that we consider uncollectible unbilled finance charges and fees on credit card loans are included in interest receivable we continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is chargedoff when we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees we reduce the balance of our credit card loan receivables and revenue by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected total net revenue was reduced by billion billion and billion in and respectively for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees the finance charge and fee reserve totaled million and million as of december and respectively table start capital one financial corporation cof table end we review and assess the adequacy of the uncollectible finance charge and fee reserve on a quarterly basis our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for incurred losses on the principal portion of our credit card loan receivables asset impairment in addition to our loan portfolio we review other assets for impairment on a regular basis in accordance with applicable accounting guidance this process requires significant management judgment and involves various estimates and assumptions below we describe our process for assessing impairment of goodwill and the key estimates and assumptions involved in this process goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred in a business combination plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date goodwill totaled billion and billion as of december and respectively we did not recognize any goodwill impairment in and see note 6goodwill and intangible assets for additional information we perform our goodwill impairment test annually on october at a reporting unit level we also are required to test goodwill for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate it is morelikelythannot that an impairment may have occurred we have four reporting units credit card auto other consumer banking and commercial banking the goodwill impairment test is a twostep process the first step involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill if the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount management must estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities of that reporting units balance sheet based on applicable accounting guidance in order to measure the impairment for the purpose of our goodwill impairment testing we calculate the carrying amount of a reporting unit using an allocated capital approach based on each reporting units specific regulatory capital requirements economic capital requirements and underlying risks the carrying amount for a reporting unit is the sum of its respective capital requirements goodwill and intangibles balances we then compare the carrying amount to our total consolidated stockholders equity to assess the reasonableness of our methodology the total carrying amount of our four reporting units was billion as compared to consolidated stockholders equity of billion as of october the billion excess in consolidated stockholders equity was primarily attributable to capital allocated to our other category and other future capital needs such as dividends share buybacks or other strategic initiatives determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process that requires the use of estimates and the exercise of significant judgment we calculated the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow dcf calculation a form of the income approach this income approach calculation used projected cash flows based on each reporting units internal forecast and the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values our dcf analysis required management to make estimates about future loan deposit and revenue growth as well as credit losses and capital rates these cash flows and terminal values were then discounted using discount rates based on our external cost of capital with adjustments for the risk inherent in each reporting unit the reasonableness of the dcf approach was assessed by reference to a marketbased approach using comparable market multiples and recent market transactions where available the results of the annual impairment test for the credit card auto other consumer banking and commercial banking reporting units indicated that the estimated fair values of these four reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts assumptions used in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit are judgmental and inherently uncertain a significant change in the economic conditions of a reporting unit such as declines in business performance increases in credit losses increases in capital requirements deterioration of market conditions adverse impacts of regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated cost of capital could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting units to decline in the future and increase the risk of a goodwill impairment in a future period fair value fair value also referred to as an exit price is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date the fair value accounting guidance provides a table start capital one financial corporation cof table end threelevel fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments this hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable the fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level valuation is based on quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level valuation is based on observable marketbased inputs other than level prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market valuation techniques include pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices in active markets or observable market parameters when quoted prices and observable data in active markets are not fully available management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value changes in market conditions such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value we have developed policies and procedures to determine when markets for our financial assets and liabilities are inactive if the level and volume of activity has declined significantly relative to normal conditions if markets are determined to be inactive it may be appropriate to adjust price quotes received when significant adjustments are required to price quotes or inputs it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain financial instruments measured at fair value are classified as level or level in making this determination we consider all available information that market participants use to measure the fair value of the financial instrument including observable market data indications of market liquidity and orderliness and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category judgments are made regarding the significance of the level inputs to the instruments fair value measurement in its entirety if level inputs are considered significant the instrument is classified as level the process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions we discuss changes in the valuation inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our financial instruments including the extent to which we have relied on significant unobservable inputs to estimate fair value and our process for corroborating these inputs in note 16fair value measurement we have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types price verification and review of valuation judgments methods models process controls and results groups independent of our trading and investing functions participate in the review and validation process tasks performed by these groups include periodic verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable including comparing prices from vendor pricing services to other available market information our fair value committee fvc which includes representation from business areas risk management and finance provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment the fvc regularly reviews and approves our fair valuations to ensure that our valuation practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance we have a model policy established by an independent model risk office which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing and fair value measurements the model risk office validates all models and requires ongoing monitoring of their performance the fair value governance process is set up in a manner that allows the chairperson of the fvc to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved by the fvc to a more senior committee called the valuations advisory committee vac for resolution the vac is chaired by the chief financial officer and includes other members of senior management the vac convenes to review escalated valuation disputes table

activity that can be redeemed for cash primarily in the form of statement credits gift cards travel or coverage of eligible charges the amount of rewards that a customer earns varies based on the terms and conditions of the rewards program and product the majority of our rewards do not expire and there is no limit on the amount of rewards an eligible card member can earn customer rewards costs which we generally record as an offset to interchange income are driven by various factors such as card member purchase volume the terms and conditions of the rewards program and rewards redemption

subject to prompt corrective action pca capital regulations the basel iii capital rule includes the basel iii standardized approach and the basel iii advanced approaches we entered parallel run under basel iii advanced approaches on january during which we were required to calculate capital ratios under both the basel iii standardized approach and the basel iii advanced approaches though we used the standardized approach for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements in october the federal banking agencies amended the basel iii capital rule to provide for tailored application of certain capital requirements across different categories of banking institutions tailoring rules as a bank holding company bhc with total consolidated assets of at least billion that does not exceed any of the applicable riskbased thresholds we are a category iii institution under the tailoring rules as such we are no longer subject to the basel iii advanced approaches and certain associated capital requirements such as the requirement to include in regulatory capital certain elements of aoci in july the federal banking agencies finalized certain changes in the basel iii capital rule for institutions not subject to the basel iii advanced approaches including capital one capital simplification rule these changes effective january generally raise the threshold above which institutions subject to the capital simplification rule must deduct certain assets from their common equity tier capital including certain deferred tax assets mortgage servicing assets and investments in unconsolidated financial institutions while the higher thresholds will not impact our current capital levels in stress scenarios they may provide a benefit by enabling us to include more deferred tax assets in our common equity tier capital all else equal we anticipate that the tailoring rules and capital simplification rule will taken together decrease our capital requirements table start capital

united states a determination to increase the countercyclical capital buffer generally would be effective twelve months after the announcement of such an increase unless the federal banking agencies set an earlier effective date the market risk rule requires institutions subject to the rule to adjust their riskbased capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading portfolios as of december the company and cona are subject to the market risk rule see mda market risk profile below for additional information in december the federal banking agencies revised the basel iii capital

framework our risk management framework the framework sets consistent expectations for risk management across the company it also sets expectations for our three lines of defense model which defines the roles responsibilities and accountabilities for taking and managing risk across the company accountability for overseeing an effective framework resides with our board of directors either directly or through its committees the first line of defense consists of any line of business or function that is accountable for risk taking and is responsible for i engaging in activities designed to generate revenue or reduce expenses ii providing operational support or servicing to any business function for the delivery of products or services to customers or iii providing technology services in direct support of first line business areas each line of business or first line function is responsible for managing the risks associated with their activities including identifying assessing measuring monitoring controlling and reporting the risks within its business activities consistent with the risk framework the second line of defense consists of two types of functions independent risk management irm and support functions irm oversees risktaking activities and assesses risks and issues independent from the first line of defense support functions are centers of specialized expertise eg human resources accounting legal that provide support services to the company the third line of defense is comprised of the internal audit and credit review functions the third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the board of directors that the first and second lines of defense have systems and governance processes which are welldesigned and working as intended and that the framework is appropriate for our size complexity and risk profile our framework consists of the following nine elements table start governance and accountability strategy and risk alignment risk identification assessment measurement and response monitoring and testing aggregation reporting and escalation capital and liquidity management including stress testing risk data and enabling technology culture and talent management table end governance and accountability this element of the framework sets the foundation for the methods for governing risk taking and the interactions within and among our three lines of defense we established a risk governance structure and accountabilities to effectively and consistently oversee the management of risks across the company our board of directors chief executive officer and management establish the tone at the top regarding the culture of the company including management of risk management reinforces expectations at the various levels of the organization table start capital one financial corporation cof table end strategy and risk alignment our strategy is informed by and aligned with risk appetite from development to execution the chief executive officer develops the strategy with input from the first second and third lines of defense as well as the board of directors the strategic planning process should consider relevant changes to the companys overall risk profile our board of directors approves a risk appetite statement for the company to set forth the highlevel principles that govern risk taking at the company the risk appetite statement defines the board of directors tolerance for certain risk outcomes at an enterprise level and enables senior management to manage and report within these boundaries this risk appetite statement is also supported by risk category specific risk appetite statements as well as metrics and where appropriate board limits and board notification thresholds risk identification the first line of defense and certain support functions where appropriate are expected to identify new and emerging risks across the relevant risk categories associated with their business activities and objectives in consultation with irm risk identification also must be informed by major changes in infrastructure or organization introduction of new products and services acquisitions of businesses or substantial changes in the internal or external environment irm and certain support functions where appropriate provide effective challenge in the risk identification process irm is also responsible for identifying our material aggregate risks on an ongoing basis assessment measurement and response management is responsible for assessing risks associated with our activities risks identified should be assessed to understand the severity of each risk and likelihood of occurrence under both normal and stressful conditions as appropriate risk severity is measured through modeling and other quantitative estimation approaches as well as qualitative approaches based on management judgment as part of the risk assessment process the first and second lines of defense also evaluate the effectiveness of the existing control environment and mitigation strategies management is responsible for determining the appropriate risk response risks may be mitigated accepted transferred or avoided actions taken to respond to the risk may include implementing new controls enhancing existing controls developing additional mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of the risk andor monitoring the risk monitoring and testing management periodically monitors risks to evaluate and measure how the risk is affecting our strategy and business objectives in alignment with risk appetite the scope and frequency of monitoring activities depends on the results of relevant risk assessments as well as specific business risk operations and activities the first line of defense is responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of risk management practices and controls through testing and other activities irm and support functions as appropriate assess the first line of defenses evaluation of risk management which may include conducting effective challenge performing independent monitoring or conducting risk or control validations the third line of defense provides independent assurance for first and second line risk management practices and controls to provide assurance aggregation reporting and escalation risk aggregation supports strategic decision making and risk management practices through collectively reporting risks across different levels of the company and providing a comprehensive view of performance against

material risks are reported to the board of directors and senior management committees no less than quarterly capital and liquidity management including stress testing our capital management processes are linked to its risk management practices including the enterprisewide identification assessment and measurement of risks to ensure that all relevant risks are incorporated in the assessment of the companys capital table start capital one financial corporation cof table end adequacy we use identified risks to inform key aspects of the companys capital planning including the development of stress scenarios the assessment of the adequacy of poststress capital levels and the appropriateness of potential capital actions considering the companys capital objectives we quantify capital needs through stress testing regulatory capital economic capital and assessments of market considerations in assessing its capital adequacy we identify how and where our material risks are accounted for within the capital planning process monitoring and escalation processes exist for key capital thresholds and metrics to continuously monitor capital adequacy risk data and enabling technology risk data and technology provides the basis for risk reporting and is used in decision making and to monitor and review changes to our risk profile there is a core governance risk management and compliance system which is used as the system of record for risks controls issues and events for our risk categories and supports the analysis aggregation and reporting capabilities across the categories culture and talent management the framework must be supported with the right culture talent and skills to enable effective risk management across the company every associate at the company is responsible for risk management however associates with specific risk management skills and expertise within the first second and third lines of defense are critical to ensure appropriate risk management across the enterprise risk categories we apply our framework to protect the company from the eight major categories of risk that we are exposed to through our business activities our eight major categories of risk are table start major categories of risk compliance the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws rules or regulations compliance risk can also arise from nonconformance with prescribed practices internal policies and procedures contractual obligations or ethical standards that reinforce those laws rules or regulations credit the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from an obligors failure to meet the terms of any contract with the company or otherwise perform as agreed legal the risk of material adverse impact due to new and changed laws and regulations interpretations of law drafting interpretation and enforceability of contracts adverse decisions or consequences arising from litigation or regulatory actions the establishment management and governance of the legal entity structure and the failure to seek or follow appropriate legal counsel when needed liquidity the risk that the company will not be able to meet its future financial obligations as they come due or invest in future asset growth because of an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time market the risk that an institutions earnings or the economic value of equity could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates or other market factors operational the risk of loss capital impairment adverse customer experience or reputational impact resulting from failure to comply with policies and procedures failed internal processes or systems or from external events reputation the risk to market value recruitment and retention of talented associates and maintenance of a loyal customer base due to the negative perceptions of our internal and external constituents regarding our business strategies and activities strategic the risk of a material impact on current or anticipated earnings capital franchise or enterprise value arising from the companys competitive and market position and evolving forces in the industry that can affect that position lack of responsiveness to these conditions strategic decisions to change the companys scale market position or operating model or failure to appropriately consider implementation risks inherent in the companys strategy table end table start capital one financial corporation cof table end we provide an overview of how we manage our eight major categories of risk below compliance risk management we recognize that compliance requirements for financial institutions are increasingly complex and that there are heightened expectations from our regulators and our customers in response we continuously evaluate the regulatory environment and proactively adjust our compliance program to fully address these expectations our compliance management program establishes expectations for determining compliance requirements assessing the risk of new product offerings creating appropriate controls and training to address requirements monitoring for control performance and independently testing for adherence to compliance requirements the program also establishes regular compliance reporting to senior business leaders the executive committee and the board of directors the chief compliance officer is responsible for establishing and overseeing our compliance management program business areas incorporate compliance requirements and controls into their business policies standards processes and procedures they regularly monitor and report on the efficacy of their compliance controls and our corporate compliance team periodically independently tests to validate the effectiveness of business controls credit risk management we recognize that we are exposed to cyclical changes in credit quality consequently we try to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns our most important tool in this endeavor is sound underwriting in unsecured consumer loan underwriting we generally assume that loans will be subject to an environment in which losses are higher than those prevailing at the time of underwriting in commercial underwriting we generally require strong cash flow collateral covenants and guarantees in addition to sound underwriting we continually monitor our portfolio and take steps to collect or work out distressed loans the chief risk officer in conjunction with the consumer and commercial chief credit officers is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures including underwriting and hold guidelines and credit approval authority and monitoring credit exposure and performance of our lending related transactions our consumer and commercial chief credit officers are responsible for evaluating the risk implications of credit strategy and the oversight of credit for both the existing portfolio and any new credit investments they also have formal approval authority for various types and levels of credit decisions including individual commercial loan transactions division presidents within each segment are responsible for managing the credit risk within their divisions and maintaining processes to control credit risk and comply with credit policies and guidelines in addition the chief risk officer establishes policies delegates approval authority and monitors performance for nonloan credit exposure entered into with financial counterparties or through the purchase of credit sensitive securities in our investment portfolio our credit policies establish standards in five areas customer selection underwriting monitoring remediation and portfolio management the standards in each area provide a framework comprising specific objectives and control processes these standards are supported by

market risk is the risk of economic loss in the value of our financial instruments due to changes in market factors our primary market risk exposures include interest rate risk foreign exchange risk

endtable start assetliability management activities including the management of investment securities shortterm and longterm borrowings and derivatives table endtable start foreign operations in the uk and canada within our credit card business and table endtable start customer accommodation activities within our commercial banking business table end we have enterprisewide risk management policies and limits approved by our board of directors which govern our market risk management activities our objective is to manage our exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and limits based on prevailing market conditions and longterm expectations we provide additional information below about our primary sources of market risk our market risk management strategies and the measures that we use to evaluate these exposures interest rate risk interest rate risk represents exposure to financial instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the differences in the timing between the maturities or repricing of assets and liabilities we manage our interest rate risk primarily by entering into interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments including caps floors options futures and forward contracts we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and changes in foreign exchange rates on our nondollardenominated funding and nondollar equity investments in foreign operations table start capital one financial corporation cof table end net interest income sensitivity our net interest income sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12month baseline interest ratesensitive revenue resulting from movements in interest rates interest ratesensitive revenue consists of net interest income and certain components of other noninterest income significantly impacted by movements in interest rates including changes in the fair value of freestanding interest rate derivatives in addition to our existing assets and liabilities we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected interest ratesensitive revenue we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates detailed in table below at the current level of interest rates our interest rate sensitive revenue is expected to increase modestly in higher rate scenarios and decrease modestly in lower rate scenarios economic value of equity our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities including derivative exposures resulting from movements in interest rates our economic value of equity sensitivity measure is calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities including derivatives and does not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected balance sheet changes key assumptions used in the calculation include projecting rate sensitive prepayments for mortgage securities loans and other assets term structure modeling of interest rates discount spreads and deposit volume and pricing assumptions in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates detailed in table below our current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity generally decreases as interest rates decrease from the current levels table shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected baseline net interest income and economic value of equity calculated

rate sensitivity analysis table start december december estimated impact on projected baseline net interest income basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points estimated impact on economic value of equity basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points table end in addition to these industry standard measures we also consider the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios in our internal interest rate risk management decisions limitations of market risk measures the interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information internallydeveloped assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments other market inputs such as interest rates market prices and interest rate volatility are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures we regularly evaluate update and enhance these assumptions models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities table start capital one financial corporation cof table end there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates the sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and in some cases expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions the strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis for further information on our interest rate exposures see note 9derivative instruments and hedging activities foreign exchange risk foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies we are exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily from the intercompany funding denominated in the pound sterling gbp and the canadian dollar cad that we provide to our businesses in the uk and canada and net equity investments in those businesses we are also exposed to foreign exchange risk due to changes in the dollardenominated value of future earnings and cash flows from our foreign operations and from our euro eurdenominated borrowings our nondollar denominated intercompany funding and eurdenominated borrowings expose our earnings to foreign exchange transaction risk we manage these transaction risks by using forward foreign currency derivatives and crosscurrency swaps to hedge our exposures we measure our foreign exchange transaction risk exposures by applying a us dollar appreciation shock against the value of the nondollar denominated intercompany funding and eurdenominated borrowings and their related hedges which shows the impact to our earnings from foreign exchange risk our intercompany funding outstanding was million gbp and million gbp as of december and respectively and billion cad and billion cad as of december and respectively our eurdenominated borrowings outstanding were billion eur as of december our nondollar equity investments in foreign operations expose our balance sheet to translation risk in aoci and our capital ratios we manage our aoci exposure by entering into foreign currency derivatives designated as net investment hedges we measure these exposures by applying a us dollar appreciation shock which we believe approximates a significant adverse shock over a oneyear time horizon against the value of the net equity invested in our foreign operations related net investment hedges where applicable our gross equity exposures in our uk and canadian operations were billion gbp as of both december and and billion cad and billion cad as of december and respectively as a result of our derivative management activities we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal risk related to customer accommodation derivatives we offer interest rate commodity and foreign currency derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our commercial banking business we offset the majority of the market risk of these customer accommodation derivatives by entering into offsetting derivatives transactions with other counterparties we use valueatrisk var as the primary method to measure the market risk in our customer accommodation derivative activities on a daily basis var is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from movements observed in the recent market environment we employ an historical simulation approach using the most recent business days and use a percent confidence level and a holding period of one business day as a result of offsetting our customer exposures with other counterparties we believe that our net exposure to market risk in our customer accommodation derivatives is minimal for further information on our risk related to customer accommodation derivatives see note 9derivative instruments and
