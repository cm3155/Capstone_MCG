reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment our business segment results are intended to reflect each capital one financial corporation cof segment as if it were a standalone

process which is primarily based on a matched funding concept that takes into consideration market interest rates our funds transfer pricing process is managed by our centralized corporate treasury group and provides a funds credit for sources of funds such as deposits generated by our consumer banking and commercial banking businesses and a charge for the use of funds by each segment the allocation is unique to each business segment and acquired business and is based on the composition of assets and liabilities the funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and offbalance sheet products periodically the methodology and assumptions utilized in the funds transfer pricing process are adjusted to

exposed to market risk primarily from the following operations and activities traditional banking activities of deposit gathering and lending assetliability management activities including the management of investment securities shortterm and longterm borrowings and derivatives foreign operations in the uk and canada within our credit card business and customer accommodation activities within our commercial banking business we have enterprisewide risk management policies and limits approved by our board of directors which govern our market risk management activities our objective is to manage our exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and limits based on prevailing market conditions and longterm expectations we provide additional information below about our primary sources of market risk our market risk management strategies and the measures that we use to evaluate these exposures interest rate risk interest rate risk represents exposure to financial instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the differences in the timing between the maturities or repricing of assets and liabilities our balance sheet is structurally asset sensitive as our loans which are primarily floating rate or fixed rate with short durations reprice faster than our fixed rate debt and a portion of our deposits when interest rates change we take actions to reduce the interest rate risk from this structural balance sheet position primarily by investing in fixed rate securities in our capital one financial corporation cof investment portfolio and executing interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and changes in foreign exchange rates on our nondollardenominated funding and nondollar equity investments in foreign operations net interest income sensitivity our net interest income sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12month baseline net interest income resulting from movements in interest rates in addition to our existing assets and liabilities we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast we also incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit repricing which includes pricing lags and changes in deposit beta and mix as interest rates change and the prepayment sensitivity of our mortgage securities to the level of interest rates in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected net interest income we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates detailed in table below at the current level of interest rates our net interest income is expected to increase in higher rate scenarios and decrease in lower rate scenarios our current sensitivity to both upward and downward shocks has increased modestly as compared to december primarily due to the increase in cash balances driven by the growth in our deposit balances cash balances reprice relatively rapidly whereas deposit rates reprice less with both lag and beta effects in the contexts used in this section beta refers to the percentage of deposit rate repricing relative to an external reference rate such as federal funds in our models deposit betas vary dynamically and by product type economic value of equity sensitivity our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities including derivative exposures resulting from movements in interest rates our economic value of equity sensitivity measure is calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities including derivatives and does not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected balance sheet changes similar to our net interest income sensitivity measure we incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit repricing and attrition which includes pricing lags and changes in deposit beta as interest rates change and the prepayment sensitivity of our mortgage securities to the level of interest rates other key assumptions used in the calculation include attrition assumptions for loans and other assets term structure modeling of interest rates and discount spreads in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates detailed in table below our current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity decreases in higher interest rate scenarios and is largely unchanged in l ower interest rate scenarios the decrease in higher rate scenarios is due to the declines in the projected value of our fixed rate assets being only partially offset by corresponding movements in the projected value of our deposits and other liabilities the pace of economic value of equity decrease is larger for the bps scenario as our deposits are assumed to reprice more rapidly in higher interest rate environments our current economic value of equity sensitivity is largely unchanged as compared to december capital one financial corporation cof table shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected baseline net interest income and our current economic value of equity calculated under the methodology described above as of march and december in instances where an interest rate scenario would result in a rate less than we assume a rate of for

points estimated impact on economic value of equity basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points in addition to these industry standard measures we consider the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios in our internal interest rate risk management decisions we also regularly review the sensitivity of our interest rate risk metrics to changes in our key modeling assumptions such as our loan and deposit balance forecasts mortgage prepayments and deposit repricing limitations of market risk measures the interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information internallydeveloped assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments other market inputs such as interest rates market prices and interest rate volatility are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures we regularly evaluate update and enhance these assumptions models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates the sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on our existing balance sheet and in some cases expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions the strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis for further information on our interest rate

foreign exchange risk due to changes in the dollardenominated value of future earnings and cash flows from our foreign operations and from our euro eurdenominated borrowings our nondollar denominated intercompany funding and eurdenominated borrowings expose our earnings to foreign exchange transaction risk we manage these transaction risks by using forward foreign currency derivatives and crosscurrency swaps to hedge our exposures we measure our foreign exchange transaction risk exposures by applying a us dollar appreciation shock against the value of the nondollar denominated intercompany funding and eurdenominated borrowings and their related hedges which shows the impact to our earnings from foreign exchange risk our nominal intercompany funding outstanding was million gbp and million gbp as of march and december respectively and billion cad and billion cad as of march and december respectively our nominal eurdenominated borrowings outstanding were billion eur as of both march and december our nondollar equity investments in foreign operations expose our balance sheet to translation risk in aoci and our capital ratios we manage our aoci exposure by entering into

operations were billion gbp as of both march and december and billion cad and billion cad as of march and december respectively as a result of our derivative management activities we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal risk related to customer accommodation derivatives we offer interest rate commodity and foreign currency derivatives as an accommodation to our customers

counterparties we use valueatrisk var as the primary method to measure the market risk in our customer accommodation derivative activities on a daily basis var is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from movements observed in the recent market environment we employ a historical simulation approach using the most recent business days and use a percent confidence level
