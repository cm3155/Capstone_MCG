be affected by factors events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations in addition the global economic and political climate may amplify many of these risks summary of risk factors the following is a summary of the risk factors disclosure in this item this summary does not address all of the risks that we face additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary and other risks that we face can be found below and should be carefully considered together with other information in this s with the sec before making an investment decision regarding our securities the transaction is contingent upon a number of conditions including stockholder and regulatory approvals which may fail to be satisfied or which may delay the consummation of the transaction or result in the imposition of conditions that could reduce the anticipated benefits from the transaction or cause the parties to abandon the transaction we are expected to incur substantial expenses related to the transaction and to the integration of discover we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction or those benefits may take longer or be more difficult to realize than expected our future results may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the transaction we will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the transaction is pending changes and instability in the macroeconomic environment could disrupt capital markets reduce consumer and business activity and weaken the labor market all of which could impact borrowers ability to service their debt obligations and adversely impact our financial results fluctuations in interest rates or volatility in the capital markets could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition we may experience increases or fluctuations in delinquencies and credit losses or we may incorrectly estimate expected losses which could result in inadequate reserves we may not be able to maintain adequate capital or liquidity levels or may become subject to revised capital or liquidity requirements which could have a negative impact on our financial results and our ability to return capital to our stockholders limitations on our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock a downgrade in our credit ratings could significantly impact our liquidity funding costs and access to the capital markets we face risks related to our operational technological and organizational infrastructure a cyberattack or other security incident on us or third parties including their supply chains with which we conduct business including an incident that results in the theft loss manipulation or misuse of information including personal information or the disabling of systems and access to information critical to business operations may result in increased costs reductions in revenue reputational damage legal exposure and business disruptions we face risks resulting from the extensive use of models ai and data table start capital one financial corporation cof table end compliance with new and existing domestic and foreign laws regulations and regulatory expectations is costly and complex our required compliance with applicable laws and regulations related to privacy data protection and data security in addition to compliance with our own privacy policies and contractual obligations to third parties may increase our costs reduce our revenue increase our legal exposure and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities our businesses are subject to the risk of increased litigation government investigations and regulatory enforcement we face intense competition in all of our markets which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by merchants efforts to reduce the fees charged by credit and debit card networks to facilitate card transactions and by legislation and regulation impacting such fees if we are not able to invest successfully in and introduce digital and other technological developments across all our businesses our financial performance may suffer we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our mergers acquisitions and strategic partnerships reputational risk and social factors may impact our results and damage our brand if we are not able to protect our intellectual property our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected our risk management strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all market environments or against all types of risk our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to attract develop retain and motivate key senior leaders and skilled employees we face risks from catastrophic events climate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could adversely affect our businesses operations and customers and result in increased costs we face risks from the use of or changes to assumptions or estimates in our financial statements the soundness of other financial institutions and other third parties actual or perceived could adversely affect us risks relating to the acquisition of discover we have identified certain additional risk factors in connection with the merger agreement and the proposed transaction these risks and the other risks associated with the proposed transaction will be more fully discussed in the joint proxy statementprospectus that will be included in the registration statement on form s4 that we intend to file with the sec in connection with the transaction the consummation of the transaction is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions including stockholder and regulatory approvals that may be outside either partys control and that either party may be unable to satisfy or obtain or which may delay the consummation of the transaction or result in the imposition of conditions that could reduce the anticipated benefits from the transaction or cause the parties to abandon the transaction consummation of the transaction is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions some of which are beyond either partys control including among others adoption of the merger agreement by discovers stockholders approval by our stockholders of the issuance of our common stock to be issued in the transaction authorization for listing on the nyse of the shares of our common stock to be issued in the transaction table start capital one financial corporation cof table end the receipt of required regulatory approvals effectiveness of the registration statement on form s4 to be filed by us in connection with the transaction and the absence of any order injunction decree or other legal restraint preventing the completion of the transaction each partys obligation to complete the transaction is also subject to certain additional customary conditions including subject to certain exceptions the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the merger agreement and receipt by such party of an opinion from its counsel to the effect that the merger and the second step merger taken together will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the internal revenue code of as amended these conditions to the closing of the transaction may not be fulfilled in a

requisite approvals by our stockholders or discovers stockholders or either party may elect to terminate the merger agreement in certain other circumstances as a condition to granting required regulatory approvals governmental entities may impose conditions limitations or costs require divestitures or place restrictions on our conduct after the closing of the transaction such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could among other things have the effect of delaying completion of the transaction or of imposing additional costs or limitations on us following the transaction any of which may have an adverse effect on us either party may also be subject to lawsuits challenging the transaction and adverse rulings in these lawsuits may delay or prevent the transaction from being completed or require either party to incur significant costs to defend or settle these lawsuits any delay in completing the transaction could cause us not to realize or to be delayed in realizing some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the transaction is successfully completed within its expected time frame we expect to incur substantial expenses related to the transaction and to the integration of discover we have incurred and expect to incur a number of costs associated with the transaction and the integration of discover these costs include financial advisory legal accounting consulting and other advisory fees severanceemployee benefitrelated costs public company filing fees and other regulatory fees and financial printing and other related costs there are also a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems that may need to be integrated while we have assumed that a certain level of costs will be incurred there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses moreover many of the expenses that we will incur are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately these expenses could particularly in the near term exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale these integration expenses may result in us taking charges against earnings as a result of the transaction or the integration of discover and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected due to factors that may be outside our control or discovers control we may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating discover we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction including among other things anticipated revenue and cost synergies due to factors that may be outside either partys control including but not limited to changes in laws or regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations whether caused by a change in government or otherwise or general economic political legislative or regulatory conditions and the outcome of any legal or regulatory proceedings that may be currently pending or later instituted against us before or after the transaction or against discover both parties have operated and until the completion of the transaction will continue to operate independently the success of the transaction including anticipated benefits and cost savings will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate discovers operations in a manner that results in various benefits and that does not materially disrupt existing customer relationships or result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers as well as our ability to successfully integrate discover table start capital one financial corporation cof table end into our framework compliance systems and corporate culture the process of integrating operations could result in a loss of key personnel or cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of one or more of our businesses following the completion of the transaction inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies could adversely affect us following the completion of the transaction the diversion of managements attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the transaction and the integration of discovers operations could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition operating results and prospects if we experience difficulties in the integration process including those listed above we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction in a timely manner or at all our future results may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the transaction following the transaction the size and scope of our business will increase significantly beyond our current size and scope our future success depends in part upon the ability to manage our expanded businesses which will pose substantial challenges for management including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity there can be no assurances we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the transaction in addition following the transaction we may be subject to increased scrutiny by andor additional regulatory requirements of governmental authorities as a result of the transaction or the size scope and complexity of our business operations which may have an adverse effect on our business operations or stock price while the transaction is pending we will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could adversely affect our business and operations uncertainty about the effect of the transaction on employees customers suppliers and other persons with whom we or discover have a business relationship may have an adverse effect on our business operations and stock price existing customers suppliers and other business partners of ours and of discover could decide to no longer do business with us or with discover before the completion of the transaction or with us after the transaction is completed reducing its anticipated benefits both parties are also subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our respective businesses while the transaction is pending as a result certain projects may be delayed or abandoned and business decisions could be deferred employee retention may be challenging for discover before completion of the transaction as certain employees of discover may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us following the transaction and these retention challenges will require us to incur additional expenses in order to retain key employees of discover if key employees of discover depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with discover or with us following the transaction the benefits of the transaction could be materially diminished general economic and market risks changes and instability in the macroeconomic environment could disrupt capital markets reduce consumer and business activity and weaken the labor market all of which could impact borrowers ability to service their debt obligations and adversely impact our financial results changes and instability in the macroeconomic environment may lead to changes in payment patterns increases or fluctuations in delinquencies and default rates and decrease consumer spending because we offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers small businesses and commercial clients our financial results are impacted by the level of consumer and business activity and the demand for our products and services a prolonged period of economic weakness volatility slow growth or a significant deterioration in economic conditions in the us canada or the uk could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as customers or commercial clients default on their loans maintain lower deposit levels or in the case of credit card accounts carry lower balances and reduce credit card purchase activity some of the factors that could disrupt capital markets reduce consumer and business activity and weaken the labor market include the following monetary policy actions such as changes to interest rates taken by the federal reserve and other central banks such as the central banks in the united kingdom and canada geopolitical conflicts or instabilities such as the war between ukraine and russia and the war between israel and hamas and increased geopolitical tensions between the us and china table start capital one financial corporation cof table end trade wars tariffs labor shortages and disruptions of global supply chains the effects of divided government in the us including government shutdowns whether recurring prolonged or otherwise and developments related to the us federal debt ceiling inflation and deflation including the effects of related governmental responses concerns over a potential recession which may lead to adjustments in spending patterns lower demand for credit and shifts in consumer behavior including shifts away from using credit cards changes in deposit practices and changes in and payment patterns and ongoing changes in usage of commercial real estate which may have a sustained negative impact on utilization rates and values decreases in overall business activity and changes in customer behavior may lead to increases in our chargeoff rate caused by bankruptcies and may reduce our ability to recover debt that we have previously chargedoff such changes may also decrease the reliability of our internal processes and models including those we use to estimate our allowance for credit losses particularly if unexpected variations in key inputs and assumptions cause actual losses to diverge from the projections of our models and our estimates become increasingly subject to managements judgment see we face risks resulting from the extensive use of models ai and data fluctuations in interest rates or volatility in the capital markets could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition like other financial institutions our business is sensitive to interest rate movements and the performance of the capital markets we rely on access to the capital markets to fund our operations and to grow our business our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in funding transactions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions uncertainty or volatility in the capital markets additionally increased chargeoffs rising interest rates increased refinancing activity and other events may cause our securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled or reduce the value of the securities that we hold for liquidity purposes which could accelerate our need for additional funding from other sources we could also experience impairments of other financial assets and other negative impacts on our financial position including possible constraints on liquidity and capital as well as higher costs of capital additionally changes in interest rates could adversely affect the results of our operations and financial condition for example if inflation were to remain elevated or begin to increase interest rates could increase further higher interest rates increase our borrowing costs and may require us to increase the interest we pay on funds deposited with us and may reduce the market value of our securities holdings if interest rates continue to increase or if higher interest rates persist for an extended period of time our expenses may increase further if the rate of economic growth decreased sharply causing the federal reserve to lower interest rates our net income could be adversely affected additionally a shrinking yield premium between shortterm and longterm market interest rates could adversely impact the rates that we pay on our liabilities and the rates that we earn on our assets and thus affect our profitability we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our earnings economic value and capital under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction and the magnitude of interest rate changes we take risk mitigation actions based on those assessments we face the risk that changes in interest rates could materially reduce our net interest income and our earnings especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than those we assumed furthermore interest rate fluctuations and competitor responses to those changes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as customers or commercial clients default on their loans maintain lower deposit levels or in the case of credit card accounts reduce demand for credit or for existing customers the level of borrowing or purchase activity for example increases in interest rates increase debt service requirements for some of our borrowers which may adversely affect those borrowers ability to pay as contractually obligated this could result in additional or fluctuating delinquencies or chargeoffs and negatively impact our results of operations these changes could reduce the overall yield on our interestearning asset portfolio an inability to attract or maintain deposits could materially affect our ability to fund our business and our liquidity position many other financial institutions have increased their reliance on deposit funding and as such we expect continued competition in the deposit markets we cannot predict how this competition will affect our costs if we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits our funding costs will be adversely impacted table start capital one financial corporation cof table end changes in valuations in the debt and equity markets could have a negative impact on the assets we hold in our investment portfolio such market changes could also have a negative impact on the valuation of assets for which we provide servicing see part iiitem mdamarket risk profile and we face intense competition in all of our markets for additional information credit risk we may experience increases or fluctuations in delinquencies and credit losses or we may incorrectly estimate expected losses which could result in inadequate reserves like other lenders we face the risk that our customers will not repay their loans a customers ability and willingness to repay us can be adversely affected by decreases in the income of the borrower or increases in their payment obligations to other lenders whether as a result of a job loss higher debt levels or rising cost of servicing debt inflation outpacing wage growth or by restricted availability of credit generally we may fail to quickly identify and reduce our exposure to customers that are likely to default on their payment obligations whether by closing credit lines or restricting authorizations our ability to manage credit risk also is affected by legal or regulatory changes such as restrictions on collections bankruptcy laws minimum payment regulations and reage guidance competitors actions and consumer behavior and depends on the effectiveness of our collections staff techniques and models rising credit losses or leading indicators of rising credit losses such as higher delinquencies higher rates of nonperforming loans higher bankruptcy rates lower collateral values elevated unemployment rates or changing market terms may require us to increase our allowance for credit losses which would decrease our profitability if we are unable to raise revenue or reduce costs to compensate for higher credit losses whether actual or expected in particular we face the following risks in this area missed payments our customers may fail to make required payments on time and may default or become delinquent loan chargeoffs including from bankruptcies are generally preceded by missed payments or other indications of worsening financial conditions for our customers historically customers are more likely to miss payments during an economic downturn recession periods of high unemployment or prolonged periods of slow economic growth customers might also be more likely to miss payments if the payment burdens on their existing debt grow due to rising interest rates or if inflation outpaces wage growth additionally the cfpb has among other things proposed changes to lower the safe harbor amount for past due fees that a credit card issuer can charge on consumer credit card accounts which could result in changes in consumer repayment patterns incorrect estimates of expected credit losses the credit quality of our loan portfolios can have a significant impact on our earnings we allow for and reserve against credit risks based on our assessment of expected credit losses in our loan portfolios this process which is critical to our financial condition and results of operations requires complex judgments including forecasts of economic conditions we may underestimate our expected credit losses and fail to hold an allowance for credit losses sufficient to account for these credit losses incorrect assumptions could lead to material underestimations of expected credit losses and an inadequate allowance for credit losses see we face risks resulting from the extensive use of models ai and data inaccurate underwriting our ability to accurately assess the creditworthiness of our customers may diminish which could result in an increase in our credit losses and a deterioration of our returns see our risk management strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all market environments or against all types of risk business mix we engage in a diverse mix of businesses with a broad range of potential credit exposure because we originate a relatively greater proportion of consumer loans in our loan portfolio compared to other large bank peers and originate both prime and subprime credit card accounts and auto loans we may experience higher delinquencies and a greater number of accounts charging off as well as greater fluctuations in those metrics compared to other large bank peers which could result in increased credit losses operating costs and regulatory scrutiny additionally a change in this business mix over time to include proportionally more consumer loans or subprime credit card accounts or auto loans could adversely affect the credit quality of our loan portfolios table start capital one financial corporation cof table end increasing chargeoff recognitionallowance for credit losses we account for the allowance for credit losses according to accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules including financial accounting standards board fasb standards and the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec account management guidance we measure our allowance for credit losses under the cecl standard which is based on managements best estimate of expected lifetime credit losses the impact of measuring our allowance for credit losses on our results will depend on the characteristics of our financial instruments economic conditions and our economic and loss forecasts the application of the cecl standard may require us to increase reserves faster and to a higher level in an economic downturn resulting in greater adverse impact to our results and our capital ratios than we would have experienced in similar circumstances prior to the adoption of cecl due to our business mix and the impact of credit losses on our income statement as compared to many of our large bank peers we could be disproportionately affected by use of the cecl standard insufficient asset values the collateral we have on secured loans could be insufficient to compensate us for credit losses when customers default on their secured loans we attempt to recover collateral where permissible and appropriate however the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from our customers decreases in real estate and other asset values adversely affect the collateral value for our commercial lending activities while the auto business is similarly exposed to collateral risks arising from the auction markets that determine used car prices borrowers may be less likely to continue making payments on loans if the value of the property used as collateral for the loan is less than what the borrower owes even if the borrower is still financially able to make the payments in that circumstance the recovery of such property could be insufficient to compensate us for the value of these loans upon a default in our auto business business and economic conditions that negatively affect household incomes and savings housing prices and consumer behavior as well as technological advances that make older cars obsolete faster could decrease i the demand for new andor used vehicles and ii the value of the collateral underlying our portfolio of auto loans which could cause the number of consumers who become delinquent or default on their loans to increase geographic and industry concentration although our consumer lending is geographically diversified approximately of our commercial real estate loan portfolio is concentrated in the northeast region the regional economic conditions in the northeast affect the demand for our commercial products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay their commercial real estate loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans an economic downturn or prolonged period of slow economic growth in or a catastrophic event or natural disaster that disproportionately affects the northeast region could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our commercial real estate loan portfolio and our results of operations in addition our commercial banking strategy includes an industryspecific focus if any of the industries that we focus on experience changes we may experience increased credit losses and our results of operations could be adversely impacted capital and liquidity risk we may not be able to maintain adequate capital or liquidity levels or may become subject to revised capital or liquidity requirements which could have a negative impact on our financial results and our ability to return capital to our stockholders financial institutions are subject to extensive and complex capital and liquidity requirements which are subject to change these requirements affect our ability to lend grow deposit balances make acquisitions and distribute capital failure to maintain adequate capital or liquidity levels whether due to adverse developments in our business or the economy or to changes in the applicable requirements could subject us to a variety of restrictions andor remedial actions imposed by our regulators these include limitations on the ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares and the issuance of a capital directive to increase capital such limitations or capital directive could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for example changes to applicable capital liquidity or other regulations such as the changes proposed in the basel iii finalization proposal and the ltd proposal could result in increased regulatory capital requirements operating expenses or cost of funding which could negatively affect our financial results or our ability to distribute capital we consider various factors in the management of capital including the impact of both internal and supervisory stress scenarios on our capital levels as determined by our internal modeling and the federal reserves estimation of losses in supervisory stress scenarios that are used to annually set our stress capital buffer requirement there can be significant differences between our modeling and the federal reserves projections for a given supervisory stress scenario and between the capital needs suggested by our internal stress scenarios and the supervisory scenarios therefore although our estimated capital levels under stress disclosed as part of the stress testing processes may suggest that we have a particular capacity to return capital to stockholders table start capital one financial corporation cof table end and remain well capitalized under stress the federal reserves modeling our internal modeling of another scenario or other factors related to our capital management process may reflect a lower capacity to return capital to stockholders than that indicated by the projections released in the stress testing processes this in turn could lead to restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and engage in repurchases of our common stock see item businesssupervision and regulation for additional information we also consider various factors in the management of liquidity including maintaining sufficient liquid assets to meet the requirements of several internal and regulatory stress tests there can be significant differences in estimated liquidity needs between internal and regulatory stress testing and liquidity resources required to meet regulatory requirements such as applicable lcr and nsfr requirements may exceed what would otherwise be required to satisfy internal liquidity metrics and stress testing regulatory liquidity stress testing and regulatory liquidity requirements may therefore require us to take actions to increase our liquid assets or alter our activities or funding sources which could negatively affect our financial results or our ability to return capital to our stockholders see item businesssupervision and regulation for additional information limitations on our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock we are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries including without limitation the bank and our brokerdealer subsidiaries dividends to us from these direct and indirect subsidiaries have represented a major source of funds for us to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock repurchase our common stock make payments on corporate debt securities and meet other obligations these capital distributions may be limited by law regulation or supervisory policy there are various federal law limitations on the extent to which the bank can finance or otherwise supply funds to us through dividends and loans these limitations include minimum regulatory capital and capital buffer requirements federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus and sections and of the federal reserve act and regulation w governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices our brokerdealer subsidiaries are also subject to laws and regulations including net capital requirements that may limit their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us if our subsidiaries earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels our liquidity may be affected and we may not be able to make dividend payments to our common or preferred stockholders repurchase our common stock make payments on outstanding corporate debt securities or meet other obligations each and any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations our financial position or the perception of our financial health the frequency and size of any future dividends to our stockholders and our stock repurchases will depend upon regulatory limitations imposed by our regulators and our results of operations financial condition capital levels cash requirements future prospects regulatory review and other factors as further described in item businesssupervision and regulation a downgrade in our credit ratings could significantly impact our liquidity funding costs and access to the capital markets our credit ratings are based on a number of factors including financial strength as well as factors not within our control including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally the macroeconomic environment and changes made by rating agencies to their methodologies or ratings criteria our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any of the rating agencies which could among other things adversely affect our ability to borrow funds increase our funding cost increase our cost of capital limit the number of investors or counterparties willing to do business with or lend to us adversely limit our ability to access the capital markets and have a negative impact on our results of operations operational risk we face risks related to our operational technological and organizational infrastructure our ability to retain and attract customers depends on our ability to develop operate and adapt our technology and organizational infrastructure in a rapidly changing environment in addition we must accurately process record and monitor an increasingly large number of complex transactions digital technology cloudbased services data and software development are deeply embedded into our business model and how we work similar to other large corporations in our industry we are exposed to operational risk that can manifest itself in many ways such as errors in execution inadequate processes inaccurate models faulty or disabled technological infrastructure malicious disruption and fraud by employees or persons outside of our company whether through attacks on capital one directly or on our thirdparty service providers or customers in addition the increasing use of near realtime money movement solutions table start capital one financial corporation cof table end among other risks increases the complexity of preventing detecting and recovering fraudulent transactions we are also heavily dependent on the security capability integrity and continuous availability of the technology systems that we use to manage our internal financial and other systems monitor risk and compliance with regulatory requirements provide services to our customers develop and offer new products and communicate with stakeholders we also face risk of adverse customer impacts and business disruption arising from the execution of strategic initiatives and operational plans we may pursue across our operations for example when we launch a new product service or platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services acquire or invest in a business or make changes to an existing product service or delivery platform there is the risk of execution issues related to changes to operations or processes these issues could be driven by insufficient mitigation of operational risks associated with the change implementation inadequate training failure to account for new or changed requirements or failure to identify or address impacted downstream processes in addition we may experience increased costs andor disruptions due to our hybrid work model which could also affect our ability to operate effectively and maintain our corporate culture if we do not maintain the necessary operational technological and organizational infrastructure to operate our business including to maintain the resiliency and security of that infrastructure our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected we also are subject to disruptions to our systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which may include computer viruses computer telecommunications network utility electronic or physical infrastructure outages bugs errors insider threats design flaws in systems or platforms availability and quality of vulnerability patches from key vendors cyberattacks and other security incidents natural disasters other damage to property or physical assets or events arising from local or larger scale politics including civil unrest terrorist acts and military conflict any failure to maintain our infrastructure or prevent disruption of our systems and applications could diminish our ability to operate our businesses service customer accounts and protect customers information or result in potential liability to customers reputational damage regulatory intervention and customers loss of confidence in our businesses any of which could result in a material adverse effect we also rely on the business infrastructure and systems of third parties and their supply chains with which we do business andor to whom we outsource the operation maintenance and development of our information technology and communications systems we have substantially migrated primarily all aspects of our core information technology systems and customerfacing applications to thirdparty cloud infrastructure platforms principally aws if we fail to architect administer or oversee these environments in a wellmanaged secure and effective manner or if such platforms become unavailable are disrupted fail to scale do not operate as designed or do not meet their service level agreements for any reason we may experience unplanned service disruption or unforeseen costs which could result in material harm to our business and operations we must successfully develop and maintain information financial reporting disclosure privacy data protection data security and other controls adapted to our reliance on outside platforms and providers in addition aws or other service providers including without limitation those who also rely on aws could experience system or telecommunication breakdowns or failures outages degradation in service downtime failure to scale software bugs design flaws cyberattacks and other security incidents insider threats adverse changes to financial condition bankruptcy or other adverse conditions including conditions which interfere with our access to and use of aws which could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation we also face a risk that our thirdparty service providers might be unable or unwilling to continue to provide these or other services to meet our current or future needs in an efficient costeffective or favorable manner or may terminate or seek to terminate their contractual relationship with us any transition to alternative thirdparty service providers or internal solutions may be difficult to implement may cause us to incur significant time and expense and may disrupt or degrade our ability to deliver our products and services thus the substantial amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to aws or to other thirdparty service providers may increase our risk exposure any disruptions failures or inaccuracies of our operational processes technology systems and models including those associated with improvements or modifications to such technology systems and models or failure to identify or effectively respond to operational risks in a timely manner and continue to deliver our services through an operational disruption could cause us to be unable to market and manage our products and services manage our risk meet our regulatory obligations or report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner all of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations in addition our ongoing investments in infrastructure which are necessary to maintain a competitive business integrate acquisitions and establish scalable operations may increase our expenses as our business develops changes or expands additional expenses can arise as a result of a reevaluation of business strategies or risks management of outsourced services asset purchases or other acquisitions structural reorganization compliance with new laws or regulations the integration of newly acquired businesses or the prevention or occurrence of cyberattacks and other security incidents if we are table start capital one financial corporation cof table end unable to successfully manage our expenses our financial results will be negatively affected changes to our business including those resulting from our strategic imperatives also require robust governance to ensure that our objectives are executed as intended without adversely impacting our customers associates operations or financial performance ineffective change management oversight and governance over the execution of our key projects and initiatives could expose us to operational strategic and reputational risk and could negatively impact customers or our financial performance a cyberattack or other security incident on us or third parties including their supply chains with which we conduct business including an incident that results in the theft loss manipulation or misuse of information including personal information or the disabling of systems and access to information critical to business operations may result in increased costs reductions in revenue reputational damage legal exposure and business disruptions our ability to provide our products and services and communicate with our customers depends upon the management and safeguarding of information systems and infrastructure networks software data technology methodologies and business secrets including those of our service providers our products and services involve the collection authentication management usage storage transmission and destruction of sensitive and confidential information including personal information regarding our customers and their accounts our employees our partners and other third parties with which we do business we also have arrangements in place with thirdparty business partners through which we share and receive information about their customers who are or may become our customers the financial services industry including capital one is particularly at risk because of the increased use of and reliance on digital banking products and other digital services including mobile banking products such as mobile payments and other internet and cloudbased products and applications and the development of additional remote connectivity solutions which increase cybersecurity risks and exposure in addition global events and geopolitical instability including without limitation the war between israel and hamas the war between ukraine and russia and the related sanctions imposed by the us and other countries and increased geopolitical tensions between the us and china may lead to increased nation state targeting of financial institutions in the us and abroad technologies systems networks and other devices of capital one as well as those of our employees service providers partners and other third parties with whom we interact have been and may continue to be the subject of cyberattacks and other security incidents including computer viruses hacking malware ransomware supply chain attacks vulnerabilities credential stuffing account takeovers insider threats business email compromise scams or phishing or other forms of social engineering such cyberattacks and other security incidents are designed to lead to various harmful outcomes such as unauthorized transactions in capital one accounts unauthorized or unintended access to or release gathering monitoring disclosure loss destruction corruption disablement encryption misuse modification or other processing of confidential or sensitive information including personal information intellectual property software methodologies or business secrets disruption sabotage or degradation of service systems or networks an attempt to extort capital one its thirdparty service providers or its business partners or other damage cyberattacks and other security incidents that occur in the supply chain of third parties with which we interact could also negatively impact capital one these threats may derive from among other things error fraud or malice on the part of our employees insiders or third parties or may result from accidental technological failure or design flaws any of these parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees service providers customers partners or other thirdparty users of our systems or networks to disclose confidential or sensitive information including personal information in order to gain access to our systems networks or data or that of our customers partners or third parties with whom we interact or to unlawfully obtain monetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise improper payment for instance any party that obtains our confidential or sensitive information including personal information through a cyberattack or other security incident may use this information for ransom to be paid by us or a third party as part of a fraudulent activity that is part of a broader criminal activity or for other illicit purposes additionally the failure of our employees thirdparty service providers or business partners or their respective supply chains to exercise sound judgment and vigilance when targeted with social engineering or other cyberattacks may increase our vulnerability for example on july we announced that on march and an outside individual gained unauthorized access to our systems the cybersecurity incident this individual obtained certain types of personal information relating to people who had applied for our credit card products and to our credit card customers while the cybersecurity incident has been remediated it resulted in fines litigation consent orders settlements government investigations and other regulatory enforcement inquiries cyber and information security risks for large financial institutions like us continue to increase due to the proliferation of new technologies the industrywide shift to reliance upon the internet to conduct financial transactions the increased sophistication and activities of malicious actors organized crime perpetrators of fraud hackers terrorists activists extremist parties formal and informal instrumentalities of foreign governments statesponsored or nationstate actors and other external parties and the growing use of ai by threat actors in addition our customers access our products and services using personal devices that are necessarily external to our security control systems there has also been a significant proliferation of table start capital one financial corporation cof table end consumer information available on the internet resulting from breaches of thirdparty entities including personal information login credentials and authentication data these thirdparty breach events could create a threat for our customers if their capital one login credentials are the same as or similar to the credentials that have been compromised on other internet sites this threat could include the risk of unauthorized account access data loss and fraud the use of ai bots or other automation software can increase the velocity and efficacy of these types of attacks as our employees are operating under our hybrid work model our remote interaction with employees service providers partners and other third parties on systems networks and environments over which we have less control such as through employees personal devices increases our cybersecurity risk exposure we will likely face an increasing number of attempted cyberattacks as we expand our mobile and other internetbased products and services as well as our usage of mobile and cloud technologies and as we provide more of these services to a greater number of retail banking customers the methods and techniques employed by malicious actors develop and evolve rapidly including from emerging technologies such as advanced forms of ai and quantum computing are increasingly sophisticated and often are not fully recognized or understood until after they have occurred and some techniques could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected and remediated for example although we immediately fixed the configuration vulnerability that was exploited in the cybersecurity incident once we discovered the unauthorized access a period of time elapsed between the occurrence of the unauthorized access and the time when we discovered it in other circumstances we and our service providers and other third parties with which we interact may be unable to anticipate or identify certain attack methods or techniques in order to implement effective preventative or detective measures or mitigate or remediate the damages caused in a timely manner we may also be unable to hire develop and retain talent that keeps pace with the rapidly changing cyber threat landscape and which are capable of preventing detecting mitigating or remediating these risks although we seek to maintain a robust suite of authentication and layered information security controls any one or combination of these controls could fail to prevent detect mitigate remediate or recover from these risks in a timely manner an actual suspected threatened or alleged disruption or breach including as a result of a cyberattack such as the cybersecurity incident or media including social media reports of alleged or perceived security vulnerabilities or incidents at capital one or at our service providers could result in significant legal and financial exposure regulatory intervention litigation enforcement actions remediation costs card reissuance supervisory liability damage to our reputation or loss of confidence in the security of our systems products and services that could adversely affect our business moreover new regulations may require us to publicly disclose certain information about certain cybersecurity incidents before they have been resolved or fully investigated there can be no assurance that unauthorized access or cyber incidents similar to the cybersecurity incident will not occur or that we will not suffer material losses in the future if future attacks are successful or if customers are unable to access their accounts online for other reasons it could adversely impact our ability to service customer accounts or loans complete financial transactions for our customers or otherwise operate any of our businesses or services in addition a breach or attack affecting one of our service providers or other third parties with which we interact could harm our business even if we do not control the service that is attacked further our ability to monitor our service providers and other business partners cybersecurity practices is inherently limited although the agreements that we have in place with our service providers and other business partners generally include requirements relating to privacy data protection and data security we cannot guarantee that such agreements will prevent a cyber incident impacting our systems or information or enable us to obtain adequate or any reimbursement from our service providers or other business partners in the event we should suffer any such incidents however due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations we may be held responsible for cyber incidents attributed to our service providers and other business partners as they relate to the information we share with them in addition we continue to incur increased costs with respect to preventing detecting investigating mitigating remediating and recovering from cybersecurity risks as well as any related attempted fraud in order to address ongoing and future risks we must expend significant resources to support protective security measures investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities of our information systems and infrastructure and invest in new technology designed to mitigate security risks further high profile cyber incidents at capital one or other large financial institutions could undermine our competitive advantage and divert management attention and resources lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect us including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or the global financial system in general which could result in reduced use of our financial products we have insurance against some cyber risks and attacks nonetheless our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event including if our insurer denies coverage as to any particular claim in the future and such insurance may increase in cost or cease to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all in the future table start capital one financial corporation cof table end we face risks resulting from the extensive use of models ai and data we rely on quantitative models and the use of ai as well as our ability to manage and aggregate data in an accurate and timely manner to assess and manage our various risk exposures create estimates and forecasts and manage compliance with regulatory capital requirements we continue to invest in building new capabilities that employ new ai technologies such as generative ai and we expect our use of these technologies to increase over time however there are significant risks involved in utilizing models and ai and no assurance can be provided that our use will produce only intended or beneficial results ai may subject us to new or heightened legal regulatory ethical or other challenges and negative public opinion of ai could impair the acceptance of ai solutions if the models or ai solutions that we create or use are deficient inaccurate or controversial we could incur operational inefficiencies competitive harm legal liability brand or reputational harm or other adverse impacts on our business and financial results we also may incur liability through the violation of applicable laws and regulations thirdparty intellectual property privacy or other rights or contracts to which we are a party we may use models and ai in processes such as determining the pricing of various products identifying potentially fraudulent transactions grading loans and extending credit measuring interest rate and other market risks predicting deposit levels or loan losses assessing capital adequacy calculating managerial and regulatory capital levels estimating the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items and other operational functions development and implementation of some of these models such as the models for credit loss accounting under cecl require us to make difficult subjective and complex judgments our risk reporting and management including business decisions based on information incorporating models and the use of ai depend on the effectiveness of our models and ai and our policies programs processes and practices governing how data models and ai as applicable are acquired validated stored protected processed and analyzed any issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedures as well as the quality and integrity of data inputs formulas or algorithms could result in inaccurate forecasts ineffective risk management practices or inaccurate risk reporting in addition models and ai based on historical data sets might not be accurate predictors of future outcomes and their ability to appropriately predict future outcomes may degrade over time due to limited historical patterns extreme or unanticipated market movements or customer behavior and liquidity especially during severe market downturns or stress events eg geopolitical or pandemic events while we continuously update our policies programs processes and practices many of our data management modeling ai aggregation and implementation processes are manual and may be subject to human error data limitations process delays or system failure failure to manage data effectively and to aggregate data in an accurate and timely manner may limit our ability to manage current and emerging risk to produce accurate financial regulatory and operational reporting as well as to manage changing business needs if our framework is ineffective we could suffer unexpected losses which could materially adversely affect our results of operation or financial condition also any information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on incorrectly designed or implemented models or ai could be inaccurate or misleading some of the decisions that our regulators make including those related to capital distribution to our stockholders could be affected adversely due to the perception that the quality of the data models and ai used to generate the relevant information is insufficient in addition regulation of ai is rapidly evolving worldwide as legislators and regulators are increasingly focused on these powerful emerging technologies the technologies underlying ai and its uses are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including intellectual property privacy data protection and information security consumer protection competition and equal opportunity laws and are expected to be subject to increased regulation and new laws or new applications of existing laws and regulations ai is the subject of ongoing review by various us governmental and regulatory agencies and various us states and other foreign jurisdictions are applying or are considering applying their platform moderation privacy data protection and data security laws and regulations to ai or are considering general legal frameworks for ai we may not be able to anticipate how to respond to these rapidly evolving frameworks and we may need to expend resources to adjust our offerings in certain jurisdictions if the legal frameworks are inconsistent across jurisdictions furthermore because ai technology itself is highly complex and rapidly developing it is not possible to predict all of the legal operational or technological risks that may arise relating to the use of ai legal and regulatory risk compliance with new and existing domestic and foreign laws regulations and regulatory expectations is costly and complex a wide array of laws and regulations including banking and consumer lending laws and regulations apply to every aspect of our business and these laws can be uncertain and evolving we and our subsidiaries are also subject to supervision and examination by multiple regulators both in the us and abroad and the manner in which our regulators interpret applicable laws and regulations may affect how we comply with them failure to comply with these laws and regulations even if the failure was inadvertent or reflects a difference in interpretation or conflicting legal requirements could subject us to restrictions table start capital one financial corporation cof table end on our business activities fines criminal sanctions and other penalties andor damage to our reputation with regulators our customers or the public hiring training and retaining qualified compliance and legal personnel and establishing and maintaining risk management and compliancerelated systems infrastructure and processes is difficult and may lead to increased expenses these efforts and the associated costs could limit our ability to invest in other business opportunities in addition actions behaviors or practices by us our employees or representatives that are illegal unethical or contrary to our core values could harm us our stockholders or customers or damage the integrity of the financial markets and are subject to regulatory scrutiny across jurisdictions violations of law by other financial institutions may also result in increased regulatory scrutiny of our business applicable rules and regulations may affect us disproportionately compared to our competitors or in an unforeseen manner for example we have a large number of customer accounts in our credit card and auto lending businesses and we have made the strategic choice to originate and service subprime credit card and auto loans which typically have higher delinquencies and chargeoffs than prime customer accounts as a result we have significant involvement with credit bureau reporting and the collection and recovery of delinquent and chargedoff debt primarily through customer communications the filing of litigation against customers in default the periodic sale of chargedoff debt and vehicle repossession these and other consumer lending activities are subject to enhanced legal and regulatory scrutiny from regulators courts and legislators any future changes to or legal liabilities resulting from our business practices in these areas including our debt collection practices and the fees we charge whether mandated by regulators courts legislators or otherwise could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition the legislative and regulatory environment is beyond our control may change rapidly and unpredictably and may negatively influence our revenue costs earnings growth liquidity and capital levels for example the cfpb has announced several initiatives related to the amounts and types of fees financial institutions may charge including by issuing a proposed rule that would among other things significantly lower the safe harbor amount for past due fees that a credit card issuer can charge on consumer credit card accounts such changes could affect our ability or willingness to provide certain products or services necessitate changes to the our business practices or reduce our revenues there may also be future rulemaking in emerging regulatory areas such as climaterelated risks and new technologies adoption of new technologies such as distributed ledger technologies tokenization cloud computing ai and machine learning technologies can present unforeseen challenges in applying and relying on existing compliance systems in addition some laws and regulations may be subject to litigation or other challenges that delay or modify their implementation and impact on us certain laws and regulations and any interpretations and applications with respect thereto are generally intended to protect consumers borrowers depositors the dif the us banking and financial system and financial markets as a whole but not stockholders our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with both existing and new laws and regulations for a description of the material laws and regulations including those related to the consumer lending business to which we are subject see item businesssupervision and regulation our required compliance with applicable laws and regulations related to privacy data protection and data security in addition to compliance with our own privacy policies and contractual obligations to third parties may increase our costs reduce our revenue increase our legal exposure and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the united states at the federal state and local level regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer security and other processing of personal information for example at the federal level we are subject to the glba and the fcra among other laws and regulations moreover legislative changes have been proposed in the us congress for more comprehensive privacy data protection and data security legislation to which we may be subject if passed the enactment of circia once rulemaking is complete will require among other things certain companies to report significant cyber incidents to the cisa within hours from the time the company reasonably believes the incident occurred at the state level california has enacted the cpra and various other states also have enacted or are in the process of enacting statelevel privacy data protection andor data security laws and regulations with which we may be required to comply additionally the federal banking agencies as well as the sec and related selfregulatory organizations regularly issue guidance regarding cybersecurity that is intended to enhance cyber risk management among financial institutions we also are or may become subject to continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in other jurisdictions regarding privacy data protection and data security for example in canada we are subject to the personal information protection and electronic documents act pipeda and may become subject to additional privacy data protection and data security laws and regulations in canada including those which may differ from pipeda if passed in addition subject to table start capital one financial corporation cof table end limited exceptions the eu general data protection regulation eu gdpr applies eu data protection laws to certain companies processing personal data of individuals in the eu regardless of the companys location we also are subject to the uk general data protection regulation uk gdpr which is how the eu gdpr has been implemented into uk law these laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions impose strict requirements regarding the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer security and other processing of personal information which may have adverse consequences including significant compliance costs and severe monetary penalties for noncompliance significant uncertainty exists as privacy data protection and data security laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements further we make public statements about our use collection disclosure and other processing of personal information through our privacy policies information provided on our website and press statements although we endeavor to comply with our public statements and documentation we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so the publication of our privacy policies and other statements that provide promises and assurances about privacy data protection and data security can subject us to potential government or legal action if they are found to be deceptive unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices additional risks could arise in connection with any failure or perceived failure by us our service providers or other third parties with which we do business to provide adequate disclosure or transparency to individuals including our customers about the personal information collected from them and its use to receive document or honor the privacy preferences expressed by individuals to protect personal information from unauthorized disclosure or to maintain proper training on privacy practices for all employees or third parties who have access to personal information in our possession or control our efforts to comply with glba fcra cpra pipeda eu gdpr uk gdpr and other privacy data protection and data security laws and regulations as well as our posted privacy policies and related contractual obligations to third parties entail substantial expenses may divert resources from other initiatives and projects and could limit the services we are able to offer furthermore enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy data protection and data security violations continue to increase the enactment of more restrictive laws or regulations or future enforcement actions litigation or investigations could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business and any noncompliance or perceived noncompliance could result in monetary or other penalties harm to our reputation distraction to our management and technical personnel and significant legal liability our businesses are subject to the risk of increased litigation government investigations and regulatory enforcement our businesses are subject to increased litigation government investigations and other regulatory enforcement risks as a result of a number of factors and from various sources including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry and the structure of the credit card industry given the inherent uncertainties involved in litigation government investigations and regulatory enforcement decisions and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some matters asserted against us there can be significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these kinds of matters the finding or even the assertion of substantial legal liability against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and could cause significant reputational harm to us which could seriously harm our business for example the cybersecurity incident has resulted in litigation consent orders settlements government investigations and other regulatory enforcement inquiries in addition financial institutions such as ourselves face significant regulatory scrutiny which can lead to public enforcement actions or nonpublic supervisory actions we and our subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by among other regulatory bodies the federal banking agencies sec cftc and cfpb we have been subject to enforcement actions by many of these and other regulators and may continue to be involved in such actions including governmental inquiries investigations and enforcement proceedings including by the occ department of justice the fincen and state attorneys general over the last several years federal and state regulators have focused on risk management compliance with antimoney laundering aml and sanctions laws privacy data protection and data security use of service providers fair lending and other consumer protection issues and innovative activities such as those that utilize new technology in august we entered into consent orders with the federal reserve and the occ resulting from regulatory reviews of the cybersecurity incident and relating to ongoing enhancements of our cybersecurity and operational risk management processes and we paid a civil monetary penalty as part of the occ agreement the occ and the federal reserve have since terminated their consent orders in january we also paid a civil monetary penalty assessed by fincen against the bank in connection with aml table start capital one financial corporation cof table end violations alleged to have occurred between and regulatory scrutiny is expected to continue in these areas including as a result of implementation of the aml act of we expect that regulators and governmental enforcement bodies will continue taking public enforcement actions against financial institutions in addition to addressing supervisory concerns through nonpublic supervisory actions or findings which could involve restrictions on our activities or our ability to make acquisitions or otherwise expand our business among other limitations that could adversely affect our business in addition a violation of law or regulation by another financial institution is likely to give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by us furthermore a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings these and other initiatives from governmental authorities and officials may subject us to further judgments settlements fines or penalties or cause us to restructure our operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services all of which could harm our reputation or lead to higher operational costs litigation government investigations and other regulatory actions could generally subject us to significant fines increased expenses restrictions on our activities and damage to our reputation and our brand and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations for additional information regarding legal and regulatory proceedings to which we are subject see part iiitem financial statements and supplementary datanote 18commitments contingencies guarantees and others other business risks we face intense competition in all of our markets which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations we operate in a highly competitive environment across all of our lines of business whether in making loans attracting deposits or in the global payments industry and we expect competitive conditions to continue to intensify with respect to most of our products particularly in our credit card and consumer banking businesses we compete on the basis of the rates we pay on deposits and the rates and other terms we charge on the loans we originate or purchase as well as the quality and range of our customer service products innovation and experience this competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in technology product delivery systems and regulation as well as the emergence of new or significantly larger financial services providers all of which may affect our customers expectations and demands in addition to offering competitive products and services we invest in and conduct marketing campaigns to attract and inform customers if our marketing campaigns are unsuccessful it may adversely impact our ability to attract new customers and grow market share some of our competitors including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space and other financial technology providers are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or scrutiny to which we are subject which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage in particular in the development of new technology platforms or the ability to rapidly innovate we compete with many forms of payments offered by both bank and nonbank providers including a variety of new and evolving alternative payment mechanisms systems and products such as aggregators and webbased and wireless payment platforms or technologies digital or cryptocurrencies prepaid systems and payment services targeting users of social networks communications platforms and online gaming if we are unable to continue to keep pace with innovation do not effectively market our products and services or are prohibited from or unwilling to enter emerging areas of competition our business and results of operations could be adversely affected in addition government actions or initiatives may also provide competitors with increased opportunities to derive competitive advantages and may create new competitors for example the cfpb has proposed a rule that would require certain financial institutions including the company to share certain financial information with third parties upon a customers request which could enable those third parties to offer competing financial services to consumers some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are which may give those competitors advantages including a more diversified product and customer base the ability to reach more customers and potential customers operational efficiencies broadbased local distribution capabilities lowercost funding and larger existing branch networks many of our competitors are also focusing on crossselling their products and developing new products or technologies which could affect our ability to maintain or grow existing customer relationships or require us to offer lower interest rates or fees on our lending products or higher interest rates on deposits competition for loans could result in origination of fewer loans earning less on our loans or an increase in loans that perform below expectations we operate as an online direct bank in the united states while direct banking provides a significant opportunity to attract new customers that value greater and more flexible access to banking services at reduced costs we face strong and increasing competition in the direct banking market aggressive pricing throughout the industry may adversely affect the retention of existing balances and the costefficient acquisition of new deposit funds and may affect our growth and profitability customers table start capital one financial corporation cof table end could also close their online accounts or reduce balances or deposits in favor of products and services offered by competitors for other reasons these shifts which could be rapid could result from general dissatisfaction with our products or services including concerns over pricing online security or our reputation the potential consequences of this competitive environment are exacerbated by the flexibility of direct banking and the financial and technological sophistication of our online customer base in our credit card business competition for rewards customers may result in higher rewards expenses or we may fail to attract new customers or retain existing rewards customers due to increasing competition for these consumers as of december we have a number of large partnerships in our credit card loan portfolio the market for key business partners especially in the credit card business is very competitive and we may not be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships or assure that these relationships will be profitable or valued by our customers additionally partners themselves may face changes in their business including market factors and ownership changes that could impact the partnership we face the risk that we could lose partner relationships even after we have invested significant resources into acquiring and developing the relationships the loss of any key business partner could have a negative impact on our results of operations including lower returns excess operating expense and excess funding capacity we depend on our partners to effectively promote our cobrand and private label products and integrate the use of our credit cards into their retail operations the failure by our partners to effectively promote and support our products as well as changes they may make in their business models could adversely affect card usage and our ability to achieve the growth and profitability objectives of our partnerships in addition if our partners do not adhere to the terms of our program agreements and standards or otherwise diminish the value of our brand we may suffer reputational damage and customers may be less likely to use our products some of our competitors have developed or may develop substantially greater financial and other resources than we have may offer richer value propositions or a wider range of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising marketing or crossselling strategies to acquire and retain more customers capture a greater share of spending and borrowings attain and develop more attractive cobrand card programs and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have we may not be able to compete effectively against these threats or respond or adapt to changes in consumer spending habits as effectively as our competitors in such a competitive environment we may lose entire accounts or may lose account balances to competing firms or we may find it more costly to maintain our existing customer base customer attrition from any or all of our lending products together with any lowering of interest rates or fees that we might implement to retain customers could reduce our revenues and therefore our earnings similarly unexpected customer attrition from our deposit products in addition to an increase in rates or services that we may offer to retain deposits may increase our expenses and therefore reduce our earnings our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by merchants efforts to reduce the fees charged by credit and debit card networks to facilitate card transactions and by legislation and regulation impacting such fees interchange fees are the amounts established by credit and debit card networks for the purpose of compensating debit and credit card issuers for their role in facilitating card transactions and are a meaningful source of revenue for our credit and debit card businesses interchange fees are a revenue source that for example covers the issuers costs associated with credit and debit card payments fund rewards programs offset fraud management and dispute costs and fund competition and innovation interchange fees continue to be the subject of significant and intense global legal legislative and regulatory focus and the resulting decisions legislation and regulation may have a material adverse impact on our overall business financial condition and results of operations legislative and regulatory bodies in a number of countries have sought or are currently seeking to reduce interchange fees through legislation competitionrelated regulatory proceedings voluntary agreements central bank regulation andor litigation for credit transactions interchange reimbursement rates in the united states are set by credit card networks such as mastercard and visa in some jurisdictions such as canada and certain countries in europe including the uk interchange fees and related practices are subject to regulatory activity including in some cases imposing caps on permissible interchange fees our international card businesses have been impacted by these restrictions for example in the uk interchange fees are capped for both credit and debit card transactions in addition in canada visa and mastercard payment networks have entered into voluntary table start capital one financial corporation cof table end agreements with the department of finance canada to maintain an agreed upon average interchange rate lowering interchange fees remains an area of domestic and international governmental attention by certain parties in addition to this regulatory activity merchants are also seeking avenues to reduce interchange fees merchants and their trade groups have filed numerous lawsuits against payment card networks and banks that issue cards on those networks claiming that their practices toward merchants including interchange fees violate federal antitrust laws in a number of entities filed antitrust lawsuits against mastercard and visa and several member banks including our subsidiaries and us alleging among other things that the defendants conspired to fix the level of interchange fees for additional information about the lawsuits see part iiitem financial statements and supplementary datanote 18commitments contingencies guarantees and others for further details some major retailers or industry sectors could independently negotiate lower interchange fees with mastercard and visa which could in turn result in lower interchange fees for us when our cardholders undertake purchase transactions with these retailers merchants continue to lobby congress aggressively for legislation that would require additional routing requirements for credit cards that are issued on fourparty networks like visa or mastercard which could create a downward pressure on interchange fees should their efforts be successful retailers may continue to bring legal proceedings against us or other credit card and debit card issuers and networks in the future for debit transactions regulation ii debit card interchange fees and routing which was issued by the federal reserve in place limits on the interchange fees we may charge and requires additional routing requirements for debit cards issued on fourparty networks like visa or mastercard on october the federal reserve released a notice of proposed rulemaking to revise regulation ii to further reduce the interchange fee cap that debit card issuers covered by regulation ii can receive for debit card transactions for more information on these rules please see item businesssupervision and regulation beyond pursuing litigation legislation and regulation merchants may also promote forms of payment with lower fees or seek to impose surcharges or discounts at the point of sale for use of credit or debit cards new payment systems particularly mobilebased payment technologies could also gain widespread adoption and lead to issuer transaction fees or the displacement of credit or debit cards as a payment method the heightened focus by merchants and legislative and regulatory bodies on the fees charged by credit and debit card networks and the ability of certain merchants to successfully negotiate discounts to interchange fees with mastercard and visa or develop alternative payment systems could result in a loss of income any resulting loss in income to us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we are not able to invest successfully in and introduce digital and other technological developments across all our businesses our financial performance may suffer our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes and our ability to meet our customers needs and expectations is key to our ability to grow revenue and earnings we expect digital technologies to continue to have a significant impact on banking over time consumers expect robust digital experiences from their financial services providers the ability for customers to access their accounts and conduct financial transactions using digital technology including mobile applications is an important aspect of the financial services industry and financial institutions are rapidly introducing new digital and other technologydriven products and services that aim to offer a better customer experience and to reduce costs we continue to invest in digital technology designed to attract new customers facilitate the ability of existing customers to conduct financial transactions and enhance the customer experience related to our products and services our continued success depends in part upon our ability to assess and address the needs of our customers by using digital technology to provide products and services that meet their expectations the development and launch of new digital products and services depends in large part on our ability to invest in and build the technology platforms that can enable them in a cost effective and timely manner we expect that new technologies in the payments industry will continue to emerge and these new technologies may be superior to our existing technology see we face intense competition in all of our markets and we face risks related to our operational technological and organizational infrastructure some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are which may allow those competitors to invest more money into their technology infrastructure and digital innovation than we do in addition smaller competitors may experience lower cost structures and different regulatory requirements and scrutiny than we do which may allow them to innovate more rapidly than we can see we face intense competition in all of our markets further our success depends on our ability to attract and retain table start capital one financial corporation cof table end strong digital and technology leaders engineers and other specialized personnel the competition is intense and the compensation costs continue to increase for such talent if we are unable to attract and retain digital and technology talent our ability to offer digital products and services and build the necessary technology infrastructure could be negatively affected which could negatively impact our business and financial results a failure to maintain or enhance our competitive position with respect to digital products and services whether because we fail to anticipate customer expectations or because our technological developments fail to perform as desired or are not implemented in a timely or successful manner could negatively impact our business and financial results we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our mergers acquisitions and strategic partnerships we engage in merger and acquisition activity and enter into strategic partnerships from time to time we continue to evaluate and anticipate engaging in among other merger and acquisition activity additional strategic partnerships and selected acquisitions of financial institutions and other businesses or assets including credit card and other loan portfolios we may not be able to identify and secure future acquisition targets on terms and conditions that are acceptable to us or successfully complete and integrate the businesses within the anticipated time frame and achieve the anticipated benefits of proposed mergers acquisitions and strategic partnerships which could impair our growth any merger acquisition or strategic partnership we undertake entails certain risks which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations if we experience greater than anticipated costs to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or are not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger acquisition or strategic partnership including cost savings and other synergies our business could be negatively affected in addition it is possible that the ongoing integration processes could result in the loss of key employees errors or delays in systems implementation exposure to cybersecurity risks associated with acquired businesses exposure to additional regulatory oversight the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with partners clients customers depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger acquisition or strategic partnership integration efforts also may divert management attention and resources these integration matters may have an adverse effect on us during any transition period see additional risk factors under the heading risks relating to the acquisition of discover in addition we may face the following risks in connection with any merger acquisition or strategic partnership new businesses and geographic or other markets our merger acquisition or strategic partnership activity may involve our entry into new businesses or new geographic areas or markets in the us or internationally that present risks resulting from our relative inexperience in these new businesses localities or markets these new businesses localities or markets may change the overall character of our consolidated portfolio of businesses and alter our exposure to economic and other external factors we also face the risk that we will not be successful in these new businesses localities or markets identification and assessment of merger and acquisition targets and deployment of acquired assets we may not be able to identify acquire or partner with suitable targets further our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger acquisition or strategic partnership will depend on our ability to assess the asset quality risks and value of the particular assets or institutions we partner with merge with or acquire we may be unable to profitably deploy any assets we acquire accuracy of assumptions in connection with any merger acquisition or strategic partnership we may make certain assumptions relating to the proposed merger acquisition or strategic partnership that may be or may prove to be inaccurate including as a result of the failure to anticipate the costs timeline or ability to realize the expected benefits of any merger acquisition or strategic partnership the inaccuracy of any assumptions we may make could result in unanticipated consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition targetspecific risk assets and companies that we acquire or companies that we enter into strategic partnerships with will have their own risks that are specific to a particular asset or company these risks include but are not limited to particular or specific regulatory accounting operational reputational and industry risks any of which could have a material

systems or standards of table start capital one financial corporation cof table end conduct indemnification rights if any may be insufficient to compensate us for any losses or damages resulting from such risks in addition to regulatory approvals discussed below certain of our merger acquisition or partnership activity may require thirdparty consents in order for us to fully realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction conditions to regulatory approval we may be required to obtain various governmental and regulatory approvals to consummate certain acquisitions we cannot be certain whether when or on what terms and conditions such approvals may be granted consequently we may not obtain governmental or regulatory approval for a proposed acquisition on acceptable terms or at all in which case we would not be able to complete the acquisition despite investing resources in pursuing it reputational risk and social factors may impact our results and damage our brand our ability to attract and retain customers is highly dependent upon the perceptions of consumer and commercial borrowers and deposit holders and other external perceptions of our products services trustworthiness business practices workplace culture compliance practices or our financial health capital ones brand is one of our most important assets maintaining and enhancing our brand depends largely on our ability to continue to provide highquality products and services adverse perceptions regarding our reputation in the consumer commercial and funding markets could lead to difficulties

technology systems and protect customer data could lead to decreases in the levels of deposits that current and potential consumer and commercial customers choose to maintain with us negative perceptions may also significantly increase the costs of attracting and retaining customers in addition negative perceptions regarding certain industries partners or clients could also prompt us to cease business activities associated with those entities in order to manage reputational risk negative public opinion or damage to our brand could also result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances including lending practices regulatory compliance cyberattacks or other security incidents corporate governance and sales and marketing and from actions taken by regulators or other persons in response to such conduct such conduct could fall short of our customers and the publics heightened expectations of companies of our size with rigorous privacy data protection data security and compliance practices and could further harm our reputation in addition our cobrand and private label credit card partners or other third parties with whom we have important relationships may take actions over which we have limited control that could negatively impact perceptions about us or the financial services industry the proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood that negative public opinion from any of the actual or alleged events discussed above could impact our reputation and business in addition a variety of economic or social factors may cause changes in borrowing activity including credit card use payment patterns and the rate of defaults by account holders and borrowers domestically and internationally these economic and social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels the publics perception regarding the banking industry and consumer debt including credit card use and changing attitudes about the stigma of bankruptcy if consumers develop or maintain negative attitudes about incurring debt or consumption trends decline or if we fail to maintain and enhance our brand or we incur significant expenses to do so our reputation and business and financial results could be materially and negatively affected there has also been an increased focus by investor advocacy groups investment funds and shareholder activists among others on topics related to environmental social and corporate governance policies and our policies practices and disclosure in these areas including those related to climate change reputation risk related to corporate policies and practices on environmental social and corporate governance topics is increasingly complex divergent ideological and social views may create competing stakeholder legislative and regulatory scrutiny that may impact our reputation furthermore responding to environmental social and corporate governance considerations and implementing our related goals and initiatives involve risk and uncertainties require investments and depend in part on thirdparty performance or data that is outside of our control there can be no assurance that we will achieve these goals and initiatives or that any such achievements will have the desired results our failure to achieve progress in these areas on a timely basis if at all could impact our reputation and public perceptions of our business if we are not able to protect our intellectual property our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected we rely on a variety of measures to protect and enhance our intellectual property including copyrights trademarks trade secrets patents and certain restrictions on disclosure solicitation and competition we also undertake other measures to control access to and distribution of our other proprietary and confidential information these measures may not prevent table start capital one financial corporation cof table end misappropriation of our proprietary or confidential information or infringement misappropriation or other violations of our intellectual property rights and a resulting loss of competitive advantage in addition our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents for innovations that are used in our industry or allege that our systems processes or technologies infringe misappropriate or violate their intellectual property rights given the complex rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environments in which we operate if our competitors or other third parties are successful in obtaining such patents or prevail in intellectual propertyrelated litigation against us we could lose significant revenues incur significant license royalty technology development or other expenses or pay significant damages our risk management strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all market environments or against all types of risk management of market credit liquidity strategic reputational operational and compliance risk requires among other things policies and procedures to properly record and verify a large number of transactions and events see part iiitem mdarisk management for further details our framework is designed to identify measure assess monitor test control report escalate and mitigate the risks that we face even though we continue to devote significant resources to developing and operating our framework our risk management strategies may not be fully effective in identifying and mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated some of our methods of managing these risks are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior the use of analytical andor forecasting models and managements judgment these methods may not accurately predict future exposures which could be significantly greater than the historical measures or models indicate and market conditions particularly during a period of financial market stress can involve unprecedented dislocations for example credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from among other things extending credit to customers our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select manage and underwrite our consumer and commercial customers become less predictive of future chargeoffs due for example to rapid changes in the economy or degradation in the predictive nature of credit bureau and other data used in underwriting while we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the timing of such outcomes for example our ability to implement our risk management strategies may be hindered by adverse changes in the volatility or liquidity conditions in certain markets and as a result may limit our ability to distribute such risks for instance when we seek to syndicate exposure in bridge financing transactions we have underwritten we may therefore incur losses in the course of our risk management or investing activities our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to attract develop retain and motivate key senior leaders and skilled employees our success depends in large part on our ability to retain key senior leaders and to attract develop and retain skilled employees particularly employees with advanced expertise in credit risk digital and technology skills we depend on our senior leaders and skilled employees to oversee simultaneous transformative initiatives across the enterprise and execute on our business plans in an efficient and effective manner competition for such senior leaders and employees and the costs associated with attracting developing and retaining them is high and competitive while we engage in robust succession planning our key senior leaders have deep and broad industry experience and could be difficult to replace without some degree of disruption our ability to attract develop and retain qualified employees also is affected by perceptions of our culture and management including our position on remote and hybrid work arrangements our profile in the regions where we have offices and the professional opportunities we offer in addition an increase in remote working arrangements by other companies may create more job opportunities for employees and make it more difficult for us to attract and retain key talent regulation or regulatory guidance restricting executive compensation as well as evolving investor expectations may limit the types of compensation arrangements that we may enter into with our most senior leaders and could have a negative impact on our ability to attract retain and motivate such leaders in support of our longterm strategy these laws and regulations may not apply in the same manner to all financial institutions and technology companies which therefore may subject us to more restrictions than other institutions and companies with which we compete for talent and may also hinder our ability to compete for talent with other industries we rely upon our senior leaders not only for business success but also to lead with integrity to the extent our senior leaders behave in a manner that does not comport with our values the consequences to our brand and reputation could be severe and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to attract develop and retain talented senior leadership and employees or to implement appropriate succession plans for our senior leadership our business could be negatively affected table start capital one financial corporation cof table end we face risks from catastrophic events natural disasters geopolitical events and other catastrophic events could harm our employees business and infrastructure including our information technology systems and thirdparty platforms our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities where we are located which are concentrated in the northern virginia and new york metropolitan areas richmond virginia and plano texas this may include a disruption involving damage or loss of access to a physical site cyberattacks and other security incidents terrorist activities the occurrence or worsening of disease outbreaks or pandemics natural disasters extreme weather events electrical outage environmental hazards disruption to technological infrastructure communications or other services we use our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business our business financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by any such disruption and our ability to implement corresponding response measures quickly in addition if a natural disaster or other catastrophic event occurs in certain regions where our business customers or assets securing our loans are concentrated such as the midatlantic new york california or texas metropolitan areas or in regions where our thirdparty platforms are located we could be disproportionately impacted as compared to our competitors the impact of such events and other catastrophes on the overall economy and our physical and transition risks may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations climate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could adversely affect our businesses operations and customers and result in increased costs climate change risks can manifest as physical or transition risks physical risks are the risks from the effects of climate change arising from acute climaterelated events such as hurricanes flooding and wildfires and chronic shifts in climate such as sea level rise and higher average temperatures such events could lead to financial losses or disrupt our operations or those of our customers or third parties on which we rely including through direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility transition risks are the risks resulting from the shift toward a lowercarbon economy arising from the changes in policy consumer and business sentiment or technologies in regards to limiting climate change transition risks including changes in consumer preferences and additional regulatory requirements or taxes could increase our expenses affect credit performance and impact our strategies or those of our customers for example on october the federal banking agencies jointly issued guidance on climaterelated financial risk management for large institutions which applies to us for more information on climaterelated regulatory developments see item businesssupervision and regulation physical and transition risks could also affect the financial health of certain customers in impacted industries or geographies in addition we face reputational risk as a result of our policies practices disclosures and decisions related to climate change and the environment or the practices or involvement of our clients or vendors and suppliers in certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate change further there is increased scrutiny of climate changerelated policies goals and disclosures which could result in litigation and regulatory investigations and actions we may incur additional costs and require additional resources as we evolve our strategy practices and related disclosures with respect to these matters as climate risk is interconnected with many risk types we continue to enhance processes to embed evolving climate risk considerations into our existing risk management strategies however because the timing and severity of climate change may not be predictable our risk management strategies may not be effective in mitigating climate risk exposure we face risks from the use of or changes to assumptions or estimates in our financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the us us gaap we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements including determining our allowance for credit losses the fair value of certain assets and liabilities and goodwill impairment among other items in addition the fasb the sec and other regulatory bodies may change the financial accounting and reporting standards including those related to assumptions and estimates we use to prepare our financial statements in ways that we cannot predict and that could impact our financial statements if actual results differ from the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements or if financial accounting and reporting standards are changed we may experience unexpected material losses for a discussion of our use of estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see part iiitem mdacritical accounting policies and estimates and part iiitem financial statements and supplementary datanote 1summary of significant accounting policies the soundness of other financial institutions and other third parties actual or perceived could adversely affect us table start capital one financial corporation cof table end our ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the stability and actions of other financial services institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing servicing counterparty and other relationships we have exposure to financial institutions intermediaries and counterparties that are exposed to risks over which we have little or no control recently several financial services institutions have failed or required outside liquidity support in many cases as a result of the inability of the institutions to obtain needed liquidity for example during silicon valley bank signature bank and first republic bank were closed and placed under fdic receivership this has led to additional risk for other financial services institutions and the financial services industry generally as a result of increased lack of confidence in the financial sector the failure of other banks and financial institutions and the measures taken by governments businesses and other organizations in response to these events could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations for information on the fdics special assessment following the closures of silicon valley bank and signature bank see item businesssupervision and regulation in addition we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients resulting in a significant credit concentration with respect to the financial services industry overall as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions likewise adverse developments affecting the overall strength and soundness of our competitors the financial services industry as a whole and the general economic climate and the us treasury market could have a negative impact on perceptions about the strength and soundness of our business even if we are not subject to the same adverse developments in addition adverse developments with respect to third parties with whom we have important relationships also could negatively impact perceptions about us these perceptions about us could cause our business to be negatively affected and exacerbate the other risks that we face moreover the speed with which information spreads through social media enhanced technology and other news sources on the internet and the ease with which customers transact may amplify the onset and negative effects from such perceptions
