a certain extent issuers of debit cards in general customers are attracted to credit card issuers largely on the basis of price credit limit reward programs customer experience and other product features our consumer banking and commercial banking businesses compete with national state and direct banks for deposits commercial and auto loans as well as with savings and loan associations and credit unions for loans and deposits our competitors also include automotive finance companies commercial banking companies and other financial services providers that provide loans deposits and other similar services and products in addition we compete against nondepository institutions that are able to offer these products and services we also consider new and emerging companies in digital and mobile payments and other financial technology providers among our competitors we compete with many forms of payment mechanisms systems and products offered by both bank and nonbank providers our businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and range of their products and services transaction execution innovation and price competition varies based on the types of clients customers industries and geographies served our ability to compete depends in part on our ability to attract and retain our associates and on our reputation as well as our ability to keep pace with innovation in particular in the development of new technology platforms there can be no assurance however that our ability to market products and services successfully or to obtain adequate returns on our

riskweighted assets expanded riskbased approach an institution subject to the proposal would be required to calculate its riskweighted assets under both the expanded riskbased approach and the existing basel iii standardized approach and for each riskbased capital ratio would be bound by the calculation that produces the lower ratio all capital buffer requirements including the stress capital buffer requirement would apply regardless of whether the expanded riskbased approach or the existing basel iii standardized approach produces the lower ratio the proposal would also replace the existing approach for calculating market risk with a new approach based on both internal models and standardized methodologies the basel iii finalization proposal would also make certain changes to the calculation of regulatory capital for category iii and iv institutions under the proposal these institutions would be required to begin recognizing certain elements of aoci in cet1 capital including unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities the proposal would also generally reduce the threshold above which these institutions must deduct certain assets from their cet1 capital including certain deferred tax assets mortgage servicing assets and investments in unconsolidated financial institutions the basel iii finalization proposal includes a proposed effective date of july subject to a threeyear transition period ending july over which riskweighted assets calculated under the expanded riskbased approach and the recognition of aoci in cet1 capital would be phased in fdicia and prompt corrective action the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia requires the federal banking agencies to take pca for banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements fdicia establishes five capital ratio levels well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized the three undercapitalized categories are based upon the amount by which a bank falls below the ratios applicable to an adequately capitalized institution the capital categories relate to fdicias pca provisions and such capital categories may not constitute an accurate representation of the banks overall financial condition or prospects the basel iii capital rules updated the pca framework to reflect new higher regulatory capital minimums for an insured depository institution to be well capitalized it must maintain a total riskbased capital ratio of or more a tier capital ratio of or more a cet1 capital ratio of or more and a leverage ratio of or more an adequately capitalized depository institution must maintain a total riskbased capital ratio of or more a tier capital ratio of or more a cet1 capital ratio of or more a leverage ratio of or more and for category iii and certain other institutions a supplementary leverage ratio of or more the pca provisions also authorize the federal

referred to as comprehensive capital analysis and review or ccar requirements a covered bhc such as the company must submit a capital plan to the federal reserve on an annual basis that contains a description of all planned capital actions including dividends or stock repurchases over a ninequarter planning horizon beginning with the first quarter of the calendar year the capital plan is submitted pursuant to the capital planning rules the company must file its capital plan with the federal reserve by april of each year unless the federal reserve designates a later date using data as of the end of the prior calendar year the federal reserve will release the results of the supervisory stress test and notify the company of its preliminary stress capital buffer requirement by june of that year and final stress capital buffer requirement by august of that year the companys final stress capital buffer requirement will be effective from october of the year in which the capital plan is submitted through september of the following year the company may make capital distributions in excess of those included in its capital plan without the prior approval of the federal reserve so

known as the doddfrank act stress tests dfast which are a complementary exercise to ccar dfast is a forwardlooking exercise conducted by the federal reserve and each covered company to help assess whether a company has sufficient capital to absorb losses and continue operations during adverse economic conditions in particular the federal reserve is required to conduct annual stress tests on certain covered companies including us to ensure that the covered companies have sufficient capital to absorb losses and continue operations during adverse economic conditions as well as to determine

capital and capital buffer requirements federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus provisions of sections and of the federal reserve act and regulation w governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices in general federal and applicable state banking laws prohibit insured depository institutions such as the bank from making dividend distributions without first obtaining regulatory approval if such distributions are not paid out of available earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet applicable capital adequacy standards liquidity regulation the company and the bank are subject to minimum liquidity standards as adopted by the federal reserve and occ respectively for a further discussion of the minimum liquidity standards see part iiitem mdaliquidity risk profile the basel committee has published a liquidity framework that includes two standards for liquidity risk supervision one standard the liquidity coverage ratio lcr seeks to promote shortterm resilience by requiring organizations to hold sufficient highquality liquid assets hqlas to survive a stress scenario lasting for days the other standard the net stable funding ratio nsfr seeks to promote longerterm resilience by requiring sufficient stable funding over a oneyear period based on the liquidity characteristics of the organizations assets and activities the company and the bank are subject to the lcr standard as implemented by the federal reserve and occ respectively lcr rule the lcr rule requires each of the company and the bank to hold an amount of eligible hqla that equals or exceeds of its respective projected adjusted net cash outflows over a 30day period each as calculated in accordance with table start capital one financial corporation cof table end the lcr rule the lcr rule requires each of the company and the bank to calculate its respective lcr daily in addition the company is required to make quarterly public disclosures of its lcr and certain related quantitative liquidity metrics along with a qualitative discussion of its lcr as a category iii institution with less than billion in weighted average shortterm wholesale funding the companys and the banks total net cash outflows are multiplied by an outflow adjustment percentage of although the bank may hold more hqla than it needs to meet its lcr requirements the lcr rule restricts the amount of such excess hqla held at the bank referred to as trapped liquidity that can be included in the companys hqla amount because we typically manage the banks lcr to levels well above the result is additional trapped liquidity as the banks net cash outflows are reduced by the outflow adjustment percentage of the company and the bank are subject to the nsfr standard as implemented by the federal reserve and occ respectively nsfr rule the nsfr rule requires each of the company and the bank to maintain an amount of available stable funding which is a weighted measure of a companys funding sources over a oneyear time horizon calculated by applying standardized weightings to equity and liabilities based on their expected stability that is no less than a specified percentage of its required stable funding which is calculated by applying standardized weightings to assets derivatives exposures and certain other items based on their liquidity characteristics as a category iii institution the company and the bank are each required to maintain available stable funding in an amount at least equal to of its required stable funding the company is required to make public disclosures of its nsfr every second and fourth quarter including certain quantitative metrics and a qualitative discussion of its nsfr drivers and results in addition to the lcr and nsfr requirements discussed above the company is required to meet liquidity risk management standards conduct internal liquidity stress tests and maintain a 30day buffer of highly liquid assets in each case consistent with federal reserve
