item risk factors our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline we believe that the following information identifies the material factors affecting our company based on the information we currently know however the risks and uncertainties our company faces are not limited to those described below additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business market risks the covid19 pandemic creates significant risks and uncertainties for our business the ongoing coronavirus disease covid19 pandemic has created and continues to create significant and pervasive societal economic and market disruption globally in particular financial markets have seen increased volatility and significant changes to the value of investments if the value of assets under management decreases our revenue and operating results could be substantially impacted while portions of world economies have been differently impacted by the pandemic there is still significant uncertainty around the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business results of operations and financial condition depends on current and future developments these developments are highly uncertain including the scope duration and severity of the pandemic success of worldwide vaccination efforts possible mutations of covid19 or similar diseases the effectiveness of our remote working and our ongoing phased office reopenings the measures that may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak such as legislative action stimulus quarantines and travel restrictions effectiveness of health care and new or interim regulation the actions of third parties in response to the pandemic and the possible further impacts on the global economy it is unclear when we will have a sustained recovery and what that recovery will look like so we seek to effectively manage our risks but our ability to do so is subject to the inherent limitations of obtaining timely reliable analysis in an everchanging situation no assurance can be given that the steps we have taken will continue to be effective or appropriate starting in the end of the first quarter of the covid19 pandemic impacted and will likely continue to impact each of our business segments consumer demand client investing decisions in light of ongoing economic uncertainty our fee and investment income our owned asset values and our credit reserve and other financial or actuarial assumptions and reserve calculations have been and may further be negatively impacted from a decline and volatility of asset prices sustained reduction in interest rates nonperformance credit spreads credit deterioration decreased liquidity in trading markets and other economic and market effects of the global pandemic though we have navigated the first months of the pandemic we continue to actively monitor the potential direct and indirect impacts that the covid19 pandemic may have on our segments the most significant impacts of the covid19 pandemic on the operational and financial results of our core business segments include in our advice wealth management segment the significant and ongoing impact of reduced interest rates and the fee income impact from volatile equity markets and transactional client activity driven by client investing decisions from ongoing economic uncertainty in our asset management segment volatile average equity markets and changes in consumer demand and client investing decisions in light of ongoing economic uncertainty and in our retirement protection solutions segment the significant reduction in interest rates and the impact of volatile equity market levels on spread and fee income and the associated deferred acquisition cost amortization as well as changes in consumer demand and the operating environment that altered our mix of sales and product offerings if these conditions continue or worsen we could experience volatility and uncertainty in volumes uncertainty in availability and price levels of financial assets and hedges reduced client activity and fees increased mortality and morbidity in our insurance policyholder base increased constraints and costs of capital possible impacts to our credit ratings and other negative impacts on our financial position covid19 has had widereaching impacts making many decisions interactions and transactions more complex the covid pandemic may also affect the ability of our suppliers distributors vendors reinsurers and other counterparties to provide products and services and otherwise fulfill their commitments to us our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by market fluctuations and by economic political and other factors our financial condition and results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by economic and other factors such factors which can be global regional national or local in nature include i the covid19 pandemic or any variation thereof ii political social economic and market conditions iii the availability and cost of capital iv the level and volatility of equity prices commodity prices and interest rates currency values and other market indices v technological changes and events vi us and foreign government fiscal and tax policies vii us and foreign government ability real or perceived to avoid defaulting on government securities viii the availability and cost of credit ix inflation x investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets xi terrorism and armed conflicts and xii natural disasters such as weather catastrophes and widespread health emergencies furthermore changes in consumer economic variables such as the number and size of personal bankruptcy filings the rate of unemployment decreases in property values and the level of consumer confidence and consumer debt may substantially affect consumer loan levels and credit quality which in turn could impact client activity in all of our businesses these factors also may have an impact on our ability to achieve our strategic objectives declines and volatility in us and global market conditions such as that from covid19 have impacted our businesses in the past are impacting us now and may do so again our businesses have been and in the future may be adversely affected by us and global capital market and credit crises the repricing of credit risk equity market volatility and decline and stress or recession in the us and global economies generally each of our segments operates in these markets with exposure for us and our clients in securities loans derivatives alternative investments seed capital and other commitments it is difficult to predict when how long and to what extent the aforementioned adverse conditions will exist which of our markets products and businesses will be directly affected and to what extent our clients may seek to bring claims arising out of investment performance that is affected by these conditions as a result these factors could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations these factors will also impact client behavior market downturns stagnation and volatility may cause and have caused individual investors to limit or decrease their participation in global markets negatively impacting our retail business andor our product sales market conditions regulatory actions tax laws and our competitive industry environment are among the reasons current shareholders in our mutual funds oeics sicavs unit trusts and investment trusts contractholders in our annuity products and policyholders in our protection products may opt to withdraw cash values for those products or for certain protection products to reduce their withdrawal activity if we are unable to offer appropriate product alternatives which encourage customers to continue purchasing in the face of actual or perceived market volatility our sales and management fee revenues could decline downturns and volatility in markets including equity fixed income real estate infrastructure and other markets have had and may in the future have an adverse effect on the revenues and returns from our asset management services retail advisory accounts variable annuity contracts and banking products because the profitability of these products and services depends on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management declines in the markets will reduce our revenues because the value of the investment assets we manage will be reduced in addition a significant portion of our revenue is derived from investment management agreements with the columbia management family of mutual funds which are terminable on days notice although some contracts governing investment management services are subject to termination for failure to meet performance benchmarks institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us or our financial advisors at will or on relatively short notice further a number of the products and services we make available to our clients are those offered by third parties and negative perceptions of these financial products and services or the financial industry in general may impact the number of withdrawals and redemptions or reduce purchases made by our clients which would adversely impact the levels of our assets under management our clients can also reduce the aggregate amount of managed assets or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons including investment performance changes in prevailing interest rates changes in investment preferences or investment management strategy for example active or passive investing styles changes in our or our advisors reputation in the marketplace changes in client or relationship management loss of key investment management personnel and financial market performance this reduction in managed assets and the associated decrease in revenues and earnings could have a material adverse effect on our business most of our variable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum death benefits and guaranteed minimum withdrawal and accumulation benefits decline or volatility in equity andor bond markets could result in guaranteed minimum benefits being higher than what current account values would support which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations although we have hedged a portion of the guarantees for the variable annuity contracts to mitigate the financial loss of equity andor bond market declines or volatility there can be no assurance that such a decline or volatility would not materially impact the profitability of certain products or product lines or our financial condition or results of operations further the cost of hedging our liability for these guarantees has increased as a result of low interest rates and volatility in the equity markets as well as broadbased market and regulatorydriven changes in the collateral requirements of hedge trading counterparties in addition heightened volatility and the transition away from libor as a widely accepted interest rate reference creates greater uncertainty for future hedging effectiveness changes in interest rates and prolonged periods of low interest rates and even negative interest rates may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations certain of our insurance annuity investment products and banking products are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations inclusive of changes in credit spreads which could cause future impacts associated with such fluctuations to differ from our historical costs in addition interest rate fluctuations and impacts from volatility or low interest rates on changes in credit spreads could result in fluctuations in the valuation of certain minimum guaranteed benefits contained in some of our variable annuity products although we typically hedge to mitigate some of the effect of such fluctuations significant changes in interest rates or prolonged periods of low interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the profitability of certain products or product lines or our results of operations interest rate fluctuations also could have an adverse effect on the results of our investment portfolio during periods of declining market interest rates or stagnancy of low interest rates the interest we receive on variable interest rate investments decreases and we are forced to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in loweryielding highgrade instruments or in lowercredit instruments to maintain comparable returns issuers of certain callable fixed income securities also may decide to prepay their obligations in order to borrow at lower market rates which increases the risk that we may have to reinvest the cash proceeds of these securities in loweryielding or lowercredit instruments during these periods our spread may be reduced or could become negative primarily because some of our products have guaranteed minimum crediting rates due to the longterm nature of the liabilities associated with certain of our businesses such as long term care and universal life with secondary guarantees as well as fixed annuities and guaranteed benefits on variable annuities sustained declines in or stagnancy of low longterm interest rates may subject us to reinvestment risks and increased hedging costs in addition reduced or negative spreads may require us to accelerate amortization of deferred acquisition costs dac which would increase our expenses and reduce our net earnings in the period where we accelerate amortization of dac the pattern of dac amortization is impacted by the use of certain assumptions including interest margins mortality rates persistency rates maintenance expense levels and customer asset value growth rates for variable products we periodically review and where appropriate adjust our assumptions during periods of increasing market interest rates we may offer higher crediting rates on interestsensitive products such as universal life insurance fixed annuities and faceamount certificates and we may increase crediting rates on in force products to keep these products competitive which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations because yields on invested assets may not increase as quickly as current interest rates we may have to accept a lower spread and thus lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets in addition increases in market interest rates may cause increased policy surrenders withdrawals from life insurance policies and annuity contracts and requests for policy loans as policyholders and contractholders seek to shift assets to products with perceived higher returns this process may lead to an earlier than expected outflow of cash from our business these withdrawals and surrenders may require investment assets to be sold at a time when the prices of those assets are lower because of the increase in market interest rates which may result in investment losses also increases in market interest rates may result in extension of certain cash flows from structured mortgage assets an increase in policy surrenders and withdrawals also may require us to accelerate amortization of dac or other intangibles or cause an impairment of goodwill which would increase our expenses and reduce our net earnings in the period adverse capital and credit market conditions or a downgrade in our credit ratings may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs our access to capital and our cost of capital volatility uncertainty and disruption in the capital and credit markets may decrease available liquidity which we may need to pay our expenses and dividends if the market conditions hinder our availability to obtain capital our business could suffer our liquidity needs are satisfied primarily through our reserves and the cash generated by our operations we believe the level of cash and securities we maintain combined with expected cash inflows from investments and operations is adequate to meet anticipated shortterm and longterm payment obligations in the event current resources are insufficient to satisfy our needs we may access financing sources such as bank debt additional financing depends on a variety of factors such as market conditions the general availability of credit the volume of trading activities the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry our credit ratings and credit capacity actions by our regulators and perceptions held by shareholders customers or lenders further the financial strength ratings which various rating organizations publish as a measure of an insurance companys ability to meet contractholder and policyholder obligations are important to maintain public confidence in our products our competitive position and the ability to market our products any future downgrade in our financial strength ratings or the announced potential for a downgrade could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways including i reducing new sales of insurance and annuity products and investment products ii adversely affecting our relationships with our advisors and thirdparty distributors of our products iii materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contractholders and policyholders iv requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and services to remain competitive and v adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance or obtain reasonable pricing on reinsurance ratings agencies have and may continue to increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating organizations models for maintenance of ratings levels including adjusting the framework under which they view our companys business mix that drives these requirements or downgrade ratings applied to particular classes of securities or types of institutions and our ratings could be changed at any time and without any notice by the rating organizations market conditions or decisions by our ratings agencies that hinder our access to capital may limit our ability to satisfy statutory capital targets generate fee income and marketrelated revenue to meet liquidity needs and access the capital necessary to grow our business as such we may be forced to delay raising capital issue different types of capital than we would otherwise less effectively deploy such capital or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility business risks intense competition and the economics of changes in our product revenue mix and distribution channels could negatively impact our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability our businesses operate in intensely competitive industries including brokerdealers banks asset managers insurers and other financial institutions some of which have a larger market share more desirable technology less regulation or greater financial resources than we do furthermore our competitors may be better able to address trends structural changes or movement of assets resulting from industry changes in response to the uncertain regulatory environment in the us and around the world we could experience lower sales higher costs or other developments that could negatively impact our results of operations a drop in our investment performance as compared to that of our competitors could negatively impact our revenues and profitability investment performance is a key competitive factor for our retail and institutional asset management products and services strong investment performance helps to ensure the retention of our products and services by our clients and creates new sales of products and services it may also result in higher ratings by ratings services such as morningstar or lipper which may compound the foregoing effects strong investment performance and its effects are important elements to our stated goals of growing assets under management and greater economies of scale there can be no assurance as to how future investment performance will compare to our competitors or that historical performance will be indicative of future returns any drop or perceived drop in investment performance as compared to our competitors could cause a decline in sales of our mutual funds and other investment products an increase in redemptions and the termination of institutional asset management relationships these impacts may reduce our aggregate amount of assets under management and reduce management fees poor investment performance could also adversely affect our ability to expand the distribution of our products through unaffiliated third parties further any drop in market share of mutual funds sales by our advisors may further reduce profits as sales of other companies mutual funds are less profitable than sales of our proprietary funds we face intense competition in attracting and retaining key talent our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to attract and retain qualified people in a very competitive market we are dependent on our network of advisors to drive growth and results in our wealth management business and for a significant portion of the sales of our products and the recruiting environment for financial advisors is highly competitive in addition the investment performance of our asset management products and services and the retention of our products and services by our clients are dependent upon the strategies and decisions of our portfolio managers and analysts from time to time there are regulatorydriven or other trends and developments within the industry such as changes around the protocol for broker recruiting that could potentially impact the dynamics between us and our competitors if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our recruiting and retention costs increase significantly our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted the impairment negative performance or default by other financial institutions or other third parties could adversely affect us we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokerdealers commercial banks investment banks hedge funds insurers reinsurers investment funds and other institutions the operations of us and global financial services institutions are interconnected and a decline in the financial condition of one or more financial services institutions may expose us to credit losses or defaults limit our access to liquidity or otherwise disrupt the operations of our businesses while we regularly assess our exposure to different industries and counterparties the performance and financial strength of specific institutions are subject to rapid change the timing and extent of which cannot be known many transactions with and investments in the products and securities of other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty with respect to secured transactions our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure we also have exposure to financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments derivative transactions including with respect to derivatives hedging our exposure on variable annuity contracts with guaranteed benefits reinsurance repurchase and underwriting arrangements and equity investments any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of these assets could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations issuers of the fixed maturity securities that we own may default on principal and interest payments some of our fixed maturity securities may have ratings below investmentgrade defaultrelated declines in the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio or consumer credit holdings could cause our net earnings to decline and could also cause us to contribute capital to some of our regulated subsidiaries which may require us to obtain funding during periods of unfavorable market conditions capital and credit market volatility can exacerbate and has exacerbated the risk of thirdparty defaults bankruptcy filings foreclosures legal actions and other events that may limit the value of or restrict our access and our clients access to cash and investments although we are not required to do so we have elected in the past and we may elect in the future to compensate clients for losses incurred in response to such events provide clients with temporary credit or liquidity or other support related to products that we manage or provide credit liquidity or other support to the financial products we manage if we elect to provide additional support we could incur losses from the support we provide and incur additional costs including financing costs in connection with the support these losses and additional costs could be material and could adversely impact our results of operations if we were to take such actions we may also restrict or otherwise utilize our corporate assets limiting our flexibility to use these assets for other purposes and may be required to raise additional capital we may not be able to maintain our unaffiliated thirdparty distribution channels and the sale of unaffiliated products may diminish sales of our own products we distribute certain of our investment products through unaffiliated thirdparty advisors and financial institutions maintaining and deepening relationships with these unaffiliated distributors is an important part of our growth strategy as strong thirdparty distribution arrangements enhance our ability to market our products and to increase our assets under management revenues and profitability access to distribution channels is subject to intense competition due to the large number of competitors and products in the investment advisory and annuities industries as well as regulatory and consumer trends driving escalating compliance disclosure and risk management requirements for distributors relationships with our distributors are subject to periodic negotiation that may result in increased distribution costs andor reductions in the amount of our products marketed as a result there can be no assurance that the distribution relationships we have established will continue any such reduction in access to thirdparty distributors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products and to generate revenue in our asset management segments further any increase in the costs to distribute our products or reduction in the type or amount of products made available for sale may have a material effect on our revenues and profitability the sale of thirdparty products to our clients and additional openings of our advisor network to products of unaffiliated insurance companies and asset managers may lower sales of our companies own products lead to higher surrenders or redemptions or other developments which might not be fully offset by higher distribution revenues or other benefits possibly resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operations our valuation of fixed maturity and equity securities may include methodologies estimations and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition fixed maturity equity trading securities and shortterm investments which are reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets represent the majority of our total cash and invested assets the determination of fair values by management in the absence of quoted market prices is based on valuation methodologies securities we deem to be comparable and assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances the fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty factors considered in estimating fair value include coupon rate maturity estimated duration call provisions sinking fund requirements credit rating industry sector of the issuer current interest rates and credit spreads and quoted market prices of comparable securities the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts during periods of market disruption including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates and rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity it may be difficult to value certain of our securities there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment in such cases the valuation of certain securities may require additional subjectivity and management judgment as such valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable and may require greater estimation as well as valuation methods that are more sophisticated which may result in values less than the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold further rapidly changing and unexpected credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the periodtoperiod changes in value could vary significantly decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition the determination of the amount of allowances taken on certain loans and investments is subject to managements evaluation and judgment and could materially impact our results of operations or financial position the determination of the amount of allowances vary by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of inherent and known risks associated with the respective asset class management uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery inherent in managements evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential the determination of the amount of allowances on loans is based upon the assets expected life considering past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances some of our investments are relatively illiquid we invest a portion of our owned assets in certain privately placed fixed income securities mortgage loans and limited partnership interests all of which are relatively illiquid these asset classes represented of the carrying value of our investment portfolio as of december if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of our normal cash requirements we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them for an amount less than we would otherwise have been able to realize or both which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the elimination of libor may adversely affect the interest rates on and value of certain derivatives and floating rate securities we hold the activities we conduct and any other assets or liabilities the value of which is tied to libor the elimination of libor and transition to alternative reference rates may have an adverse impact on the value of return on and trading markets for a broad array of financial products including any liborbased securities loans and derivatives that are included in our financial assets and liabilities us dollar libor is anticipated to be phased out by june and replaced by the secured overnight financing rate and all other libor currencies are anticipated to be phased out by december there will be significant work required to transition to the new benchmark rates and implement necessary changes to our systems processes and models this may impact our existing transaction data products systems operations valuation and financial risk management processes in addition libor may perform differently during the phaseout period than in the past which could result in lower interest payments and a reduction in the value of certain assets accordingly it is difficult to predict the full impact of the transition away from libor on various derivatives floating rate securities and other securities we hold the activities we conduct in our various businesses and any other assets or liabilities as well as contractual rights and obligations the value of which is tied to libor the value or profitability of these products and instruments and our costs of operations may be adversely affected until new reference rates and fallbacks for both legacy and new products instruments and contracts are commercially accepted insurance risks the failure of other insurers could require us to pay higher assessments to state insurance guaranty funds our insurance companies are required by law to be members of the guaranty fund association in every state where they are licensed to do business in the event of insolvency of one or more unaffiliated insurance companies our insurance companies could be adversely affected by the requirement to pay assessments to the guaranty fund associations uncertainty and volatility in the us economy and financial markets in recent years plus the repercussions of a heightened regulatory environment have weakened or may weaken the financial condition of numerous insurers including insurers currently in receiverships increasing the risk of triggering guaranty fund assessments if the counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements default or otherwise fail to fulfill their obligations we may be exposed to risks we had sought to mitigate which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we use reinsurance to mitigate certain of our risks reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders and contractholders even when the reinsurer is liable to us accordingly we bear credit and performance risk with respect to our reinsurers including commonwealth annuity and life insurance company and genworth life insurance company in july we finalized various confidential enhancements with genworth life insurance company that have been shared in the normal course of regular reviews with our domiciliary regulators and rating agencies a reinsurers insolvency or its inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of our reinsurance agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations if our reserves for future policy benefits and claims or for future certificate redemptions and maturities are inadequate we may be required to increase our reserve liabilities which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition we establish reserves as estimates of our liabilities to provide for future obligations under our insurance policies annuities and investment certificate contracts reserves do not represent an exact calculation of the liability but rather are estimates of contract benefits and related expenses we expect to incur over time the assumptions and estimates we make in establishing reserves require certain judgments about future experience and therefore are inherently uncertain we cannot determine with precision the actual amounts that we will pay for contract benefits the timing of payments or whether the assets supporting our stated reserves will increase to the levels we estimate before payment of benefits or claims we monitor our reserve levels continually if we were to conclude that our reserves are insufficient to cover actual or expected contract benefits we would be required to increase our reserves and incur income statement charges for the period in which we make the determination which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our insurance profitability relies on our assumptions including those regarding morbidity rates mortality rates and benefit utilization as well as the future persistency of our insurance policies and annuity contracts we set prices for riversource life disability insurance and historically ltc insurance as well as some annuity products based upon expected claim payment patterns derived from assumptions we make about our policyholders and contractholders including expenses fees investment returns and morbidity and mortality rates the longterm profitability of these products depends upon how our actual experience compares with our pricing assumptions actual experience can differ from our assumptions for many reasons over the time an insurance product is held and it remains to be seen how the covid19 pandemic will impact our assumptions if mortality rates are higher than our pricing assumptions we could be required to make greater payments under our life insurance policies and annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum death benefits than we have projected the prices and profitability of our life insurance and deferred annuity products are based in part upon assumptions related to persistency the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force from one period to the next for most of our life insurance and deferred annuity products actual persistency that is lower than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse impact on profitability especially in the early years of a policy or contract because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy or contract for our ltc insurance and universal life insurance policies with secondary guarantees as well as variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits actual persistency that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have a negative impact on profitability if these policies remain in force longer than we assumed we could be required to make greater benefit payments than we had anticipated when we priced or partially reinsured these products the risk that our claims experience may differ significantly from our pricing assumptions is particularly significant for our ltc insurance products notwithstanding our ability to implement future price increases with regulatory approvals though we discontinued offering ltc products in ltc insurance policies provide for longduration coverage and therefore our actual claims experience will emerge over many years our ability to forecast future claim rates for ltc insurance is more limited than life insurance we have sought to moderate these uncertainties to some extent by partially reinsuring ltc policies at the time the policies were underwritten and limiting our present standalone ltc insurance offerings to policies underwritten fully by unaffiliated thirdparty insurers and we have also implemented rate increases and provided reduced benefit options on certain in force policies because our assumptions regarding persistency experience are inherently uncertain reserves for future policy benefits and claims may prove to be inadequate if actual persistency experience is different from those assumptions although some of our products permit us to increase premiums during the life of the policy or contract we cannot guarantee that these increases would be sufficient to maintain profitability additionally some of these pricing changes require regulatory approval which may not be forthcoming moreover many of our products do not permit us to increase premiums or limit those increases during the life of the policy or contract while premiums on certain other products primarily ltc insurance may not be increased without prior regulatory approval significant deviations in experience from pricing expectations regarding persistency could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products operations risks a failure to protect our reputation could adversely affect our businesses our reputation is one of our most important assets our ability to attract and retain customers investors employees and advisors is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our company damage to our reputation could cause significant harm to our business and prospects reputational damage may arise from numerous sources including litigation or regulatory actions failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality compliance failures any perceived or actual weakness in our financial strength or liquidity clients or potential clients perceived failure of how we address certain political social or environmental topics technological cybersecurity or other security breaches including attempted or inadvertent breaches resulting in improper disclosure of client or employee personal information unethical or improper behavior and the misconduct or error of our employees advisors and counterparties additionally a failure to develop new products and services or successfully manage associated operational risks could harm our reputation and potentially expose us to additional costs or negative public relations or social media campaigns any negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social media publicity governmental investigations or litigation adverse developments with respect to our industry may also by association negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us misconduct by our employees and advisors may be difficult to detect and deter and may damage our reputation misconduct or errors by our employees and advisors could result in violations of law regulatory sanctions andor serious reputational or financial harm misconduct or errors can occur in each of our businesses we cannot always deter misconduct by our employees and advisors and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases preventing and detecting misconduct among our franchisee advisors who are not employees of our company presents additional challenges and could have an adverse effect on our business our reputation depends on our continued identification of and mitigation against conflicts of interest we have procedures and controls that are designed to identify address and appropriately disclose perceived conflicts of interest though our reputation could be damaged if we fail or appear to fail to address conflicts of interest appropriately in addition the sec and other federal and state regulators as well as foreign regulators have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest it is possible that potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions also it is possible that the regulatory scrutiny of and litigation in connection with conflicts of interest will make our clients less willing to enter into transactions in which such a conflict may occur which would adversely affect our businesses our operational systems and networks as well as those of our franchise advisors are subject to evolving cybersecurity or other technological risks which could result in the disclosure of confidential information loss of our proprietary information damage to our reputation additional costs to us regulatory penalties and other adverse impacts our business is reliant upon internal and thirdpartycontrolled and operated technology systems and networks to process transmit and store information including our clients and advisors personal information as well as our proprietary information and to conduct many of our business activities and transactions maintaining the security and integrity of this information and these systems and networks and appropriately responding to any cybersecurity and privacy incidents including attempts is critical to the success of our business operations including our reputation the retention of our advisors and clients and to the protection of our proprietary information and our clients personal information to date we have not experienced any material breaches of or interference with our centrally controlled systems and networks however we routinely face and address such evolving threats and have been able to detect and respond to these incidents to date without a material loss of client financial assets or information through the use of ongoing monitoring and continual improvement of our security capabilities and incident response manual we and our advisors as well as our service providers have also been threatened by phishing and spear phishing scams social engineering attacks account takeovers introductions of malware attempts at electronic breakins and the submission of fraudulent payment requests the number of attempted phishing attacks has increased substantially every year which is expected to continue attempted or successful breaches or interference by third parties or by insiders that may occur in the future could have a material adverse impact on our business reputation financial condition or results of operations on a corporate basis various regulations and in some cases contractual obligations require us to establish and maintain corporate policies and technical and operational measures designed to protect sensitive client employee contractor and vendor information and to respond to cybersecurity incidents we have established policies and implemented such technical and operational measures ourselves and have in place policies that require our franchisee advisors who control locally their own technology operations to do the same changes in our business or technological advancements may also require corresponding changes in our systems networks and data security and response measures while accessing our products and services our customers may use computers and other devices that sit outside of our security control environment in addition the everincreasing reliance on technology systems and networks and the occurrence and potential adverse impact of attacks on such systems and networks including in recent wellpublicized security breaches at other companies both generally and in the financial services industry have enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cybersecurity threats as these threats and government and regulatory oversight of associated risks continue to evolve we may be required to expend additional resources to enhance or expand upon the technical and operational security and response measures we currently maintain or that we allow franchise advisors to maintain and control locally despite the measures we have taken and may in the future take to address and mitigate cybersecurity privacy and technology risks we cannot be certain that our systems and networks will not be subject to successful attacks breaches or interference nor can we be certain that franchise advisors will comply with our policies and procedures in this regard or that clients will engage in safe online practices furthermore human error occurs from time to time and such mistakes can lead to the inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information any such event may result in operational disruptions as well as unauthorized access to or the disclosure or loss of our proprietary information or client employee vendor or advisor personal information which in turn may result in legal claims regulatory scrutiny and liability reputational damage the incurrence of costs to respond to eliminate or mitigate further exposure the loss of clients or advisors or other damage to our business while we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both thirdparty liability and firstparty liability coverages it may not protect us against all cybersecurityrelated losses furthermore we may be subject to indemnification costs and liability to third parties if we breach any confidentiality or security obligations regarding vendor data or for losses related to the data in addition the trend toward broad consumer and generalpublic notification of such incidents could exacerbate the harm to our business reputation financial condition or results of operations in the event of a breach even if we successfully protect our technology infrastructure and the confidentiality of sensitive data and conduct appropriate incident response we may incur significant expenses in connection with our responses to any such attacks as well as the adoption implementation and maintenance of appropriate security measures in addition our regulators may seek to hold our company responsible for the acts mistakes or omissions of our franchise advisors even where they procure and control much of the physical office space and technology infrastructure they use to operate their businesses locally protection from system interruptions and operating errors is important to our business if we experience a sustained interruption to our telecommunications or data processing systems or other failure in operational execution it could harm our business operating errors and system or network interruptions could delay and disrupt our operations interruptions could be caused by mistake or other operational failures by service provider staff employee or advisor error or malfeasance interference by third parties including hackers our implementation of new technology or maintenance of existing technology our financial accounting data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate or report data properly experience connectivity disruptions or otherwise become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control adversely affecting our ability to process transactions or provide products and services to our clients further we cannot control the execution of any business continuity or incident response plans implemented by our service providers or our franchise advisors we rely on thirdparty service providers and vendors for certain communications technology and business functions and other services and we face the risk of their operational failure including without limitation failure caused by an inaccuracy untimeliness or other deficiency in data reporting technical or security failures termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents exchanges clearing houses or other thirdparty service providers that we use to facilitate or are component providers to our securities transactions and other product manufacturing and distribution activities these risks are heightened by our deployment in response to both investor interest and evolution in the financial markets of increasingly sophisticated products any such failure termination or constraint or flawed execution or response could adversely impact our ability to effect transactions service our clients manage our exposure to risk or otherwise achieve desired outcomes risk management policies and procedures may not be fully effective in identifying or mitigating risk exposure in all market environments new products vendors or against all types of risk including employee and financial advisor misconduct our policies and procedures to identify monitor and manage risks may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk many of our methods of managing risk and the associated exposures are based upon our use of observed historical experience or expectations about future experience eg market behavior clientpolicyholder behavior mortality etc or statistics based on historical models experience may not emerge as expected and during periods of market volatility or due to unforeseen events the historicallyderived experience and correlations may not be valid as a result these methods and models may not predict future exposures accurately which could be significantly greater than what our models indicate further some controls are manual and are subject to inherent limitations this could cause us to incur investment losses or cause our hedging and other risk management strategies to be ineffective other risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets clients catastrophe occurrence or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible to us which may not always be accurate complete uptodate or properly evaluated our financial performance also requires us to develop effectively manage and market new products and services that appropriately anticipate or respond to changes in the industry and evolving client demands the development and introduction of new products and services including the creation of asset management products with a focus on environmental social and governance matters require continued innovative effort and may require significant time resources and ongoing support substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures shifting client and market preferences the introduction of competing products or services and compliance with regulatory requirements management of operational legal and regulatory risks requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk including those associated with our key vendors insurance and other traditional riskshifting tools may be held by or available to us in order to manage certain exposures but they are subject to terms such as deductibles coinsurance limits and policy exclusions as well as risk of counterparty denial of coverage default or insolvency as a holding company we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us to pay dividends and to meet our obligations we act as a holding company for our subsidiaries through which substantially all of our operations are conducted dividends from our subsidiaries and permitted payments to us under our intercompany arrangements with our subsidiaries are our principal sources of cash to pay shareholder dividends and to meet our other financial obligations these obligations include our operating expenses and interest and principal on our borrowings if the cash we receive from our subsidiaries pursuant to dividend payment and intercompany arrangements is insufficient for us to fund any of these obligations we may be required to raise cash through the incurrence of additional debt the issuance of additional equity or the sale of assets if any of this happens it could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations insurance banking and securities laws and regulations including the frbs proposal for a new capital framework for islhcs termed the building block approach and the naics group capital calculation represents an insurancefocused capital framework may regulate the ability of many of our subsidiaries such as our insurance banking and brokerage subsidiaries and our faceamount certificate company to pay dividends or make other permitted payments additionally the rating organizations effectively impose various capital requirements on our company and our insurance company subsidiaries in order for us to maintain our ratings and the ratings of our insurance subsidiaries we must manage our business within the expectations of the patchwork of regulations and capital expectations from these parties as asset values decline or other financial drivers to our business worsen our and our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or make other permitted payments can be reduced additionally the various asset classes held by our subsidiaries and used in determining required capital levels are weighted differently or are restricted as to the proportion in which they may be held depending upon their liquidity credit risk and other factors the regulatory capital requirements and dividendpaying ability of our subsidiaries may also be affected by a change in the mix of products sold by such subsidiaries further the capital requirements imposed upon our subsidiaries may be impacted by heightened regulatory or rating organization scrutiny and intervention which could negatively affect our and our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or make other permitted payments additionally in the past we have found it necessary and advisable to provide support to certain of our subsidiaries in order to maintain adequate capital for regulatory or other purposes and we may provide such support in the future the provision of such support could adversely affect our excess capital liquidity and the dividends or other permitted payments received from our subsidiaries the operation of our business in foreign markets and our investments in nonus denominated securities and investment products subjects us to exchange rate and other risks in connection with international operations and earnings and income generated overseas while we are a usbased company a portion of our business operations occurs outside of the us and some of our investments are not denominated in us dollars as a result we are exposed to certain foreign currency exchange risks that could reduce us dollar equivalent earnings as well as negatively impact our general account and other proprietary investment portfolios appreciation of the us dollar could unfavorably affect net income from foreign operations the value of nonus dollar denominated investments and investments in foreign subsidiaries in comparison depreciation of the us dollar could positively affect our net income from foreign operations and the value of nonus dollar denominated investments though such depreciation could also diminish investor creditor and rating organizations perceptions of our company compared to peer companies that have a relatively greater proportion of foreign operations or investments in addition conducting and increasing our international operations subjects us to new risks that generally we have not faced in the us including i potentially adverse tax consequences including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings ii the localization of our solutions and related costs iii the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and different legal standards including laws and regulations and iv social and economic situations outside of the us the occurrence of any one of these risks could negatively affect our international business and consequently our results of operations generally additionally operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources and we cannot be certain these operations will produce desired levels of revenues or profitability in particular the full impact of brexit remains uncertain the impact of brexit in the near and longterm is still unknown and could have additional adverse effects on economies financial markets currencies and asset valuations around the world including the value of the columbia threadneedle investments funds portfolio investments the occurrence of natural or manmade disasters and catastrophes could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition the occurrence of natural disasters and catastrophes including earthquakes hurricanes floods tornadoes fires blackouts severe winter weather explosions pandemic disease such as covid19 and manmade disasters including acts of terrorism riots civil unrest including largescale protests insurrections and military actions could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition such disasters and catastrophes may damage our facilities preventing our service providers employees and financial advisors from performing their roles or otherwise disturbing our ordinary business operations and by impacting insurance claims as described below these impacts could be particularly severe to the extent they affect access to physical facilities the physical wellbeing of large numbers of our employees our computerbased data processing transmission storage and retrieval systems and destroy or release valuable data such disasters and catastrophes may also impact us indirectly by changing the condition and behaviors of our customers business counterparties and regulators as well as by causing declines or volatility in the economic and financial markets the potential effects of natural and manmade disasters and catastrophes on certain of our businesses include but are not limited to the following i a catastrophic loss of life may materially increase the amount of or accelerate the timing in which benefits are paid under our insurance policies ii an increase in claims and any resulting increase in claims reserves caused by a disaster may harm the financial condition of our reinsurers thereby impacting the cost and availability of reinsurance and the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries iii widespread unavailability of staff and iv declines and volatility in the financial markets that may decrease the value of our assets under management and administration which could harm our financial condition and reduce our management fees legal regulatory and tax risks legal and regulatory actions are inherent in our businesses and could result in financial losses or harm our businesses we are and in the future may be subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of our operations both domestically and internationally actions brought against us may result in awards settlements penalties injunctions or other adverse results including reputational damage in addition we may incur significant expenses in connection with our defense against such actions regardless of their outcome various regulatory and governmental bodies have the authority to review our products and business practices and those of our employees and independent financial advisors and to bring regulatory or other legal actions against us if in their view our practices or those of our employees or advisors are improper pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings relating to aspects of our businesses and operations that are specific to us and proceedings that are typical of the industries and businesses in which we operate some of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of complainants our businesses are regulated heavily and changes to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses may have an adverse effect on our operations reputation and financial condition virtually all aspects of our business including the activities of our parent company and our various subsidiaries are subject to various federal state and international laws and regulations for a discussion of the regulatory framework in which we operate see business regulation included in part i item of this annual report on form 10k compliance with these applicable laws and regulations is timeconsuming and personnelintensive and we have invested and will continue to invest substantial resources to ensure compliance by our parent company and our subsidiaries directors officers employees registered representatives and agents further any future legislation or changes to the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses as well as changes to the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations may affect our operations and financial condition legislation could require changes to our business operations or our regulatory reporting relationships such changes may impact our business operations and profitability increase our costs of doing business increase compliance costs as well as have a material effect on fee rates interest rates and foreign exchange rates which could materially impact our products services investments results of operations products and liquidity in ways that we cannot predict ongoing changes to regulation and oversight of the financial industry may produce results the full impact of which cannot be immediately ascertained as government intervention could distort customary and expected commercial behavior certain examples of legislative and regulatory changes that may impact our businesses are described below some of the changes could present operational challenges and increase costs ultimately the complexities and increased costs of legislative and regulatory changes could have an impact on our ability to offer costeffective and innovative products to our clients regulation of products and services any mandated reductions or restructuring of the fees we charge for our products and services resulting from regulatory initiatives or proceedings could reduce our revenues andor earnings for example the dol could propose changes to regulations that define our advisors relationships with their clients such as requiring a fiduciary relationship between our advisors and clients insurance regulation changes in the state regulatory requirements applicable to our insurance companies that are made for the benefit of the consumer sometimes lead to additional expense for the insurer and thus could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations further we cannot predict the effect that proposed federal legislation may have on our businesses or competitors such as the option of federally chartered insurers a mandated federal systemic risk regulator future initiatives of the fio within the department of the treasury or by any of the domiciliary regulators the naic or the international association of insurance supervisors with respect to insurance holding company supervision capital standards or systemic risk regulation as discussed earlier the naics group capital calculation and the frbs proposal for a new capital framework for islhcs would create new capital requirements even if there are any refinements to the proposal which could potentially impact the way we structure our capital or manage our business international regulation potential measures taken by foreign and international authorities regarding antibribery the nationalization or expropriation of assets the imposition of limits on foreign ownership of local companies increased environmental sustainability or governance requirements changes in laws including tax laws and regulations and in their application or interpretation imposition of large fines political instability dividend limitations price controls changes in applicable currency currency exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold to us dollars or other currencies may negatively affect our business employment regulation a portion of our advisor force consists of independent contractors legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our industry and our relationships with our advisors their staff and our business resulting in an adverse effect on our results or operations privacy and data our business is subject to comprehensive legal requirements concerning the use and protection of personal information including client and employee information from a multitude of different functional regulators and law enforcement bodies this regulatory framework is rapidly changing through an everincreasing patchwork of state laws and regulation and international developments like gdpr further developments could negatively impact our business and operations as a savings and loan holding company we are subject to supervision by the frb and various prudential standards that may limit our activities and strategies ameriprise financial is subject to ongoing supervision by the frb including supervision and prudential standards certain capital requirements stresstesting resolution planning information security and privacy and certain risk management requirements further as a financial holding company our activities are limited to those that are financial in nature incidental to a financial activity or with frb approval complementary to a financial activity our brokerdealers and bank subsidiary are limited in their ability to lend or transact with affiliates and are subject to minimum regulatory capital and other requirements as well as limitations on their ability to use funds deposited with them in brokerage or bank accounts to fund their businesses these requirements may hinder our ability to access funds from our subsidiaries we may also become subject to a prohibition or limitations on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock the federal banking regulators including the occ the frb and the fdic as well as the sec through finra have the authority and under certain circumstances the obligation to limit or prohibit dividend payments and stock repurchases by the banking organizations they supervise including ameriprise and its bank subsidiaries any changes to regulations or changes to the supervisory approach may also result in increased compliance costs to the extent we are required to modify our existing compliance policies procedures and practices compliance with bank holding company laws and regulations including the volcker rule impacts the structure and availability of certain of our products and services and our costs in providing those products and services costs of compliance may be driven by how these laws and regulations and the scale of ameriprise bank evolves over the course of time failure to meet one or more of these requirements could depending on the violation limit ameriprises ability to undertake new activities continue certain activities or make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies execution of our business strategies also may require certain regulatory approvals or consents which may include approvals of the frb and other domestic and nonus regulatory authorities these regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies which may impact negatively our ability to realize fully the expected benefits of certain opportunities changes in corporate tax laws and regulations and changes in the interpretation of such laws and regulations as well as adverse determinations regarding the application of such laws and regulations could adversely affect our earnings and could make some of our products less attractive to clients we are subject to the income tax laws of the us its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions in addition changes to the internal revenue code administrative rulings or court decisions could increase our provision for income taxes and reduce our earnings many of the products we issue or on which our businesses are based including both insurance products and noninsurance products receive favorable treatment under current us federal income or estate tax law changes in us federal income or estate tax law could reduce or eliminate the tax advantages of certain of our products and thus make such products less attractive to clients or cause a change in client demand and activity we may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims we rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright trademark patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property or attempt to use the same to defraud others we may have to litigate to enforce and protect our brand and reputation copyrights trademarks patents trade secrets and knowhow or to determine their scope validity or enforceability which represents a diversion of resources that may be significant in amount and may not prove successful the loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete we also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon or constitute misappropriation of such other partys intellectual property rights third parties may have or may eventually be issued patents or other protections that could be infringed by our products methods processes or services or could otherwise limit our ability to offer certain product features any party that holds such a patent could make a claim of infringement against us the threat of patent litigation from nonpracticing entities is increasing for financial services firms like ours we have successfully resolved all such cases to date but may not always be able to do so without significant financial impact we may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright trademark license usage rights or misappropriation of trade secret rights any such claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant liability for damages if we were found to have infringed or misappropriated a thirdparty patent or other intellectual property rights we could incur substantial liability and in some circumstances could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers or utilizing and benefiting from certain methods processes copyrights trademarks trade secrets or licenses or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition changes in and the adoption of accounting standards could have a material impact on our financial statements our accounting policies are fundamental to how we record and report our results of operations and financial condition we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the financial accounting standards board fasb the sec and other regulators often change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements these changes are sometimes difficult to predict and could impose additional governance internal control and disclosure demands in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in our restating prior period financial statements as an example in august the fasb updated the accounting standard related to longduration insurance and annuity contracts that will be effective january that is expected to result in significant changes to how we account for and report our insurance and annuity contracts both inforce and new business including updating assumptions used to measure the liability for future policy benefits for traditional and limitedpayment contracts measurement of market risk benefits and amortization of dac it is possible that accounting changes could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition
