benefiting from the strategic investments weve been making to deliver a differentiated client advisor experience built on advice weve been on a multiyear journey to take our client experience to the

capabilities are fully integrated within their technology ecosystem one of our more significant investments our crm platform is increasingly serving as the hub for advisors allowing them to collaborate with clients while driving efficiencies and weve seen good uptake as advisors integrate these capabilities into their practices this strong engagement is helping to drive good client activity excellent flows and new client acquisition as we continue to build on our momentum from last year our total client net flows were strong at billion in the quarter with total client assets up to billion our investment advisory business continues to grow nicely in the quarter wrap net inflows were more than billion up over last year this is another record for us and reinforces our excellent

continue to build out the ameriprise bank where total assets grew to billion in the quarter as we discussed we plan to move additional deposits to the bank over the course of this year pledge and margin loan volumes increased nicely in the quarter as our advisors engaged with their clients with our lending solutions from a liquidity perspective wrapping up awm even with interest rates at alltime lows awm margin increased basis points sequentially ending the quarter at a strong turning to our retirement protection solutions business were off to a good start and continue to adapt to the low interest rate environment we have been very proactive in this climate as we serve client needs and prudently manage the business variable annuity sales increased nicely up driven by our success of structured product as well as our annuities without living benefits as a result the percentage of va sales without living benefits grew to of total sales in the quarter with regard to insurance our focus has been on our flagship vul product rather than iul in fact vul sales were up were focused on making sure we have the right product for this rate environment while maintaining strong underwriting ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 overall i feel good about how the retirement protection solutions business is performing in this challenging environment as part of this strategy we are actively pursuing a reinsurance transaction for the remaining closed block of fixed annuities and we feel we can execute it in the near term turning to asset management were generating strong results our team is engaged serving clients evolving needs well and driving profitable growth ill speak to the strength of the quarter and then comment on bmos emea acquisition with the continuation of positive flows in markets assets under management were up significantly increasing to billion were investing in the business including in transforming how we use data this is both within investments in terms of our use of data in our research as well as in distribution in addition and also key is the thought leadership we provide and how we are targeting the right advisors to drive meaningful engagement regarding investment performance our teams consistently generate strong performance for our clients its across all categories equities fixed income and asset allocation strategies as an active manager our research expertise is a key differentiator id highlight the columbia threadneedle ranked in the top over the one five and 10year time frames in the recent barrons best fund family ranking one of only two firms that ranked in the top across all time periods we also won seven refinitiv lipper fund awards in the us this year and over awards in emea over the last year this level of performance bodes very well in terms of earning future flows at quarter end columbia threadneedle had four and fivestar morningstar rated funds globally which represented close to of our assets this shows the breadth and strength of our product lineup so with this type of investment performance and the strong execution of our plan you saw that flows continue to be quite strong in the quarter we had net inflows of billion an improvement of billion from a year ago excluding legacy insurance partner outflows net inflows were billion global retail net inflows were billion largely driven by the traction were seeing in north america were driving high engagement with clients and intermediaries including with the larger broker dealers and independents sales and flows traction is broad and were working hard to maintain that in the quarter we had nine funds that generated over million in net inflows including five equity and four fixed income funds in emea weve seen good flows in continental europe in a number of key markets in the uk we remained in outflows however we saw improvement in the quarter as the economy started to reopen there more fully and were hopeful that investor settlement will strengthen in terms of global institutional we had net inflows of billion ex legacy partner outflows driven by our results in emea weve made considerable progress in strengthening our consultant relations and client service globally consultants have increased their ratings on a number of key strategies in recent quarters this is important in terms of our ability to gain additional mandates from existing clients and grow our sales pipeline ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 as you saw earlier this month we announced our strategic acquisition of bmos emea asset management business the acquisition is right in line with our strategy that we consistently discussed with you it will add complementary capabilities and solutions with their established strengths in responsible investing liability driven investing fiduciary outsource management and european real estate it will also expand our scale in other traditional asset classes especially in european fixed income and recent flow trends in their emea business have been favorable in addition post close bmos north american wealth management clients will have the opportunity to access a broad range of columbia threadneedle investment management solutions from an asset management perspective we gain important geographic diversity upon close emeas aum will increase significantly to of total aum at columbia threadneedle which provides a good balance to the us business weve always been a disciplined acquirer and we expect this transaction will add to our strategic growth and generate a good return over time importantly as we execute it the team will remain focused on maintaining our strong business momentum so for ameriprise overall were in an excellent position the business is performing really well and delivering strong results based on the current environment we feel comfortable that well continue to

financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc thank you jim ameriprise delivered a strong quarter of financial results and excellent business metrics which are a direct result of our continued execution of the strategic priorities we continued to demonstrate strong performance in our core growth businesses of advice wealth management and asset management driven by ongoing organic growth and expense discipline at the core we remain focused on accelerating our mix shift through specific actions for example our recently announced strategic acquisition of bmos emea asset management business will expand key capabilities in attractive and growing market segments while also adding to traditional asset classes this provides a larger combined capability to meet client needs we have high confidence in the financial benefits from the acquisition as well it will be accretive on our cash and operating basis by generating a 20plus irr and have a payback period consistent with the columbia acquisition of eight years in addition we have established a strong partnership with bmo in north america which we expect to generate strong profits we are actively engaged in a fixed annuity reinsurance process and anticipate finalizing the transaction shortly lastly we continue to effectively manage our risk profile and continued profit mix shift to lower risk and higher margin retirement and protection solution offerings our diversified model continues to generate robust free cash ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 flow and strong balance sheet fundamentals we remain on track to return approximately of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders in lets turn to slide ameriprises strong underlying business performance and activity levels in our core growth businesses continue to neutralize headwinds from short term interest rates as a reminder this will be the last quarter where we have a reduction in short rates distorting the yearoveryear comparison excluding the impact from interest ameriprise adjusted net operating revenue grew advice wealth management and asset management businesses profitability continues to increase with adjusted pretax operating earnings up general and administrative expenses continue to be wellmanaged excluding the impact of share price appreciation on compensation ga expenses were up as we remain disciplined executing reengineering initiatives in total we delivered excellent underlying eps growth of excluding the net operating loss tax benefit and very strong margins in the quarter turning to slide as jim mentioned advice wealth management continued to deliver excellent organic growth during the quarter with total client assets up to billion in response to the request from many of you we are now disclosing total client flows which increased to billion from a product perspective we had a terrific growth in our wrap flows up to billion cash balances remain elevated at billion with a substantial opportunity for clients to put cash back to work in the future on page financial results in advice wealth management were strong with underlying adjusted operating earnings up to million after the million interest rate headwind adjusted operating net revenues were up to billion driven by client flows improved transaction activity and higher market levels on a sequential basis revenues increased from strong performance despite fewer fee days in the current quarter expenses remain wellmanaged and we continue to exhibit strong expense discipline ga expense increased only and included higher volume related expenses bank expansion investments for future growth and elevated share based compensation pretax adjusted operating margin was adjusting for interest rates the margin would have been basis points higher on a sequential basis pretax operating earnings increased and pretax adjusted operating margin expanded basis points turning to page the significant growth in asset management was due to our investment engine that is driving revenue growth through consistent investment performance and compelling thought leadership leading to increased client engagement net inflows in the quarter were billion excluding legacy insurance partners an billion improvement from a year ago adjusted operating revenues increased to million reflecting cumulative benefit of inflows favorable mix shift toward equity strategies and market appreciation the prior year quarter included an unfavorable impact from our performance fee adjustment ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 general and administrative expenses grew from higher compensation expense related to strong performance ameriprise share appreciation as well as the costs associated with increased activity levels adjusted for compensation related expense ga increased a more moderate putting this together pretax adjusted operating earnings grew with a margin we continue to be very encouraged by the continuation of positive flow trends and strong profitability lets turn to page retirement protection solutions continue to perform in line with expectation in this market and rate environment while we have a strong book of business from a risk perspective we continue to execute our strategy to improve it further in the quarter of retirement product sales did not have living benefit guarantees this sales shift is already having an impact on our inforce block with the account value of living benefit riders down from to in protection sales were flat as we continue to see a meaningful increase in higher margin vul and a significant decline in index universal life these mix shifts are expected to continue going forward financial results continue to be in line with expectations pretax adjusted operating earnings increased to million we had a steep dropoff in claims following januarys high level and we were approaching pre covid levels of claims by the end of march this business is very wellmanaged net amount at risk remains among the lowest in the industry and our hedging remains very effective lets turn to page in total the corporate other segment had a million loss in the quarter which was a million improvement from the prior year excluding closed blocks the loss in the corporate segment was million which included a million investment gain largely offset by million of higher share based compensation expense the year ago quarter had million benefit from ameriprise share price depreciation longterm care had million of earnings in the quarter the high covidrelated mortality and terminations we saw in january declined in february and march and were approaching precovid levels by the end of march this benefit was partially offset by the covid claims level on life insurance fixed annuities had a million loss related to the low interest rate environment as i mentioned we are making good progress on our fixed annuity reinsurance transaction now lets move to the balance sheet on the last slide our balance sheet fundamentals remain extremely strong including our liquidity position of billion at the parent company substantial excess capital of billion hedge effectiveness in the quarter and a defensely positioned investment portfolio adjusted operating return on equity in the quarter remained strong at we returned million to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and buyback we just announced a increase in our quarterly dividend and we are on track with our commitment to return of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders this year with that well take your questions ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question comes from alex blostein from goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great good morning thanks for taking the question so jim walter was hoping to start maybe with some trends you guys have seen in advice wealth management and obviously another really strong quarter particularly in the wrap account flows as you pointed out over billion and thanks for the new disclosure on the billion for total i guess the first question is there just kind of around sustainability particularly in the wrap flows and maybe we can tackle it from a perspective of kind of giving us a breakdown of how much of this is coming from existing clients sort of reengaging given the fact that market backdrop is better versus new assets coming from either recruiting or same store sales james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc no alex this is jim good morning so i think were seeing good growth coming from all of the areas youve mentioned we see a good additional flow coming from current clients as were deepening through the advice relationship that weve been really having our advisors really engage with clients on and the deepening but we also see good new organic growth from client acquisition coming in as well from our advisors and as a complement from recruits that weve added over the last year as they transfer their book theyre bringing over some of the clients but i would say its a lot coming from the organic growth from our core base both for new clients that our advisors are bringing in as well as current clients where theyre deepening the relationship and bringing in more of those flows as well alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thats great to hear shifting gears maybe we can touch on the bmo acquisition i was hoping to get a little more details on that property so it sounds like the flows there are positive maybe you can talk to sort of the sources of growth and kind of what products are driving flows in that asset and i guess more importantly are you thinking about any risks from attrition as we can typically see in an asset management acquisition ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 and then from a financial perspective i guess walter that one is for you i think i heard you say accretion to operating earnings by i think you guys are paying for this with cash so i guess why is the deal not immediately accretive and i guess within the same lines maybe kind of help us with a jumping off point for revenues and pretax income pre and post synergies for that asset i know a bunch of things in there but strategic and financial highlights would be helpful james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc okay so what i can say really is that we know right now that the emea bmo area is in inflows for the last number of months through the first quarter theyre seeing it in some of their core programs and initiatives the ones that we sort of laid out to you are the strategic capabilities that we think that will really enhance and strengthen our areas to really get a more formal presence on the continent there but also that we could leverage globally we feel like as we go through this transaction since were not really what i would call meshing together both investment process or distribution capabilities in some of those areas theyre more of an addon to us that we shouldnt suffer as you mentioned a bit more of a attrition going through that process we feel very comfortable that were adding their people were adding their capabilities and what were spending more time integrating will be more of the back and middle offices adding our capabilities which are much more stateoftheart much more current in what we can provide them technologywise and supportwise and so we feel like it could be a winwin we always factor in when we do a transaction there is always some breakage you cant really determine how much it is but we always factor in that in thinking about a deal but were hoping that that would be one that will not be significant based on what were looking to do here which is very different than merging and integrating front offices and people from that standpoint we like their capabilities we think that those capabilities with our added distribution globally can actually enhance their flow picture as well but we didnt count on the revenue flows when we did the deal to make it like a makeor break we really look at this from having the cost synergies from the back and middle office plus what they think they can grow plus what we can add in and then we complement that with our distribution as a plus and so we feel like this is really good strategic is exactly what we were looking for as a complement it is one that we can easily handle through the excess cash and balance sheet that we have and it doesnt take away from the organic growth that we want our people to continue to focus on in the asset management business alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yeah so alex its walter so obviously the bmo is generating ebitda but again its a division of a large corporation so commenting on that number would be a little problematic ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 weve certainly have done our analysis of it but the big reason obviously for the accretion in is the substantial amount of onetime expense that we will be absorbing between now and that timeframe we feel very comfortable and thats why we gave you the bookends as relates to the irr on it and the certainly the elements of payback so we are working through right now and certainly well keep you abreast as we go through this and get additional information as we feel good about the fundamentals of it alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got you and as we find with a typical kind of ma transaction are these integration charges going to be backed out of your operating reported results or are you guys going to leave those in as you think about walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yeah no as we normally do alex we will back them out like most other firms do alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah makes sense all right thanks very much guys walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc youre welcome operator our next question comes from suneet kamath from citi suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks good morning i wanted to start with asset management and the very strong margin that you guys reported in the quarter the well above your to target so was there anything unusual in there that we should think about perhaps normalizing in the balance of the year and relatedly what kind of gets you back down into the range is there an expectation that maybe investment spending will increase in the back half just want to get a sense of the trajectory of the margin thanks walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc got you james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so walter why dont you handle the first part and ill handle the second ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yeah theres nothing unusual in this quarter suneet what we do and gain the benefit of deleveraging and the fact that we do not have a wind in our face as it relates to the outflows so its really from that standpoint its solid performance on the inflows and we feel the expenses will remain wellmanaged as we go forward but it is really the benefit of the inflows and the market theres nothing unusual james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc and when we look at going forward longer term i mean in the current period if markets hold we dont see that reverting back to in the at this point in time i think longer term its hard for us because theres a business mix as we said even adding the bmo transaction which is largely institutional there will be some differences there just on fee not that they dont have they have good fees but on a relative compared to our retail side so there are those various things and as you know theres always a mix change that occurs over the longer term and based on markets and a number of other factors but from a cost perspective we do not see anything that would cause a problem and from a revenue you can see that our fee basis has been holding pretty well based on new assets that were adding versus anything that are trading so its nothing in the near term its just longer term its hard to predict well have to do some further work depending on what happens over the course of the year suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc got it and then on the retail flows can you give us a sense of how much of that activity is coming from awm versus the third party channels james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc no i would say overall were getting very strong flows from our third party channel ameriprise has picked up a bit but in totality its really coming from the third party channels and so i would say we feel really good weve actually grown our share in seven of the eight top distributors in the us were getting it from a number of different disciplines the broker dealers the independents rias et cetera so we feel very good and we have a broader lineup that is actually selling pretty well this is actually a time when even fixed income kicked in for us where we were more equity now were combination of getting good equity and fixed income has picked up as well so we really feel good about the broadening there suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 got it and then just the last one for me if i could just on ma more broadly obviously the bmo transaction is what youre focused on but anything that you guys are still needing to or desiring to have from an ma perspective or do you pretty much have what you need post bmo inhouse james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah we actually feel like the bmo was one of the primary areas that we wanted to really complement which is growing a bit more and balancing out for more of the solutions oriented business a little more institutional business a little more weight for our distribution particularly in that area for emea so we feel like that was our primary focus in what we were looking to do if we did an incremental acquisition right now and we want to concentrate on getting that integrated well we feel like we got good momentum in the core of the businesses both in the us as well as what we think we could expand internationally with some of our capabilities now institutional as well with the product set we have we got some very good consultant approvals and ratings which we think will expand our platform capabilities for distribution so were feeling pretty good about that that was one of the things that we wanted to focus on in the near term and we think that this deal gives us some of that ability here suneet kamath q analyst citigroup global markets inc got it thanks jim operator our next question comes from brennan hawken from ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thank you for taking my questions and thanks actually for the total client flow disclosure the net new assets across the wealth management business certainly that helps to show the strength of the business was curious if its possible to get a longer historical time series for that data and maybe for right now how indicative is the roughly total organic growth rate that is reflected in the three quarters that you disclosed like how does that compare over time to the sort of organic growth rate implied by the total client flows over a period of a few years james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so i think ill have walter respond a little what i can say is that and weve always sort of mentioned we feel like the numbers and i think walters team is trying to reconcile going back based on the definitions being utilized which is i think the ones being utilized in the industry a little more today our client flows we think are pretty close to sort of our wrap flows there may have been a period just after the sort of the discussion on the dol et cetera where there was more of a shift from some brokerage activity to the wrap that we saw some blips in some of those initial quarters ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 but i think if you go back over the last number of quarters you probably see more of a client flow close to again the wrap flows there may be some timing issues quarter to quarter et cetera but i think thats along the lines walter but i you know more walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yeah so right now were working on that and so we will followup and get you to but what jim is saying i believe is a good representation of it so if you give us a chance well get that out as we look at the new definitions and the other things as of the data okay brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yeah great thank you for that much appreciated and then and helpful to have the high level indication thank you so for my followup another question on awm it was really good to see advisor head count pick up here this quarter so why not get a little bit more aggressive on the recruiting front or bolton ma to try to grow that head count more rapidly effectively when we look across a lot of the wealth management peers that get the best valuation in the stock tend to have solid growth in net new assets and in advisors and obviously churn is an impact and so what steps do you think you can take to continue to kind of grind down churn and then and is maybe picking up on the aggression for recruiting something that you think is compelling at this point given where the market is for advisors thanks james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so good question i think the way i would probably answer that would be that we will continue to look at bringing in good advisors to the firm and we could probably a bit more there and were reviewing it but very important for us we want to bring in the right advisors that fit the brand the culture the compliance understand what their focus on growth we dont want to just pay advisers to join us or be part of a network and process for them we want to have advisers join us that we can help grow their productivity grow their client relationships have great client satisfaction be with us a long time that really builds on the culture and the brand we think we have a great value proposition for advisers once they join us both from how we onboard them how we give them support the leadership the technology the capabilities we just dont want to roll up a bunch of firms or independents and just associate and process for them per se so thats very important to us i think we could probably maybe we could be more aggressive out there and but we also think its very important for the long term the other thing we really spend a lot of time different than other competitors about just rolling up advisors is that we focus on our advisors growing their productivity having strong client satisfaction and i think when you compare us the last time we did that analysis which we update we were more than times any independent ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 on annual productivity growth on a compounded basis for a long period of time and the same thing against the wirehouses so thats where we put a lot more of our energy but to your point we complement that with having good recruits and having good retention and well continue to look at whether we could step that up where there maybe some other firms smaller firms suited to our cultural mix but thats what weve been focused on and weve been successful with it brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for that color operator our next question comes from andrew kligerman from credit suisse andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc hey good morning wanted to go back to the advice wealth and that billion in net wrap flows just a phenomenal number and im kind of thinking back to precovid and it seems like a normalized range and a very good range would have been billion to billion and its kind of gradually jumped up and now im looking at the deposit base of billion and so my question is whats the right strike zone for wrap net flows is it billion is it billion to billion where do you think the normalized number is and given billion in deposits what can we look toward in the near term james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so andrew i think it was a very good question you or someone else or some of the people that had asked from the fourth quarter on a similar basis when we had a good pickup in flows and client activity as well what weve been seeing is and its probably a combination of factors i mean we have a reopening of the economy i think people are starting to feel a bit more comfortable i think the markets have done well so theres a little bit of that where people feel a little more comfortable in what they are doing right now and so i think thats part of it because of the positive nature of the reopening and the vaccine rolling out et cetera but i also feel part of it is a level of engagement that our advisors are also having with their clients weve really rolled out our whole foundational advice in complement to our comprehensive advice we have over million of our clients already have ph goals online that are very active with we have been rolling out our integrated technology and the way our advisors can continue to connect with clients and understand the nature of what conversations they should be having well be rolling out more tools along those lines so we feel like weve stepped up our level of having the advisors engage with the clients and giving them a lot more of the tools and capabilities to do that more seamlessly in an integrated fashion ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 and i think thats having some effect i mean its hard for me not knowing the market cycle and some of the things popping up around but i feel good that were going to continue to at least continue to gain those type of flows i cant predict whether its or whatever but i feel like were in a good spot right now and were very focused on helping that to continue andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it so good very good momentum and then thinking about the long term care block which earned million versus what one would normally expect to be breakeven and i suspect there were some covid effects that caused that uptick in earnings where do you see earnings going over the near and intermediate term in that line item and then secondly given that rates have come up a bit a lot in the last months do you think that theres a stronger possibility that you could divest of that block is there interest james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc walter with you walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc okay so andrew on the million that is the realization of unfortunately the mortality and lower basically new entrants into nursing home so the frequency so as we indicated that is starting to slow off or slow down in march it basically dropped to around million so were seeing were gauging it and certainly weve gotten the benefit of the situation with covid and were but we have our programs that are working as we indicated our benefit of programs our price increases and other things and the claims are being wellmanaged and staying within expectation so we i cant say but certainly by the trend its slowing down now as it relates to the situation with covid andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc and just interest in the block itself from acquirers walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc we again certainly the interest will interest rates certainly affect that and we certain we will evaluate any certainly bids coming in and but then we are open to evaluate elements within that but again we feel we have this the ltc under control but certainly we would look at opportunities to reinsure that andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc and maybe if i could just sneak one quick one in at the end just ga overall was up ex the effect of the stock and so forth ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 so as we look forward and hopefully the market opens up could you give any insight into what we could expect would be the overall growth in ga given that travel and entertainment might pick up do you think we could see a real sharp pickup in ga or do you have ways to just kind of keep it under control as we move forward walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc its more the latter i think that we as you noted we are managing our expenses well and even with the return to more te and other things of that nature we believe we will stay in a more controlled situation with that and as normally we get questions on awm the range on that is you saw and we think its going to be in the range so wellmanaged as we go forward andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc awesome thank you operator our next question comes from tom gallagher from evercore thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi good morning a few followups on awm yeah appreciate that new disclosure on total enterprise flows as well i guess if we split those two businesses walter how did the revenue yields and margins compare between wrap and nonwrap businesses for you because clearly your flows are being driven by wrap our presumption has been wrap has much higher margins and fee yield but just curious if you can quantify that walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc well listen we had very strong transactional activity in this quarter so obviously that drove a good profitability for us and as we look at it the margins and the profitability of these programs its they are both very good theres timing as you know in wrap you get your fee as it relates to it on the transactional youll take it upfront or spread it over backload it so the profitabilities of these are certainly with ph from awm standpoint extremely good and distinguishing between them theyre just different and they fit into the competent retirement approach that we take so theyre necessary for our clients but they all generate good acceptable returns to us thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi yeah and walter just to followup on that so from your perspective theres not meaningfully better margins if you i guess normalize and spread them out over the life of the business between wrap and nonwrap would that be a fair characterization or are they just different ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc theyre different and they both generate good returns for us they really do on the surface they are different and different characterizations to meet different needs but and timing of profitability but they both really do generate acceptable and good returns thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi okay and then just a question on the weighted average gross fee yield for the cash type deposits you break out last quarter was basis points this quarter it was basis points the rate of change is clearly slowing given what interest rates have done recently do you think were near a bottom assuming there clients continue to maintain these high balances in these accounts do you think were closer to a bottom or levelizing or do you think that we might still see a little downward pressure on the margins walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc i dont see downward pressure on the margins i do see obviously were evaluating from our standpoint the investment and opportunities that we have for that product and certainly looking now at duration versus credit but i would say it certainly has slowed as you noted but i cant say whether its bottomed ph david but its certainly slowed and were evaluating now looking at both the asset side of it and then well see what happens on the short end thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi okay thanks and then one final one just the fixed annuity transaction i think the expectation was it would garner approximately million i believe interest rates have changed meaningfully though i dont know whether that would meaningfully impact your execution price on that or not and then also just to confirm are you guys really at this point just focused on an isolated fixed annuity deal or how have you considered broadening out whether thats to andrews question long term care or variable annuities or life insurance or at this point its really just fixed annuities walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc well right now were focused on fixed annuities as jim and i have indicated we are working on that to bring that to closure and yes interest rates do affect it but we the range that youre talking about should be certainly achieved from that standpoint and as i indicated to andrew we do get constant requests for evaluation of different offers and we evaluate them but right now were focusing on the fixed annuity thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi okay thanks ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 operator our next question comes from ryan krueger from kbw ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi thanks good morning on the transactional activity in awm can you give us any sense of if its remained elevated as you have gone through april walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yes i believe it is continuing again this is preliminary information coming in but yes were seeing still continuing trends ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks and then on the fixed annuity reinsurance do you view that as providing additional capacity for buybacks above and beyond the that you target or should we think about that more as replenishing capital that youll use for the bmo transaction walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc well again we are sitting in strong capital position now as we indicate our excess capital is in billion certainly were going to generate strong capital free cash flow and going forward this yes that this transaction well replenish you can look at it that way the bmo transaction and then we make our decisions and looking opportunistically whats the best way to deploy that but at this stage were sitting in very good position and certainly the fixed annuity transaction will certainly offset the bmo substantially ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then just to confirm that the capital return target is just buybacks and dividends and excludes the ma is that right walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc thats right weve been yes our is buyback and dividends right ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you operator our next question comes from kenneth lee from rbc kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 hi good morning and thanks for taking my question wondering if you could just remind us how sensitive ameriprises earnings and specifically within the advice wealth management how sensitive the earnings could be to any potential fed funds rate increase and more specifically just wondering whether you could potentially see a benefit immediately thanks walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yeah the answer is you will see a benefit on if youre talking about awm on the fed funds and so if you look at say billion looking at just concentrating on sweep accounts its million over a year period on increase right thats the dimensions of it and then its a matter of gauging how we return that to the client but normally you have a differential between when the fed fund changes and then we evaluate the competitive situation thats trying to dimension it from that standpoint that makes sense okay kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc great great thats very helpful and just one followup if i may wondering within the asset management side wonder if you could just talk about some of the contribution that youre seeing from any solutions based mandates and wonder if youd also just share with us how this could potentially change once the bmo emea asset management acquisition is integrated thanks james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so institutionally and even from a retail weve been getting sort of mandates a little more that are solutions oriented and we also as you also know have a uk real estate property business and we have a smaller us business as well so this would complement it nicely and bring some of that advanced capability in europe to bear we know esg is very big and theyre a leader in esg as well and weve been ramping up our activities in esg in the uk for european activity and uk activity so overall we feel like itll help us hit the ground running further in europe but were also looking to further use that solution capability complementing what were already doing in the us for the us and we think that that will give us a greater ability to bring in more solutions oriented business over the longer term so i dont know if that answers your question but we had invested in solutions we do have some of the different strategies already coming to bear for some of what were doing internationally and domestically but this would advance us further kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thats very helpful thank you very much operator our final question comes from erik bass at autonomous research ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27apr2021 erik bass q analyst autonomous research hi thank you just hoping you can provide some more color on the potential opportunity from the bmo wealth management relationship in the us and how meaningful could this be in terms of incremental flows or aum james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so in the us were looking to first provide our platform capabilities to bmo wealth management but in addition well be looking to convert some of their activities over to us on the retail side for us to actually manage those activities for them and were working with bmo now weve crafted a relationship and a arrangement on that were not purchasing their us business but were working on sort of an agreement a revenuetype agreement as well as a distribution agreement to pick up a level of their activities there i dont have more detailed information right now walter i dont know if you have it walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc no not at this moment and i think we are just working from that standpoint to transfer clients over and were discussing with them just as jim has indicated and anything weve talked about before as related to the financials that does not include that aspect of it erik bass q analyst autonomous research got it so this would all be potential upside in terms of kind of revenue synergies as well as obviously you dont have the assets so theres no attrition it would all be wins that would kind of be incremental flows in the us to the extent they emerge walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yes james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah erik bass q analyst autonomous research perfect and do you have a sense of what their total aum is in the us the kind of asset management business that could be up for grabs walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc we know the amount but we just dont know whats going to transfer over so i rather not say at this time theyre working on that right now ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript
