have at the bank we have our cash sweep deposits and certificate businesses that would benefit to wrap up awm our metrics and financials are excellent pretax income was million up and margin was strong at up basis points which compares very well in the industry now ill turn to our asset management business where we delivered a strong year we stayed focus on meeting our clients needs and drove

had net inflows of billion were able to earn a significant level of flows from bmos us clients that elected to transfer their assets to us in both retail and institutional strategies this is a great example of the value we can realize from our strategic relationship with them global retail net inflows were billion including reinvestment dividends as well as strong flows from us bmo clients in terms of fixed income our results were good and in line with the industry as weve made significant ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 progress in increasing our market share in equities our flow rate declined a bit and is consistent with the industry average after outperforming in recent quarters as youve seen there has been more volatility given concerns about monetary policy and the pandemic in emea retail we had inflows on the continent in the uk market conditions remain challenging and while we experienced some net outflows flows continued to improve over the past two quarters looking ahead for global retail as we navigate this period of heightened volatility we have a strong lineup of highperforming strategies across equities fixed income and asset allocation of our us investment strategies had over billion in sales last year and thats up from four just two years ago we will continue to execute our successful strategies and reinforce

further to wrap up asset management i feel good about the business the progress weve made over recent years and our priorities to drive longterm growth moving to retirement protection solutions our results were strong with strong sales in the quarter variable annuity sales were up driven by our structured product and traditional rava product without living benefits and in protection sales were up driven by our vul product with sales nearly doubled as it is an appropriate product in this low rate environment as you know we have been taking strategic actions within the annuity business and that continued in the quarter as we further narrowed our variable annuity offerings as part of our focus on products without living benefits effective january we discontinued three of our four living benefit riders these three riders represented of our living benefit sales for the past year and by the end of the second quarter of we will have stopped all new sales of our one remaining rider which represents a very very small part of our business on the insurance side were making similar moves in the product line where we discontinued two products in our ul lineup weve built differentiated retirement protection solution businesses over many years that delivers superior financial results returns and steady free cash flow consistent with our other business lines overall ameriprise delivered a record year and were positioned exceptionally well for listen across our business were driving terrific results we ended the year with excellent organic growth a strong balance sheet and a significant excess capital position and ameriprise continued to generate one of the highest roes in financial services above and thats with our assetlight and higher returning balance sheet businesses and while maintaining a strong excess capital position so to close our team is focused on executing our successful strategy delivering for our clients and continuing to drive profitable growth now walter will review the numbers in more detail and then well take your questions walter stanley berman chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc thank you jim ameriprise delivered strong financial results across all our businesses we reached new record levels of revenue pretax adjusted operating earnings and return on equity in the quarter and for the year we ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 delivered strong flows earnings growth and margin expansion in our core wealth and asset management businesses with wealth and asset management now representing of ameriprises earnings in the quarter this compares favorably to of total earnings a year ago our retirement protection solutions businesses continue to perform well as we further optimize our riskreturn profile we continue to generate robust free cash flow across all our businesses our balance sheet fundamentals are excellent and we returned nearly of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders in the quarter and for the year consistent with our target we ended the year with a significant billion in excess capital position lets turn to slide we delivered on our profitable growth strategy in our core wealth and asset management businesses in the quarter our organic strategy was supplemented with the acquisition of bmos emea asset management business which added billion of auma in addition we were able to add a net billion of flows and aum in the quarter primarily from bmos us clients that elected to transfer additional retail and institutional assets to us overall auma was up to trillion and wealth and asset management client flows reached billion on a full year basis our flows were up nearly representing the successful execution of our growth strategies in each of these businesses lets turn to slide where you can see that we are delivering profitable organic growth revenues in wealth and asset management grew to billion with pretax operating earnings of million up this drove a blended margin of up basis points from a year ago lets turn to the individual segment performance beginning with wealth management on slide our strategy of providing bestinclass tools and technology to enable advisors to grow their practices has generated strong organic growth results in the quarter we generated record client flows of billion including billion into our wrap program organic growth combined with strong markets led to client assets of billion up our advisor force continued to deliver exceptional productivity growth with revenue per advisor reaching a new high of in the quarter up from the prior year turning to slide you can see that the results in the quarter are a continuation of our strong trends for the past two years flows increased and we continue to see excellent transactional activity levels from a differentiated client engagement total client assets grew to billion over the past two years with client flows more than doubling over the same period and over the past two years advisor productivity was up on page you can see that our focus on profitable growth is showing up an excellent financial results in wealth management in fact revenue and earnings for wealth management reached record levels adjusted operating net revenues grew over billion fueled by robust client flows an increase in transactional activities supplemented by strong markets while management pretax adjusted operating earnings increased to million ameriprise bank is a growth driver of wealth management in total the bank has billion of assets after moving an additional billion of sweep cash onto our balance sheet in expenses remained wellmanaged ga expenses increased as higher activitybased expenses and performancebased compensation were largely offset by expense discipline as we move into we will continue to manage expenses in light of the strong revenue environment and we expect proportional expense growth in the quarter our pretax adjusted operating margin was an excellent result with an increase of basis points from the prior year without a benefit from short interest rates ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 lets turn to asset management on slide where we continue to deliver excellent organic growth that was supplemented by the closing of the bmo acquisition in the quarter assets under management were up to billion including billion of assets acquired from bmo emea net flows were also strong at billion in the quarter up from billion a year ago closing this quarter included a net billion of inflows and aum related to bmo this included billion of inflows in the us from a decision by bmo us clients to transfer retail and institutional assets to us as well as billion of outflows in emea about of which was dealrelated breakage and margin in the quarter was quite strong up up from just under last year on slide you can see the strong results are a continuation of the trends over the past couple of years assets under management grew and underlying flows improved billion excluding bmo over this time period the operating leverage in the asset management is significant with margins from the trailing months of up from two years ago additionally you saw in our press release that we made some enhancements to our aum disclosure specifically we broadened our definition for alternative assets to better demonstrate our underlying business and the additional assets from bmo alternatives are an important part and growing part of our business with about billion of aum across various strategies turning to page you see that these organic growth trends are generating excellent financial performance in asset management adjusted operating revenues increased to billion the acquisition of bmos emea asset management business contributed about million to our revenues for two months excluding bmo emea underlying revenue growth remains very strong at reflecting the cumulative benefit of net inflows over the past year market appreciation and higher performance fees the fee rate in the quarter was basis points which benefit from higher performance fees partially offset by the negative impact of two months of bmo emea in our results excluding the impact from performance fees and bmo our fee rate was in line with our prior quarters at approximately basis points expenses remain well managed and in line with expectations given the revenue growth ga expenses were up excluding bmo as wellmanaged underlying expenses was elevated by performance fee compensation pretax adjusted operating earnings was million up million from last year including million of higher performance fees and a million pretax earnings contribution from bmo this demonstrates the underlying strength of our asset management business we delivered margin in the quarter which included bmo emea for two months of the quarter excluding bmo emea the margin in the quarter was if bmo had been in our results for a full quarter we expect our overall adjusted margin to decline by approximately to percentage points with the bmo transaction closed in november and a couple of months with bmo under the ameriprise umbrella the business fundamentals and financial performance are in line with our expectations this includes our expectations around accretion targets synergies and integration expenses lets turn to page retirement protection solutions include blocks of business with a differentiated risk profile that generates substantial free cash flow the business is performing well with pretax adjusted operating earnings of million up slightly from a year ago as jim said we continue to focus on optimizing our risk profile and shifting our business mix to lower risk offerings were accelerating that shift with our recent product announcements to exit va living benefits universal life with secondary guarantees and our ulltc combo product these announcements caused an uptick in living benefit sales at the end of december with a total of of variable annuity sales without living benefits for the ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 full quarter account value with living benefits represent only of the overall book now down another basis points in the past year in we would expect less than of our new sales to include living benefit riders we had a similar trend in protection where sales driven by highermargin vul sales this mix in sales and account values for both retirement and protection products are expected to continue now lets move to the balance sheet on slide our balance sheet fundamentals remain excellent we had holding company available liquidity of billion and excess capital of billion at the end of the quarter following the acquisition of bmo our diversified highquality aarated investment portfolio remains well positioned and our hedge program was effective in these strong fundamentals allow us to deliver a consistent and differentiated level of capital return to shareholders as i mentioned we returned nearly of earnings to shareholders in consistent with our target yesterday we announced an additional billion share repurchase authorization to be used through march and feel good about our ability to continue to return capital to shareholders with that well take your questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question comes from suneet kamath from jefferies suneet kamath q analyst jefferies hi thanks good morning jim i wanted to start on the us retail flow picture as we think about the past couple of years youve had a pretty good run sort of bucking industry trends in terms of inflows do you view whats happening in the fourth quarter here as a little bit of a bump in the road where you get back on track or is there anything that you need to do thats sort of more substantial james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so im assuming that youre talking about the asset management us flows suneet kamath q analyst jefferies thats correct james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc okay yeah so what we saw in the fourth quarter was that we had actually some good flows in our fixed income consistent with the industry so were like right in there with the industry average which weve been able to gain share which is one of the things we want to do and we actually see stronger opportunity there as we move ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 forward based on the funds and the performance of the funds and some of the categories that we know are in demand so i think that will be positive in equities theres been some rotation that occurred in the fourth quarter value growth et cetera a little more volatility a little sales slowed i think you saw that in the industry our total sales were about industry average when we were above the previous ph two quarters we actually feel pretty good about the fund lineup the performance of the lineup which is very strong and the number of funds that were selling now versus what we did in the past we had a little reduction in some sales as we soft closed our dividend income fund we wanted to temporarily look at that as we got a lot of activity into it to digest it but well be reviewing that as we move forward and that has been a good sales driver for us so i actually believe with the lineup and what we will do there and the continuation that equities will be in demand i feel good about that as we move forward suneet kamath q analyst jefferies okay that makes sense and then i guess one for walter on expenses i guess in the past when weve had these periods of market volatility you sort of stepped up your cost savings just wondering if thats in play at this point and then relatedly were hearing from other companies about expense pressure from inflation as well as people coming back to the office can you give us your thoughts on those impacts and your outlook for ga overall walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc sure so obviously with the markets dropping we had a correlated reduction in expenses as third party compensation so thats going to happen as it relates to developing we have strategies we have not certainly been implementing weve had this event take place in to we want to make sure we stay on track to get profitable growth and still invest in the business so were gauging this situation we feel comfortable as we navigate we have our strategy well address it its a leveraged business but ph good about that and as relates to inflation we looked at our expenses ph and certainly there is inflation as some of the wages but its totally manageable and its been incorporated into our plan suneet kamath q analyst jefferies and do you have like an overall outlook for sort of ga growth walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc ga growth we felt it was going to be again in our targeted range excluding bmo of course because thats addon from that standpoint were normally in midlow digits and so again at this stage we feel a little comfortable from that standpoint and were just evaluating where the market is going but this year and as was pointed out we anticipate we could get a benefit coming from the fed on interest rates which would mitigate some of that ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 suneet kamath q analyst jefferies yeah for sure okay thanks guys walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc youre welcome operator our next question comes from alex blostein from goldman sachs ryan bailey q analyst goldman sachs co llc hi good morning this is actually ryan bailey on behalf of alex i was wondering maybe if we can spend a second on the bmo flows for the quarter so the us clients electing to transfer assets and i think you said that was about billion are there any more assets that you think could transfer and then perhaps a second question i think you said that there was some dealrelated breakage on the emea part of the business is there anything else that youre expecting there james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so on bmo we do expect a few billion more i think will come in in the first quarter something along those lines on the breakage and we started to see a bit of breakage in the fourth quarter as we said probably of the billion out from bmo we can estimate is probably around to or so now some of that was ldi et cetera so we actually think that there will be i mean we always have to plan for a level of breakage however we saw that last year clients stayed in pretty well they really did like the assumption that we did of the business and what were doing in regard to putting it as part of our makeup so were not really in anyway disrupting some of the investment areas et cetera that are important for that but were trying to bring more capabilities to their greater technology et cetera et cetera that would also be helpful and so we will experience i mean its an institutional business so there may be up for review various things that they have to go through their processes so we have assumed the level of breakage but we will be reporting on that as we go through but thats all in the assumptions that walter mentioned as we look at the business and what it will generate ryan bailey q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it completely fair okay and maybe just one on the impact of higher rates particularly for the wealth management pretax income so some of your peers have talked about sort of basis points of sensitivity is there any color you can give us on how much pretax income we could be thinking about and then also sort of additional to that how are you thinking about moving incremental cash to the balance sheet in james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc walter you can handle it ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc sure okay so a basis point increase we will keep the majority of that as we look at it but again thats subject to doing competitor comparisons but thats been the normal trend line as it relates to that and in that range you should think about as we publish it we have basically offbalance sheet right now most affected indiscernible that has been in the mid20 range and then we also have our indiscernible which will be well get benefits from it so thats the sort of math of it that we would get ryan bailey q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it okay thank you operator our next question comes from ryan krueger from kbw ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning can you talk about the expected timing of the bmorelated expense synergies and also is million that you had originally targeted still a good assumption going forward walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc okay its walter the answer is yes the good assumption is still a good assumption about and you should assume in the range of about should occur in and the balance beyond that mostly in ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks and then i know its still early in the year but given the increased volatility weve seen in the first few weeks of the year can you give any perspective on what youve seen from retail client activity and to what extent it may have been affected by this james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so so far for the first few weeks retail activity has seemed to hold up pretty well again its always depends on what our expectations as we go forward and what the disruption may be but i think there is still the opportunity for clients to appropriately allocate in their portfolios to add funds when necessary et cetera so we havent seen a dramatic shift there i would probably say again it depends on what they might be putting money into that may have adjusted a bit but this market pullback may be an opportunity for some people it depends on whether the projection out will be more of a more disruptive volatility versus one that people feel comfortable with but so far so good ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 operator our next question comes from erik bass from autonomous research erik bass q analyst autonomous research hi thank you can you talk about the decision to stop selling the guaranteed va and sgul policies and does this materially change the amount of capital youre allocating to writing new business and also does it signal any change in your view on retaining the inforce block and should we think of the announcement as a potential precursor to a reinsurance deal similar to what you did with fixed annuities james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc okay so ill handle part of that and ill have walter handle the capital side of it so as we said we will continue to finetune our book to where we think both the products that are appropriate for clients in this environment but also appropriate for the company as far as the riskreturnrewards and the economics overall and so we have continued to shift from living guarantees back to our rava product that has no living guarantees in our structured product those were actually the rava product was the core part of the business before guarantees came into favor and we feel that they are very appropriate for a certain segment of the clientele base particularly in this environment and structures is a way for us to give people a little more of the steady state that theyre looking for in the variable side of the business so we feel very good about that and the shift away in fact you saw our sales in total actually went up last year rather than down as we started to shift and we dont feel an issue that we need to provide those guarantees and there are other providers on our shelf for those guarantees and the same thing in the insurance side of the business we have turned up the dial for our variable universal life or disability products as we get and focus a little more on the younger part of the population these are products that again were the core of our business a number of years ago and that were putting more emphasis on as we actually turn off the dial on some of the universal lifetype products in this interest rate environment so we feel very good about that theyre good products for the clients its good for the company good returns as well and ones we think are appropriate for the environment and it does help us derisk any tail risk for the future so with that ill let walter handle the capital and ill come back with the idea of how were thinking about the books going forward walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yeah thanks jim so on capital yes and obviously in this environment or base environment it will certainly reduce but the real reduction will come as youre selling less of the ph inventory in stress situation so it does certainly modulate that from a stress situation a lot more indiscernible and we did stop the sales james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so overall for the books again what we tried to convey to you last quarter and some of the information we released as well as some of the details we provided in the past we actually have very good books of business our at risk is very low compared to what youve seen in the industry for various books in the va category as an ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 example and so this just continues to add to that differentiation per se as we manage and maintain these books now in the environment were looking theres been greater levels of activity theyve been mainly as the start just like we did in our fixed annuity reinsurance mainly moving assets for the general type of account that people want in vas theyve been deeply discounted books or unique capital requirements that have been sold recently our books are very wellmanaged very low risk very capital efficient very strong cash flow generators so we are having conversations were reviewing as the market evolves and theres more of an interest strategically in the quality of book that we have in what it will generate for the future for earnings and cash flow for a provider or even from a sales perspective so we will continue to monitor the market have discussions where appropriate and it might be if theres a strategic or a value creation opportunity both economic and from a shareholder and appropriate for the buyer as well as for us and our clients were very open to entertain that but i would say that we continue to have very differentiated books very strong cash flow our at risk is very low compared to anyone out there and could easily be managed even in a volatile environment based on our excess capital position or even the call that there might be possibly on the capital which wouldnt be that significant so we feel really good about it erik bass q analyst autonomous research thank you appreciate all the details there and then if i could ask one followup from the asset management margins is this the right way to think about it kind of a low to mid40 margin for the business exbmo is kind of the baseline entering and then factoring on a kind of a to point drag from bmo initially and that that would get smaller over time as the expense synergies come through james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc i think thats a pretty good way of looking at it erik bass q analyst autonomous research thank you operator our next question comes from brennan hawken from ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my question i wanted to start with a followup on a lot of that great color that you just gave on where you are in the process of selling riversource so you spoke to the differentiated risk profile and that becoming appreciated in the market right i guess is your experience so far that the bids you received you spoke to receiving bids from both financial buyers as well as strategics on the october call so do those bids align with your view of the lower risk profile are they in line with your expectation and when you consider and have dialog with private equity or financial buyers is there interest in the idea that there could be a distribution arrangement to allow for their products to be sold into your wealth distribution channel and could that be an attractive component for that cohort thanks ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so let me start but i have walter really respond so i dont know what you mentioned in october we didnt really put the books out for bid or receive bids on them for the current things what we did was finalized and did the transaction for the fixed annuity in the summertime what we are doing is exploring that having those conversations to see whether the type of books and the type of economic returns we generate would be of interest to various players out there and we are exploring that but more importantly we look at that from all aspects as weve mentioned both strategically economically and from a client perspective i do feel like if someone really is looking for a high quality something that they can build upon something they want to be in the business for longer term there would be some good opportunity this is probably one of the best books youll ever find out there probably one of the best type of clients if you want to continue to sell to them for the type of products so i think as this market that crystallizes there will be some good opportunities and we will look at it strategically to see if two and two equals five and so thats the way were proceeding walter do you want to say anything on that walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yeah the only thing i would say as jim has indicated certainly people recognize the quality of the book and ph from that standpoint had been given and from the standpoint yes people do look at distribution deals to some of them from that standpoint so its a whole potpourri of variables that have gone into discussions right brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc got it thanks for that and then when we think about cash in the bank so that saw a nice increase and a bit of an acceleration from the prior pace this quarter then clearly what weve seen in the rate market is an increase in the hawkishness and the outlook and the forward curve so was the acceleration in transfers of deposits over to the bank due to the improving environment you have an ability to accelerate the pace ahead of the billion to billion pace per annum that youve previously indicated and where do reinvestment rates stand within the bank at this point walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc sure so we certainly have the ability and we certainly have a plan to increase the amount of transfer from off balance sheet to onbalance sheet ph is right and with the current environment and looking at this and especially with the anticipated fed increase you can get investment highquality investments the way we do it and go into so thats an opportunity but you also now have the situation because youll measure it even though we have the capacity well be getting lift coming in on the offbalance sheet but yes the answer is we have capacity good picking up of yield curve but now you also get the variable of having higher earnings coming from the offbalance sheet on the fed fund side so its going to be an interesting evaluation point but certainly it is a positive for us in all aspects ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for the color walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc welcome operator our next question comes from john barnidge from piper sandler john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you very much i had a question on advisor recruitment its really strong at up yearoveryear could you one talk about maybe average trailing revenue for new advisors versus existing and then back to your comment about better financial technology being attractive can you talk about what you have versus where theyre coming james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so from a production level the quality of our recruits are pretty consistent now with the averages that weve given you so we have a mix of those advisors but we also as part of that mix have millionplus producers teams are very large coming over but on average across the entire recruitment spectrum i would probably put it in the average of our production levels right now which is good i would also say that the survey we did of all the recruits we brought onboard come from a combination of wirehouses and independents and it was very strong theres a long detailed list of the questions asked about technology capabilities tools thought branding marketing client acquisition deepening all that stuff and very clearly it was or so in some areas 90plus percent of how well we were able to both support them give them capabilities to grow the use of the technology the technology itself et cetera so we feel really good and it was from a wide range of people joining us from very good firms as well as independent firms john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you for that my followup question in the deck it says activitybased expense likely to increase from just more people going out but you also call out expense discipline can you maybe talk a little bit about how certain prior expenses may not be returning at the same time that you do have activitybased increase thank you james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so we continued and ill let walter get to the actual expense rate but we continued even last year and the year before et cetera to invest strongly in the business and with the technology with the capabilities with better analytics et cetera with robotics with ai so weve been doing a number of things across the firm we expanded our product set and so we really feel good about what weve been doing yes we have a level of investments that we will continue to do moving forward you have to always sort of keep up and involve enhance with the digital capabilities or cybersecurity things like that but we feel very capable of managing that ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 maybe the level of investment we do this year might be a little less than what we did last year as an example that will offset some of the expense that we do see from inflation or wages but we think that well be very well able to manage that expense against the revenue growth that we have and we will modulate it if we feel like the markets have come down a bit if theres some compression that way we will look to manage the expense base in a similar fashion were doing a lot now around what will the workforce continue to evolve to be whats hybrid whats not what level of travel needs to come back versus not we know that working digitally and through video does help in various ph sessions and reduces some of the te activities in the travel but we also feel that is necessary facetoface meetings and support and group activities so some of that yes will come back in but we think well be able to modulate it okay and have a reasonable expense picture john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you very much operator our next question comes from steven chubak from wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so i wanted to start off just with a followup related to the question or a line of questioning around riversource i know you guys had talked about the quality of the book i was hoping you could speak to with the improving rate backdrop how that could impact or inform the perceived attractiveness of the asset and is there any change in demand or interest from the sponsor community just given the improved rate backdrop or how thats informing some of the conversations walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yeah so its walter yes the answer is yes certainly from the standpoint of longterm care im looking at basically our own book that would certainly increase the attractiveness at standpoint as people ph would have the opportunity to evaluate the base and then the potential of the base and certainly its a lot of peoples thinking steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got it okay and just for my followup i wanted to dig a little bit deeper into your equity market sensitivity you provided that great disclosure reflecting the impact of a market correction i know its a relatively static analysis i was hoping you could speak to some of the natural hedges in the business that could mitigate some of those pressures both in terms of increased retail engagement that you alluded to a bit earlier and more importantly the increased allocation to cash as investors look to derisk their portfolio walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yeah obviously listen these are leverage businesses if you look at asset management and ph equity box will have an increased impact this year i think because of whats causing it the fed and certainly the potential increase in interest rates that will certainly give us indiscernible and certainly on yield curve so that is the other aspect that would be beneficial within it but thats the area that we would see offsetting it and ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 then of course our ability to adjust ph other expenses as jim was saying previously done but as far as yes people shifting into sweep or into cash and the fed increases the rates that will certainly be steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc great color walter thanks so much for taking my questions walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc youre welcome thank you operator our next question comes from tom gallagher from evercore thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc good morning just a first question on the economics of the bmo us assets that almost billion that you had transferred and i guess you have a couple of billion more that you think might come in i just want to make sure i understand how the economics works here i believe you get close to basis points on the assets how much of that fee are you sharing with bmo and what is the alternative for these clients meaning like why are they moving their money to ameriprise at this point did the ownership of the us asset management business change hands or a little bit of an explanation for whats going on behind the scenes there thanks james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so what it is is really these are both retail and institutional accounts and the clients themselves have made that choice to move over to cti in the retail areas there were some mutual funds adopted the mutual fund boards made that decision as well and so clients had a choice there were other assets and activities that did not move over or that we didnt feel appropriate to move over but we feel for the ones that we had very good lineup very good investment capabilities as well as assuming some of theirs that would be great for the clients and good for us and as far as the revenue type of arrangement walter ill let you handle that walter stanley berman a chief financial officer executive vice president ameriprise financial inc yeah and so obviously from that standpoint youre right on the basis points in that approximate range and there is a revenue but its economically profitable for us and we feel more comfortable were certainly indiscernible theyve certainly signed on to be with us and i think as jim said capabilities that we provide james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah and that was mainly driven by an offset indiscernible for what they had to do in their current business activities to wind that down et cetera so we feel it was very appropriate for both parties thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc okay okay thanks and is the revenue share of or are you keeping the majority of the fee ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc i think its reasonable its certainly indiscernible i dont want to get into the terms but it is certainly i think a good arms length transaction thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc okay and then just a followup on the whole process for i guess what youre doing with the life and retirement business based on what ive heard you describe it sounds like this is a pretty comprehensive process and by that im just assuming its probably going to take the full year of for this whole thing to play out is that fair from a timing and process standpoint james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc no what i would say there is that first of all weve listened to you as analyst investors et cetera i spoke to my board were doing a thorough analysis in regard to evaluating our business what we love about the business and what we tried to explain to you as the analysts and investors that this is a very good business built over many decades very solid books of business very consistent books of business mostly all to my clients who actually take these solutions against their planning activities for their retirement et cetera and so we are very comfortable with the books were very comfortable with the risk profile were very comfortable with the economic returns i mean when you generate a roe and you have this balance sheet business and a strong excess capital you can see how those returns are quite good and dont negatively impact the business and with that the free cash flow we use to buy back stock which helps us just like to generate the free cash flow from the other assetlight businesses that go along with that so its not a where some others had to get rid of this business they needed capital they had a long tail risk that they needed to get out of to invest in their other businesses thats not our issue so what were looking at is to say this is what we have if that can add and someone can do better with it ph we invest it short if they can have other opportunities with their capital structure with their investment structure thats appropriate if in a certain sense that theyre interested in growing the business or want those capabilities or this would add a quality dimension to what theyre doing and the values there were very open to explore that and things like longterm care even we havent invested out in that book theres a lot of opportunities for someone coming in to do something like that if they wanted ph to do or the types of investments they could make so thats what were exploring yes it will take probably a while but i think the market is continuing to evolve theres a lot of money out there and theres some strategic players that might be interested so were having conversations were very open to that dialog and well explore it if something is there we will proceed if its not we feel very comfortable maintaining the books thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc thats very helpful jim just one final followup if i could i guess the perception in the market that i hear right now is that lowerquality variable annuity books have generally gotten pretty good bids like better prices than ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 most investors were expecting we have not yet tested the market with higher quality books yours would certainly fit that bill its much better quality i think on most measures than a lot of the other ones out there and so the concern is that there may not be the same level of attractiveness of bids on the higher quality books but i guess youll be the test case of that do you have any sense for whether at least even very initial price discussions youve had would appreciate the quality of your book and give you well say proper value for that or is it just too early to tell james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so youre right in your sort of look at the idea of whats been sold out there or whats been done so far and we would definitely be on the quality end of the any spectrum now having said that what i would say is i think there is an interest as people think about longterm flows and where they want to put money to work over many years and having that quality as well but its a little different its not deep in the money discount and its not just the general account theres variable accounts et cetera but i actually believe that as people start to evolve their thinking or strategic players have more of an appetite again i do believe there might be some good opportunities that could be a winwin but yeah i think those things are forming thats why were having conversations as the marketplace evolves and as people get a better understanding of how to differentiate so thats what i would say but thats a positive thats not a negative and as i said i think you looking at our returns our cash flow et cetera thats more of we will make the right decision for shareholders if that comes along tomorrow or the next day well see but i feel good about it thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc great thanks a lot operator our next question comes from andrew kligerman from credit suisse andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc hi thank you glad i made it in question around advice wealth management where wrap net flows were another record billion four quarters in a row above billion and yet just two years ago before the pandemic i think most investors wouldve been happy seeing somewhere in the billion to billion range so the question is whats kind of changed here and is this the new normal james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so andrew we would probably say we do feel like we are and have been able to generate more flows through our client base and our advisor our advisor productivity has picked up our capabilities are we feel very good and very strong even as ive mentioned in advisors that we recruit in weve been able then to really get more clients appropriately move up market actually to deepen those relationships quite well with the technology and the capabilities and the relationship management tools weve been giving them were actually adding to that as we go forward with the use of ai and capabilities of looking at further opportunities segments of their book that they can even focused on even more appropriately so we ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 feel good that we have been helping them pick up a level of that activity and that has translated to the flows that youre seeing our client acquisition was up strongly this year including in the segment that we really wanted to grow which is the ph million the million category were starting to work on moving even further up market to higher net worth were also focused on some of the younger generation as we bring in through the remote and the digital capabilities that weve been investing in were also as we develop our product solutions our integrated wrap programs and how they can move money and do it across multiple types of their portfolios for our clients and how were looking at that and were developing a new retirement solution for the longterm for them to optimize returns for the clients and longevity income so i feel really good about what weve been able to do is help advisors grow and the flow picture that that will result in of course yeah as i said last year markets always helped a little bit when theres a positive environment so thats part of the base so i cant tell you regarding volatility and other things whether that will slow down a little bit but i think the base of activity is much stronger than it was two years ago and three years ago because of what weve been doing andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it and i think that helps somewhat with my second question but i looked at your advisor count i was just checking my model and i look in advisor count is down and then is up it was flat in down in up in and then this year its up in a business jim that advisors in general appear to be in secular decline do you think you could kind of at least grow continue to grow in the low singledigits or is it going to be very tough and the answer to the prior question was great and you mentioned that that were very happy with the technology what about the other why were they not that happy james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc well it wasnt that they werent that happy what we had asked them is across all these dimensions so thats why i said there are a number of things that were above the and above all the things we asked them whether we gave them and the capabilities to support the brand et cetera help them grow better work with clients better help them get better client satisfaction all those things grow their businesses and so thats like an unbelievable so thats times out of now there might be certain things in certain firms but certain of those activities might have been good or the technology for that capability might have been good or solutions that they provided so its not like were going to be best in everything but when you get out of across a whole bunch of dimensions andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jan2022 james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc i would say we were very pleased and i think that youll find i dont know if youll find that with other firms recruiting people in so id be interested what i would tell you is as we look at the business we do feel good about our ability to continue that along those lines now as far as the number of people there are people out there that have been buying up networks and growing in advisors and it doesnt matter what their productivity level is it doesnt matter what they how they want to do business et cetera we dont really want to play that game we feel if we can bring in good quality people if we could help them grow their productivity and if i can grow the productivity across advisors and i can replenish that and grow at ill do really well and ill continue to give a very strong client value proposition my client satisfaction is out of i mean that to me makes it a branded value proposition is adding value to clients adding productivity to advisors and i got a really good branded company that i think is valued more than just an independent or someone on a process or a network and giving them technology support so thats really what were focused on andrew kligerman
