our clients amid a complex climate and were also benefiting from our excellent capabilities across the business clearly the operating environment remains dynamic equity markets have had strong yearoveryear growth as the us economy is proving resilient however inflation remains above the feds target and therefore interest rates remain high the economic picture is not as strong in the uk and

and consistent claim levels we also continue to generate good earnings and asset management even with flows being pressured the team delivered strong performance for clients and focused on fully leveraging our global capabilities to drive efficiencies total assets under management were up to billion regarding our investment performance we continue to generate good short medium and longterm performance across product lines one weaker area was in fixed income due a difficult year in but thats working through our mediumterm numbers that said we have good overall performance in fact the strength of our numbers was reflected in the most recent barrons rankings of the best fund families where columbia threadneedle ranked in the top ill also highlight that in a recent survey of top asset management firms by institutional investor columbia threadneedle ranked 6th out of asset managers for our active engagement with issuers though we remain in net outflows for the quarter in retail we did see improvement in gross sales in north america equity and fixed income flows improved in emea flows also improved and were in net inflows in continental europe given the nice pickup in equities in the uk we remain pressured in institutional we ran outflows due to redemptions and lower fee mandates and impacts from previously announced portfolio manager changes as well as slower new fundings we have a strong offering and ph are tailoring in to better serve client demand and drive flows this includes expanding our model delivery in the us advancing our real estate capabilities as well as further strengthening our bank loans clo business in asset management we continue to drive synergies and efficiency gains and you can see that in our normalized ga expenses down in terms of overall asset management profitability the north america region is performing well while emea faced a bit more pressure based on market conditions now that were through the integration in emea were very much focused on leveraging our capabilities globally gaining better efficiencies while reducing expenses for ameriprise overall the level of results we consistently achieve is driven by the totality of what we have here as well as our ability to invest for growth and manage expenses very well this includes our excellent returns and earnings growth and in terms of track records our longterm track records are excellent just looking back over the last five years i would highlight eps as an example where we have delivered compounded annual growth our return on equity of is among the highest in the industry year after year also very significant we consistently deliver a differentiated level of shareholder return returned another million in capital in the quarter and we just announced another dividend increase of ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 overall it was a great start to the year across many dimensions whats behind our

to continue to navigate for clients and invest in opportunities for growth and i feel good about our ability to build on our position this year now walter will share additional detail on the quarter and some of the numbers walter walter s berman executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc thank you jim eps grew to with growth across all segments the diversified nature of our business drives our consistent financial performance across market cycles and sets us apart from most in the financial services assets under management and administration increased to trillion benefiting from over billion of client flows over the past year and equity market appreciation this has resulted in strong revenue growth across our businesses we continue to manage expenses tightly to maintain strong margins ga expenses grew only on a normalized basis driven by our operational efficiency improvements we continue to selectively invest in areas that will drive future business growth particularly in wealth management we will maintain this discipline in and plan to keep ga expenses at levels our returns remain strong with a consolidated margin of and a bestinclass return on equity of excluding unlocking balance sheet fundamentals including excess capital and liquidity remains strong our diversified business model benefits from significant and stable free cash flow contributions across all business segments we returned million of capital to shareholders in the quarter and as you saw we announced a dividend increase a continuation of our differentiated track record in we expect to return of operating earnings to shareholders on slide you see the strong results for wealth management client and wrap assets increased and respectively from strong net flows and market appreciation over the past year client flows in the quarter were billion down from quarter one driven by higher net flows into thirdparty money market funds a year ago in the quarter adjusted operating net revenues increased to billion from growth in client assets increased transactional activity and a robust increase in net investment income in the bank which more than offset lower fees from offbalance sheet cash this drove revenue per advisor to a new high of up from a year ago total cash balances including thirdparty money market funds and brokered cds reached a new high this quarter at billion as clients remain heavily concentrated in yieldoriented products cash balances were fairly stable at billion with cash sweep down only billion in the quarter reflecting normal seasonal tax patterns ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 we expect clients will put money back to work in wrap and other products on our platform over time as markets and rates normalize which creates a significant opportunity the financial benefit from cash at the bank remains significant and will be a sustainable source of earnings going forward adjusted operating expenses in the quarter increased with distribution expenses up reflecting business growth including comerica acceleration in transactional activity growth in experienced advisor recruiting and higher payroll taxes as the business grew ga expenses increased to million reflecting higher volumerelated expenses and the inclusion of comerica we continue to invest in our growing business while maintaining expense discipline in we are targeting a ga increase in the midsingle digit range for the full year this combination of revenue growth and well managed expenses resulted in the business sustaining an operating margin of approximately turning to asset management on slide financial results were very strong in the quarter and we continued to manage the business well through a challenging environment for active asset managers total aum increased to billion primarily from higher equity market appreciation partially offset by net outflows in the quarter operating earnings increased to million as a result of equity market appreciation disciplined expense management which more than offset the cumulative impact of net outflows and the margin was in our top end of our targeted range at in the quarter adjusted operating expenses increased with general and administrative expenses flat from a year ago on a normalized basis general and administrative expenses was lower than last year reflecting the benefits from comprehensive expense management initiatives taken since we are looking globally especially in emea to enhance operational efficiencies and manage expenses so we are wellpositioned going forward lets turn to slide retirement protection solutions continued to deliver good earnings and free cash flow generation reflecting the high quality of the business that has been built over a long period of time pretax adjusted operating earnings in the quarter increased to million reflecting the benefit from strong markets and higher interest rates partially offset from strong sales growth which drove up distribution expense overall retirement protection solutions sales improved in the quarter with protection sales up to million primarily in highermargin vul variable annuity sales grew to billion with strong momentum in our structured product turning to slide ameriprise delivered excellent growth in the first quarter which is a continuation of the long track record across market cycles and our commitment to profitable growth over the last months revenue grew earnings per share increased and roe grew basis points excluding unlocking we had similar growth trends over the past five years with revenue growth eps compounded annual growth and roe improved percentage points compared to most financial services companies this differentiated performance across multiple cycles speak to the complementary nature of our business mix as well as our focus on profitable growth now lets finish with the balance sheet on slide balance sheet fundamentals and free cash flow generation remains strong and support our ability to consistently return capital to shareholders and invest for future business growth in the last year we returned billion of capital to shareholders which included million in the ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 quarter in addition we announced our annual dividend increase of taking the quarterly dividend to per share ameriprises consistent capital return strategy drives longterm shareholder value over the past five years we returned billion to shareholders with the repurchase of million shares at an average price of resulting in a net reduction of our share count of with that well take your questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions brennan hawken from ubs is online with your first question please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank good morning thanks for taking my questions you spoke to growth in experienced advisor recruiting so was hoping you could maybe provide some perspective on how you view the competitive environment for fa recruiting right now and based on that view do you think its a better time to pull back or lean into the market and why is that james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so as you saw in the first quarter we attracted highquality recruits into the business i think the recruitings a little slower in the first quarter with the markets that ran people were staying put a little more i do believe that the market is very competitive and some of the competitors are actually i think being a little more irrational in that regard so were much more focused on quality people that really think about where they need to associate they want to build good practices become more productive want the support they need to do that and those are the type of people that weve been focused on brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank yes that makes sense okay thanks and then maybe for my followup something a little more tactical cash balances have been in focus we all know that april is a big month for taxes and sometimes has an impact on your business so could you talk comment on what trends youve seen in cash balances here month todate what the impact was that we should expect from taxes and were those largely funded out of sweep or other cash vehicles walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc okay what weve seen in april is basically a small amount going out before taxes out of sweep we have started to see some actually shifting out money market thirdparty money markets again i cant say its taxes but ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 clearly the patterns there sweep is stable and weve seen a little pattern on shifting on money market thirdparty money markets brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank got it but overall monthtodate stable sweep is the right way to think about it walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc absolutely brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank great thanks for that color operator your next question comes from suneet kamath with jefferies please go ahead suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc thanks just wanted to go back to the wealth management comments about the bank net investment income rising obviously thats not a number that we can pull out of your supplements but just curious where you see that going in the balance of the year and into next year in terms of growth i know you talked about growth this year over last year and growth next year over this year but can you just put some broad numbers around what youre expecting i wouldnt guess it would be but just curious what youre seeing there walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc wont be as i mentioned suneet what youll see is that we have each year about billion each year that will be reinvested and you should figure that well pick up at listen if rates stay where they are somewhere to basis points on that so that will make a contribution because that will be almost of the total aum outstanding at the bank so its going to i see it continuing its going to slow obviously as we get into the and as we progress through the year but it will be very healthy and the profitability is quite good suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc got it and then i guess on the cost savings i mean we it seems to me like we spent more time talking about that on this call and more recent calls and i guess what i want to get a handle on is what are you trying to what are you seeing on the revenue side it would seem to me given your history you tend to talk a lot about cost savings when theres revenue pressure obviously we see it in asset management but it sounds like there might be incremental pressure in other segments i just want to get a sense of what are you responding to is it more than just pressure in the asset management business james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 no suneet i think when we look at the asset management we do believe with what we have put together the technology and the capabilities and the geographical type of makeup there is an opportunity for us to further get efficiencies in the asset management and thats very much our focus in regard to the other business and across the company from a corporate perspective we again feel like theres an opportunity for us to even tighten our operating model a bit more and get even a bit more efficiency based on a combination of the technology and all the capabilities that we put in place and how were operating including geographically so were looking at that its not because of any external pressure per se its something that you know that weve done over cycles as we reengineer and continue to invest but at the same time we are making good new investments in ai and data and analytics and technology platforms and cybersecurity and so what were trying to do is we know that we want to invest and we know that if we can get some other efficiencies on the expense base thats always helpful for us and again we cant dictate what the market conditions are but it gives us flexibility suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc got it and then just one comment i had just on the experienced advisor recruits i think for many quarters youve given us the number of recruits which is helpful but i think theres also been a change in like the size of the practices that youve been bringing onboard so maybe at some point if you can give us a look at over this period of time this is how much assets came in from those recruits i think that would be helpful james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc will do so thank you operator your next question comes from wilma burdis with raymond james please go ahead wilma burdis q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning is there any pressure from clients to passthrough more shortterm interest rate benefits especially as the rates could stay higher for longer james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc well as you saw i mean we have a lot of cash balances and a lot are invested in whether it be money market brokered cds our own certificate programs et cetera even in our bank now we have higher savings products et cetera so no because whats left in sweep is more of that transactional liquiditytype thing just like you maintain in your bank account sort of but in this case its where activity within the overall business that they have and maintain and that cash moves so if everything was sitting in sweep then the answer would probably be yes but thats not the case wilma burdis q analyst raymond james associates inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 okay thank you and then can you talk a little bit about how you guys think about acquisitions in awm space especially maybe for scale a little bit something a little bit larger just kind of curious what youre seeing there thanks james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc is that regarding asset awm wilma burdis q analyst raymond james associates inc yes james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc okay wilma burdis q analyst raymond james associates inc awm james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc well what we look as we said is we look to associate people that really feel that we can add value to their practices and what we can bring we look at other things that may make sense for us but again were not just looking to roll up firms and put it on a network we really look for people to join us and build out under what we provide from a client experience perspective so thats the way we go about thinking about it wilma burdis q analyst raymond james associates inc thank you operator your next question comes from tom gallagher with evercore isi please go ahead thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi morning first question is can you provide some color on what kind of margin youre getting on new flows the billion of net inflows overall to awm when i look at jim i agree with your comment that margin is certainly impressive but just curious as you think about organic growth what thats going to do to margins assuming we keep the macro constant on kind of your inforce earnings thanks james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so tom as you look like even in the first quarter what we saw was a nice increase in core business activities and what you had a little more is the on the cash side that came off a little bit in the total contribution to the margin and so when you look at the totality of that underlying business particularly as you kind of combination ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 of business thats there transactional wrap fee business and what theyre sitting on the cash sidelines coming back in which would give us higher margins if its not in the cash certificates brokered other things like that so i would probably say theres a good opportunity there based on people cycling back into the markets we saw a nice start to increase in fixed income again rather than just shortterm cash so i think theres some of that that will occur part of thats from the new flow as you said but part of its really from the core of what came in and whats sitting there and so i would probably say in the past year or two a bit more of that has been in the cash side and when that cash goes into money market or into brokered cds et cetera that doesnt give us as much margin and that should come back in thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi and jim sorry just a followup there would you so would you say or maybe this is for walter would you say the incremental margin youre getting on new flows is above or below the level if you would just isolate it that way james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc i didnt look at exactly how much of the new flow came and went right into the market yet i would probably say its relatively consistent because our advisors dont put it all to work immediately when it comes in so i would probably look at it that way that its probably relatively the same at this point thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi got you thats helpful and then just one followup long term care risk transfer walter i think you mentioned last quarter that you were sort of encouraged by bidask spread narrowing can you talk about where your head is at with that is that something youre actively pursuing would you have to bundle other risks to potentially transact on that walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so tom as i said last quarter we certainly looked at the ph manulife transaction and we are evaluating it we really are we continue to do that and evaluate these tradeoffs and certainly its it moved the bar and were just evaluating that thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi okay thanks operator your next question comes from ryan krueger with kbw please go ahead ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi thanks good morning my first question was on the can you give us some sense of your expectations for bank not nii but just bank asset growth in whether it be moving more from cash sweep or growing it organically ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yes so were looking at that now and obviously we do have buffers in the sweep accounts so it would be we havent decided on the amount yet we ph will thus evaluate but it will increase its certainly not at the levels weve increased previously but certainly theres potential to increase it and then of course were going to be picking up basically interest earnings on basically when we reposition the billion each year so i would say that it will be increasing but and then also well be launching other products there too so its a combo and we certainly have room to do that ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks and then i guess back to toms question just curious to what extent are you i guess are you interested specifically in risk transfer with riversource or i guess would you consider something thats more broad a more broad strategic move with riversource rather than isolating to a risk transfer deal james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so we do evaluate different possibilities but as i said i think our business is performing really well i mean even in long term care i mentioned about were earning million but even if you look over the last four quarters we had some nice positive income and we think thats pretty stable now and so if an opportunity came along that made sense for us with a good strategic type of partner on a reinsurance type we will be very open to explore that but on the other side i think we have a really good hand and it gives us a lot of free cash flow and again the good solutions and we have a real a large complement of solutions on our shelves so its not like we have to be the provider of when were not so we pick our spots but we feel good about it but again were we will always look at if theres a better opportunity for us ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you operator your next question comes from alex blostein with goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey jim walter good morning just one for me you guys talked about expense management and in your earlier comment you suggested that theres a little bit maybe of a broader effort thats holding across the organization to focus on efficiencies and its great to see ga being held flat versus so but i guess looking beyond how do you think these efficiencies ph will affect ga growth sort of like on a multiyear basis should we think of that being below the trend of what we see from the kind of the prior several years or sort of as a oneoff benefit thanks walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 so on the expense side alex certainly we will garner a reasonable amount in but therell be carryover and certainly of the initiatives that we take in and then of course the ones that will continue so you should expect that this is part of weve always done reengineering but this i would say has an improved trajectory as we look at it and the opportunities to process reengineer alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great all right thank you operator your next question comes from craig siegenthaler with bank of america please go ahead craig siegenthaler q analyst bank of america good morning jim walter first one is on recruiting so i know you dont disclose this before the q but advisor loans grew last year and im wondering how you expect them to grow this year in and also given your comments to an earlier question on recruiting how have your transition assistance rates changed roughly over the last three years just given intensifying competition on the advisor recruiting front walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc okay so on advisor loans we yes we have increased and certainly we are competitive so you should expect that that would increase as we are on transcom proposals and as we start tracking more and more advisors but that would stay within our limits but you should see those loans increasing for sure and we certainly have the cash capacity to do that craig siegenthaler q analyst bank of america thanks and i have a followup on wealth manager operating efficiency so if you look at the ratio of distribution expenses relative to management fees and distribution expenses sorry distribution revenues its sort of a payout ratio but that ratio hit an alltime high this quarter and at the same time ga growth remained elevated at which was in line with last year but its above your midsingle digit target for the year im just wondering what drove up expenses in the first quarter and how should we think about the forward trajectory within the wealth manager sic wealth management segment walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc on distribution it was payroll taxes and of course you have a high distribution when you have higher transactional elements from that standpoint and as far as the as we indicated the first quarter usually does ph blip up but we are staying within what weve indicated in the middlesingle digits as a growth area for us and so we will be investing but thats the target range craig siegenthaler q analyst bank of america great thank you guys operator your next question comes from michael cyprys with morgan stanley please go ahead ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning thanks for taking the question wanted to circle back to your commentary on the large amounts of customer cash on the sidelines i think over billion overall about billion or so in money fund balances and brokered cds i was hoping you could speak to some of the steps that youre taking to help facilitate the movement of this cash into wrap accounts in terms of what can you do to make it as frictionless as possible and what rate backdrop do we need to see for this cash to move more meaningfully into wrap accounts and if you look out over the next couple of years what would success be in your view in terms of capturing what portion of this cash james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc well i mean listen its hard to say because it does depend a little bit on market conditions and what i seen mean by market conditions like the equity markets been up strong but if you look at how fast it ran and then you looked at where rates dropped so quickly initially on the long end of the curve and now that its starting to come back up again and they are up nice again back to a more reasonable level i do believe that there is an opportunity as people start to think about rotating back into fixed income for the longer term as well as if the equity markets do pull back as they have over the last month so to speak and become a little more what i would call less reliant on just a few of the hightech stocks et cetera you will see a rotation back in because that amount of money is abnormal to sit on the sidelines but again at a rate in the short term it makes sense and its not like our clients or our advisors are active traders back in and out of the market so i do believe that as they are able to read what that market is over time and they feel more that its not like theyre getting caught on the high end that money will start to rotate now how much goes back in its anyones guess but were no different than what you see out there across the industry today we saw some flows as an example even our asset management on growth side start to pick up a little and same thing in fixed income but some in equities so i think some of that money will go back but it was a high point as we hit last year because of the cycle michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc great and just a followup question i was hoping you could maybe update us on your lending solutions including pledged assets line that you have for advisors and for their clients just curious how built out this lending offering is compared to where youd like that to be maybe you could speak to some of the steps and initiatives that you might be looking to take over the next year or two in order to drive greater uptake amongst the advisors and clients from the lending solutions walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc looking at the bank cds and certainly and were well be looking at to launching our base checking capabilities and supplying also new mortgage capabilities certainly helocs and things of that nature so theres a full program that is indiscernible as you know we have a fairly extensive pledge and that we will certainly be looking to penetrate that more and that is certainly totally aligned on building the relationship with our clients and deepening that relationship ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah we just came up with a segment of that for fixed pledge as well and so that is also going to help grow so yeah were probably still underpenetrated on the pledge side of it compared to some others that we think will be an opportunity for us michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator your next question comes from jeff schmitt with william blair please go ahead jeff schmitt q analyst william blair co llc hi good morning so youve been signing some partnerships in the financial institution channel recently is there potential for that pace to pick up or maybe for you to sign larger partnerships just given some of your competitors may be running out of capacity right now walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yes we certainly with comerica we that has turned out to be a very good relationship and yes we have a pipeline that we are certainly evaluating and we feel we do have the value proposition to basically satisfy the clients and really provide them with the capabilities that we provide for basically planning a number of aspects from that standpoint james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc and we are signing some small deals we dont put them out there as much to publicize them but we are bringing in some other deals and our pipeline is good so again the larger ones we wanted to really do comerica really well et cetera and so we learned a lot from it and set up our capabilities so we think theres an opportunity as well in that category jeff schmitt q analyst william blair co llc okay great and then on client cash levels how much is sitting with comerica right now and i guess do they so they all have to transition to ameriprise sweep options in the second half is that right so some of that cash could kind of either leave or go into the market or what have you walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc it is about billion and they certainly is they are as part of the program theyre transitioning and well see we just dont have the full information now about what thats going to be its probably have a better idea at the end of the second quarter ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 jeff schmitt q analyst william blair co llc okay great thank you operator your next question comes from john barnidge with piper sandler please go ahead john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co good morning thank you for the opportunity can you maybe talk about the slowdown in institutional asset management mandates that was cited is the conversion rate being elongated along with your discussions and what are you hearing as the most common pushback thank you james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes i mean some of it was a bit elongated that you would expect the fundings or even the cycle but there is a growing interest back again both in the fixed income area as well as in the equities so we actually think that this will pick up as we go further into the year and the mandates that we sort of lost in the first quarter were sort of some lower fee a pension things like that that we theyre a little lumpy in that regard but we feel that we can win some more as we go forward that the appetites there out there in the industry not just in the us but internationally so were very much focused on that john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you and then my followup question i think there was a bit of severance in the quarter is that expected to impact flows prospectively at all james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc we had some of the remnants of the changes we made that came out in the first quarter that was in the flow picture but no we dont expect more from that john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you operator your final question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning this is michael anagnostakis on for steven i guess just a couple here on capital bmo largely integrated at this point how are you thinking about prioritizing excess capital deployment and is strategic ma something youre looking at more closely if so where might you look to buy rather than build thanks james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 23apr2024 so we actually we continue to buy back nicely i mean in the first quarter it was a little less than we normally had done but that will pick up as we go through the year and i think walter had mentioned that were targeting initially around the mark and then as we said we just raised the dividend again that will take some more of the cash but we still have a healthy balance sheet were not out there looking to acquire per se theres always if theres an opportunity or the market falls out or something that gives us value well look at it but were very much focused on continuing to invest organically and really focus on getting the operating efficiencies particularly in the asset management business now and we feel good about that including what we do from an overall investment cycle for our technology and capabilities and products i mean were working on a number of different new product areas for us in asset management like active etfs et cetera so we feel good were looking to build out a little further on our international property areas et cetera our clo business so there are things that were investing in a bit more organically as well but again we dont rule out acquisitions but were not necessarily looking to target things at this point michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc okay great thats super helpful and just on the buyback so payout is still the expectation it sounds like you guys are more focused on the organic internal investments but given the banks largely built out maybe ma is less of a focus here and youre generating strong cash flow why not ramp the payout ratio back to the ph to zone that you historically ran at thanks walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well we certainly have the capacity to do that and we evaluate it on an opportunistic and we situation as we look at it but yes we do have the capacity at this stage we feel the is a good return level and there is there are other areas that we certainly as i said we will be growing the bank so it would require additional but i would say at this stage we have the capability we just feel its opportunistic we look at it and then we evaluate it and youve seen in prior times we have gone up but at this stage we feel the is an appropriate level michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc got it thank you operator we have no further questions at this time this concludes todays conference thank you for participating you may now disconnect ameriprise
