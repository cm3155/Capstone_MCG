adjusted operating results and with that ill turn it over to jim james michael cracchiolo chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings call ameriprise performed well in a significantly more challenging environment and delivered a solid quarter clearly high inflation in the us and globally as well as geopolitical uncertainty continued to cause greater volatility and pressured markets with the fed raising rates and concern about a potential recession markets are experiencing headwinds and thats weighing on investor sentiment while the environment impacted our results particularly in asset management we delivered strong profitability good client flows in wealth management and strong results at the bank were continuing to serve clients well managing our expenses prudently and investing in the business to drive near and longerterm growth lets move to secondquarter results compared to a year ago total assets under management and administration declined to trillion we benefited from the bmo emea acquisition and the cumulative impact of ameriprise client net inflows but assets were affected by a negative foreign exchange and the steep decline in both equity and fixed income markets in terms of adjusted operating financials revenues grew to billion as good business performance offset market impacts with that earnings were up with eps up to and roe was very strong at compared to a year ago ill turn to advice wealth management where we delivered another strong quarter we had good activity in a tough market environment were serving clients well with our goalbased advice driving strong engagement and earning strong satisfaction total client net inflows were billion down but quite good in this environment our wrap net inflows also declined to billion cash balances were up sharply to more than billion compared to more than billion a year ago even in a more challenging operating environment our advisor productivity was strong up to per advisor we recently hosted our national conference for our top advisors and the level of engagement was terrific theyre excited about growing their practices at ameriprise and appreciate the investments weve made and the support we provide were also seeing nice engagement with advisor recruits we had another good quarter in terms of recruiting adding highly productive advisors our value proposition stands even taller in choppier markets when experienced advisors join us they routinely say our culture technology financial planning capabilities and ability to grow are key reasons they make the move were driving meaningful momentum and i feel good about our pipeline ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 now ill give you some perspective on our growing cash business which represents a significant future revenue and earnings opportunity for us first were beginning to generate more revenue from our offbalance sheet cash as the fed increases short rates second we continue to move more assets to ameriprise bank garnering additional spread including moving billion to the bank late in the second quarter for perspective total bank assets are now at billion assets have more than doubled since the beginning of and were positioned to take this further an important takeaway for you is that as we move through the second half of and into the growth of our cash business and rising interest rates will provide an offset to equity market weakness that leads me to awms financials we continue to generate strong pretax income up to nearly million and our margin continues to accrete up basis points nearly even after the impact of substantial market declines moving to retirement protection solutions the business is performing well in this environment and reflects our strategy to focus on our core products ill start with variable annuities overall sales were down given our move away from living benefit guarantees we continue to prioritize annuities without living benefits in our structured products in protection life sales declined given the climate and our move away from fixed insurance we remain focused on our vul and di products which have good profitability and are appropriate for our clients in terms of earnings they were in line with our expectations and our financial results and free cash flow were good and our risk profile remains well managed now lets turn to asset management weve already referenced the challenging operating environment that has resulted in asset declines and tough retail flows for the industry were experiencing that pressure too however we feel like the business is performing well and were making appropriate adjustments as we move forward assets under management was up a bit yearoveryear as a result of the bmo acquisition and the cumulative impact of net inflows offset by market declines and a significant foreign exchange impact in the quarter revenue was essentially flat overall lets start with investment performance our longterm numbers continue to show good consistency for our and 10year time periods with over of our funds above median on an assetweighted basis regarding one year performance its been a tough period in both equities and fixed income domestic equity results were good driven by our largest funds moving back above the median in international equities our quality position has been more of a challenge in these markets in fixed income results have been solid in europe but in the us were impacted by our longer duration positioning and quality focus in credit we do feel with market conditions beginning to stabilize we should see some improvement lets turn to flows where we had outflows of billion in the quarter that included billion of legacy insurance partner outflows this reflects the pressure youve seen in retail but was partially offset by positive institutional results in retail overall we had lower gross sales and higher redemptions resulting in billion of net outflows this was driven largely by weak conditions in the united states and to a lesser extent in emea in us retail equity outflows were generally in line with the industry and in fixed income results were behind given our product mix compared to the industry we did not participate nearly as much in short duration as interest rates stabilize and investors see opportunities we believe our product positioning should garner improved flows in emea retail flows also remained under pressure however we did see some improvement in continental europe ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 turning to global institutional excluding legacy insurance partners net inflows were billion we had some good inflows in fixed income and other strategies in addition to our broad lineup of traditional institutional strategies were bringing more focus to multiasset and solutions as well as alternatives i was with the team in london in june and theyre feeling good about the core business the integration and the extensive capabilities we offer clients in fact just a few weeks ago we announced a rebranding of bmo strategies to columbia threadneedle which was an important step as we move forward ill close asset management with the financials our margin was and that incorporated the bmo business which has lower margins based on their mix given market decline and impact on revenue were taking steps to continue to control discretionary expenses thoughtfully well be paying close attention to market environment as we move forward so overall ameriprise remains in a strong position we have a proven track record of navigating tougher times and well continue to do so were highly engaged with our clients in helping them stay on track and from a financial perspective rising interest rates will act as an offset to compressed markets as we move through the balance of the year we will be focused on managing our discretionary expenses even more tightly as we move forward importantly our balance sheet fundamentals remain very good we continue to generate strong returns of substantial free cash flow which provide flexibility in the quarter we returned million to shareholders and are on track to return of operating earnings to shareholders in with that ill turn it over to walt who will provide his perspective and more detail on the quarter and then well take your questions walter stanley berman executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc thank you as jim said results in the quarter were strong with earnings up to million and eps up to in face of substantial market declines this demonstrates the underlying strength of our business model and highlights the diversification benefit each segment provides across market cycles as well as initial interest rate benefits and overall expense discipline throughout the firm as we move into the second half of the year benefits from rising rates and higher cash balances are expected to offset the realized pressures from the market volatility our highquality diversified investment portfolio and hedge program continue to support strong balance sheet fundamentals and our business is generating good free cash flow despite the elevated level of market volatility in the quarter ameriprise returned million of capital to shareholders and maintain significant excess capital billion we are on track to return approximately of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders this year lets turn to slide we ended the quarter with assets under management and administration to trillion down reflecting equity and bond market depreciation as well as foreign exchange we are executing our growth strategies including the integration of the bmo business the bmo business contributed to our geographic diversification with international assets now representing of asset management aum up from prior to the bmo acquisition and we continued to benefit from strong ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 underlying organic growth momentum with billion of wealth in asset management flows over the last months total flows in the quarter were billion with billion of inflows in wealth management offset by billion of outflows in asset management lets turn to individual segment performance beginning with wealth management on slide wealth management client assets declined to billion despite the exceptional market depreciation in the quarter with equities down and bonds down we generated strong client flows from new client acquisition excellent experienced advisor recruiting and deeper client relationships our advisors had strong productivity growth with revenue per advisor reaching in the quarter up from the prior year on slide you can see wealth management profitability benefited from organic growth and the initial rise in interest rates adjusted net operating revenues increased or million to billion as market depreciation and lower transactional activity during the quarter was more than offset by rising interest rates and client flows cash balances increased to billion up from last year at the same time the gross fee yield doubled versus last year driving higher interest earnings in the quarter expenses remain well managed ga expenses increased million or primarily from higher volumebased expenses over the past year overall wealth management profitability remained strong with pretax adjusted operating earnings of million up from last year and our pretax operating margin reached up basis points as you can see on slide we are well positioned to realize significant incremental benefits from rising rates on our cash products this year and going forward in the quarter we transferred billion of brokerdealer sweep balances onto the banks balance sheet in two and threeyear duration strategies with yields above on average in july yields on new money purchases at the bank increased further and are in the range we continue to feel good about the credit quality of the portfolio with most of the portfolio in the aaarated structured assets we plan to bring an additional billion of assets onto the balance sheet during the third quarter bringing the full year increase to billion our model leverages both brokerdealer sweep program and the bank to optimize earnings from cash products currently we have about onethird of the client cash balances at the bank and we expect it to be nearly by the end of the year in addition our certificate business is another area that benefits from rising interest rates in total we expect to generate substantially more interestrelated revenue in relative to which would offset current marketrelated impacts based upon our current assumptions the interest rate benefit will increase further in lets turn to asset management on slide where performance was in line with the macro environment total assets under management increased to billion as the acquisition of bmo business was largely offset by market depreciation and foreign exchange translation asset management flows were negative in the quarter with continued strength in our global institutional business offsetting a meaningful portion of retail outflows like the industry we continue to experience pressures from global market volatility a riskoff investor sentiment and geopolitical strain in emea margin in the quarter declined to it should be noted that bmo reduces our margins by approximately basis points going forward our new margin target will be in the to range reflecting the addition of bmo which is primarily an institutional business ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 on slide you can see asset management financial results were a reflection of the challenging market backdrop adjusted operating revenues were essentially flat at million as the addition of bmo offset the impact of doubledigit market depreciation foreign exchange rates and outflows likewise earnings in the quarter declined million importantly we are managing the areas we can control the underlying fee rate remained stable in the quarter at basis points expenses remain well managed with ga expenses down excluding bmo we are currently in the process of evaluating all discretionary spend and hiring we remain committed to managing expenses very tightly in the current revenue environment lets turn to slide retirement protection solutions continued to deliver stable earnings and free cash flow generation as a result of its differentiated risk profile pretax adjusted operating earnings were million sales in the quarter declined as a result of market dislocation and management actions to reduce the risk profile of the business most notably variable annuity sales declined reflecting the uncertain market environment as well as our decision to exit manufacturing products with living benefit riders which was completed in june account value with living benefit riders represent less than of the overall book down nearly percentage points from last year our risk profile remained strong with va hedge effectiveness in the quarter and an estimated rbc ratio of now lets move to the balance sheet on slide our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong and our diversified highquality aarated investment portfolio remains well positioned these strong fundamentals allow us to deliver a consistent and differentiated level of capital return to shareholders even during periods of market volatility that we experienced this quarter during the quarter we returned million to shareholders and excess capital is at billion we remain on track to return approximately of the adjusted operated earnings to shareholders in with that well take your questions ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin our questionandanswer session operator instructions we have our first question from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thank you for taking my questions love to start with the bank and the yield provided some great color on plans to continue to shift balances saw really attractive balances but i believe walter that you indicated that assets moved to the bank in the second quarter late in the quarter so considering that and considering where reinvestments are how should we be calibrating for the potential yield upside not only from averaging in the late shift in the quarter but then further deployments of the billion that youre considering in the third quarter thanks walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc okay so if i understand your question we ph werent really shifting in the billion we believe it will be in the early part of the quarter that we will do that obviously well continue to invest in our structured aaa investments in which currently are yielding in the range and so that will make a total of about billion of new funds into the bank and deployed and like i said in the second quarter is and now at current rates is brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay great thank you and then when were thinking about nii continuing to grow saw really strong margin trends here this quarter pretax margin trends in awm despite the challenging environment so nii clearly helpful there as that continues to grow you continue to deploy more cash should we be continuing to pace margin expansion at a similar level that we saw here in the second quarter even if markets remain challenging walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc again a lot of assumptions in there but from the standpoint of looking at the opportunity we have on the cash side and certainly the strong flows that we are garnering in this environment you should be able to see margin maintain and expand brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for the color operator thank you our next question is from andrew kligerman with credit suisse andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 hey good morning recruiting was very solid i think youve got now plus advisors it was up about a percent sequentially hows the pipeline there is this a business that you think is going to continue to grow throughout the year despite this market turmoil james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc andrew yes thank you for the question we continue to see good recruits i mean actually second quarter was actually stronger than the first and the pipeline continues to look good we are speaking to more people i think people are recognizing what we bring to the plate in combination of the support we give the technology and how we help them really grow their practices were getting really strong reviews from people who have joined us and so we feel that this is a continued good opportunity for us and even as you go through these volatile markets based on the type of support we give and helping advisors to actually achieve more in regard to their productivity and how they manage their businesses we feel its a good opportunity for us andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thats great and then just on the wrap flows if youd asked me three years ago when you were doing billion to billion in net flows and you said you did billion like this quarter i would have thought that was an outstanding result and probably it still is but recently you had peak numbers around billion and my question is is this billion a good base now or do you think that could continue to be pressured even lower just given the market volatility james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc well i think what youre asking its also an excellent question and so yes our total client activity has increased over the years as youve seen and even in this last quarter we brought in almost billion of new client inflows now with this market as you would imagine the deployment of whether its new money or even current money is a little more people are a little more putting on the sidelines and waiting until things are stable so moneys still being deployed but not to the extent where you have rising markets or the stability in the markets so with the pullback we experienced i mean first part of the year youre down bond markets were also down so i think the billion is quite strong in this type of market environment my feeling is money will continue to go back into the market as things stabilize particularly even in the fixed side of the business so i dont see anything changing now whether you got some material market dislocation occurring in third and fourth quarter i cant tell you but i think if markets arent materially different we should still continue to see good flows andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thats great thanks a lot operator thank you our next question is from alex blostein with goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everybody thank you for the question so maybe just to start with some of the cash balances dynamic within advice wealth walt i was wondering if you can give us an update how the cash ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 balance is holding up so far in the third quarter given obviously pretty strong trends in  with cash balances being up and as we think about the deposit betas it looks like you guys passed through almost nothing to the customer in the second quarter so any updated thoughts around sustainability of sort of such low deposit betas as you progress through the rest of the year would be helpful walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc sure alex they are holding up from that standpoint so the trend youve seen it is holding as it relates to the crediting rate for clients we go through an extensive competitive review and on that basis we did increase some of the rates as it relates to based on that review and we will certainly consider continuing to evaluate that which we do weekly also we see that obviously we will start crediting if the fed basically increases on the basis points that we anticipate at the end of the month and so right now we feel there is certainly opportunity as rates increase and to certainly credit and those are in our assumption base alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it i guess as you think about just the tradeoff of growing the bank beyond you gave obviously very clear guidance of how large you expect the bank to get by the end of but seeing how the yield on broker sweep balances will be fairly attractive given again its all floating how are you kind of thinking about balancing growth of the bank versus just leaving it in thirdparty bank sweep given that spread probably narrows a bit here walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah listen its a good question but if you go back to the first quarter of certainly we were earning certainly a good shortterm return and then disappeared so the bank gives us the ability to really have a steady earnings strength with highquality investments so we are balancing that and the spread were getting right now we feel is very good with the risk profile so we will continue to do that from that standpoint we feel its a critical part of our overall cash strategy so were very fortunate to have the bank not only to offer to our clients new products and capability but also given the ability to have the stabilization of having the spread income come through alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great just a quick one for me at the end here as we think about ga thats held up really nicely in the quarter particularly weve seen you guys bring down expenses in ga in the asset management business but when you think about the firmwide ga run rate for the back half of the year given obviously fee challenges on the back of lower markets how are you thinking about the ga run rate for the back half i heard your comments qualitatively about pausing maybe some of the initiatives and looking for ways to save but i guess relative to like the 880ish million ga run rate we saw in the second quarter what does the back half look like walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc number one from a company standpoint certainly we look at we are going to be very well managed on our ga overall as you indicated certainly asset management jim indicated certainly theyre looking at discretionary spend so overall from a company standpoint we are going to be in the range that we talk about and were performing well as it relates to awm with the good revenue growth we see and everything its going to be managed but we are certainly trying to garner and increase basically and take advantage of this situation to ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 invest so its going to be well managed and certainly within expectations to the revenue growth that we see which we think is going to be good alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc okay thanks very much operator and we have our next question from thomas gallagher with evercore isi thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc good morning walter just wanted to come back to what if you can give some indication of broadly what youre investing the banking deposits in i think you mentioned aaastructured assets are those clos or what can you give a little more color on why you feel confident in the quality on the asset side walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc okay it is structured its in cmbs it is basically in retail mbs and the clos are the highest structure within the structure and they all are triple rated from that standpoint of what we invest is in aaastructured securities thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc okay thats helpful question on your capital i think excess capital went down by million this quarter can you talk a bit about what drove it i assume it was variable annuity related in your life insurance business maybe a little bit below the surface sort of what happened there with hedging was it higher required capital and what kind of drove that walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well its you saw it dropped million again within our indiscernible expectations there was that tolerance reporting it was within total tolerances it hit reserves and basically capital on the va side as it relates to the drop in the quarter and so from that standpoint the hedging was effective is at so we feel very comfortable with it but it was a substantial drop and certainly within our expectations from our modeling so it was both on both reserves and on capital thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc okay thanks and then final question just can you give an update on how the whole process for potential risk transfer is going whether i think when you started this whole process late in you had commented that you felt like the quality of your insurance business would be validated as you went through that process would you say you still feel that way that if you do do something its going be reflected in an attractive price or what have you learned so far through that process maybe walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 so as again were continuing to evaluate we certainly have interest in that and were evaluating that and yes to be direct about it i think that it is clear to us that the value and the quality which we have is being recognized from that standpoint but as you know these are long tail valuations and theyre continuing thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc okay thank you operator thank you our next question is from suneet kamath suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning just a couple for me walter i think last quarter you talked about a million benefit from the bank and i know we talked about a bunch of moving pieces so far on this call but can you give us a sense at least based on where we sit today kind of how youre feeling about that million number did it contemplate future rate hikes and that sort of thing just some color there would be helpful walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc sure so in there were anticipating based on latest estimates from the fed therell be an additional basis point increase and well see where that goes certainly we also the crediting rates we are assuming that we would start distributing at a higher level within that so right now the number versus for the whole year is the change versus last year would be in the million range plus so that million that we talked about is in the million range plus for the total year suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc and thats for so as we think about walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc higher than yes suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc yeah okay all right thats good and then i guess sort of a specific one but i noticed that your longterm care reserves came down i think about from last year is that just the benefit of higher rates can you talk about that a little bit and then to follow up on toms risk transfer question any more activity in terms of longterm care that youre hearing in the market walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc okay on the reserves i believe it is but well get back and confirm that as it relates to were evaluating let me just say we continue to evaluate across the spectrum all right ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc okay and then just last one is just on the asset management margin the new target of to is that entirely bmodriven or is there also a piece related to the pretty significant market decline that weve seen here in the second quarter and then at some point do you start to push back towards your prior range or is it just kind of the new level for that business thanks walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc the basis points is strictly bmo thats a normalization on the bmo so the to is like i said going down the basis points strictly because in bmo it does not and then obviously were coming down because of the market standpoint but of course we were in the 40s and now its dropping because of the deleveraging thats taking place because of the equity markets and the fixed income and well continue thats it hopefully i answered it suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc yeah i got it sounds like thats the new level with the business okay thanks operator our next question is from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so just one followup for me relating to that prior question on the asset management margin outlook i just wanted to make sure walter it does sound like that is the new run rate but does that to contemplate some of the actions you alluded to around discretionary spend and also wanted to see whether that also incorporated some of the bmo expense synergies that are not yet reflected in the run rate walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so from that standpoint it is now normalized okay because we always said it would be to and it is our target range so as we look at the markets and we evaluate the implications we are going to be looking at the expenses and it does have some of the synergies that we anticipated with bmo which was going to be more back loaded to steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc understood and maybe just one quick follow up can you just speak to how the flow trends are tracking in july just so we can think about some of the cadence of flows versus recognizing the industry is still facing some headwinds just from a flow perspective james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 yes so this is jim what i would expect is a more of a continuation at this point i think from a retail perspective i think things are still on the asset management side soft i think youll see that across the industry if you look at the new sims data coming out or will come out i think on institutional its just longer for mandates et cetera but so i dont see a dramatic change at this point now well see what the fed does and well see what the outlook is for various things as we go forward but thats what i would probably say steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful thanks so much for taking my questions operator and thank you our next question is from john barnidge with piper sandler john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you very much with that new guidance around margins in the asset management segment can you maybe talk about the level of composition of variable expenses maybe across the franchise in your businesses thanks walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc again looking at our expense base theres a reasonable portion thats variable but again the exact proportions it gives us the ability to certainly adjust the exact percentages candidly i would have to get back on that because theres investment spending that we do and certainly we have evaluation of hiring and other things on open positions so theres a reasonable amount of variable in there but i dont have the exact percentages in front of me right now john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co and then maybe my followup question is there a way to size the liabilitydriven investing opportunity that seems like thats been a strong area for institutional james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so with the bmo acquisition et cetera they have very good capabilities and now we are looking at those opportunities across the franchise with our expanded level of institutional business and so we feel it will be a good channel as well as a relationship building channel for us john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you operator thank you our next question is from erik bass with autonomous research erik bass q analyst autonomous research ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 hi thank you can you talk about the level of foreign exchange sensitivity in the asset management business post the bmo acquisition and theres clearly impact on revenues and aum but how much of an offset is there in expenses and how should we think about the kind of net earnings impact walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so with bmo obviously we shifted from to and that is sensitive too so approximately in the pti elements of it it was around a million impact to us erik bass q analyst autonomous research million in the quarter walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah thats a net yeah erik bass q analyst autonomous research got it thank you and then you highlighted the billion of excess capital that you have and in past periods of market weakness youve sometimes increased the level of capital return above the target of earnings and leaned into buybacks a bit more is that something that you would consider given the pullback in your stock year to date walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well if i understand your question certainly with the billion we feel comfortable continuing as we indicated hitting our trend line for the for the year and obviously as you look at the back half of the year well be able to certainly with that hitting buyback a lot more shares where the share price was last year versus it is right now hopefully well get back to where it is but where it is right now gives us the ability at that level to buy back more shares erik bass q analyst autonomous research got it but youre not thinking of changing the percentage walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc at this stage we evaluate each quarter but the answer is and well be optimistic as we assess it but were still targeting james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc and remember i think its actually pretty good a lot of companies are pulling back on their buybacks if they were doing them and were doing them at a still very strong rate ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 erik bass q analyst autonomous research yeah no very fair and obviously with the price lower youre buying more shares so appreciate it james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc thank you operator we have our next question from kenneth lee kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning thanks for taking my question just one on the asset management side again curious as to what youre seeing in terms of net flows within the fixed income category just given the industry trends were seeing thanks james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes so what we saw in our business is our net flows were a little on a percentage basis a little worse than where we saw on our equity side and thats mainly because of the mix of business that we have so some other players that might have had larger areas of short duration et cetera we have a short duration business but its not necessarily one that were across all our channels in and so people who had that business saw a little more of the inflow in there than we did because we really were in mortgages and total bond and things such as that a little longer duration products and then the other area that i think probably had some greater flows was more on the leveraged loan area which is only a small business for us so i think it had to do more with mix than anything else but because of being in the type that we were in with the dislocation in the fixed income market as you would imagine redemptions would be up a little more and flows were down municipals was another area that we had a bit of that weakness and based on the market situation but we believe that the areas that we do have now based on the credit quality et cetera will come back we think as interest rates stabilize a little more or as you see on the long end its starting to soften up a little bit kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc great very helpful there and just one related question as my followup more broadly speaking within the asset management side how do you think about the overall product offerings mix the strategies out there any particular gap that you would like to fill at this point thanks james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so what we have now we have a good mix with the bmo acquisition so were putting more energy and time on the esg of the ri part responsible investing were doing more on things like ldi ph and solutions were doing more on alternatives were trying to build out a little more on our retail real estate and property businesses institutional as well and so there are certain things like that that were focused on for what ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 we have in place so we feel good about the mix that we have again were in a little bit of this i think youll look across the asset management industry im not sure youll see a lot of favorability at this point across but i think were in good shape we have good businesses we can manage our expenses were still investing appropriately to get some greater scale efficiencies in the integration with bmo so again were in a little bit of a dislocation market but i think and thats really one of the benefits of the firm like ameriprise were very balanced even where i know on one end someone says risk transfer but we generate some really good solid earnings and cash flow from our ia business activities our awm now with the growth of the bank and complement it gives us a good now offset so i think over time again youll see the strength of how the company really plays out and how we can use this opportunity to really leverage against the whether its having to do with shareholder return or even flexibility kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc great very helpful there thanks again operator and thank you our next question is from ryan krueger with kbw ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning just a follow up on the million of upside from interest rates in full year just given that probably a fair amount of that is coming in the back half of the year are you able to comment on how we should how that might look in as well james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc should look pretty good walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah obviously its walter youre going to get normalization if the fed increases come in which is coming in in the back end and getting the normalization on calendarization thats going to take place there it is dependent of course again what happens to the cash balances and the crediting rate so theres a lot of variables but as jim said youre going to get an increase and certainly we anticipate there will be an increase based on our modeling again from our standpoint it is going to be substantial ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and then just on the asset management margin target you were still a fair amount above that new target in the second quarter is this should we just think about this as a longerterm target or in the current environment would you anticipate being down to within that new target in the near term james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc i think what you have to sort of factor in and again it depends on what happens with markets right you had a bit more of a dislocation of the markets in the second quarter and so as you look at that probably compared to ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2022 where the averages are between the first and the second quarter going into the third you will continue to have a little bit more of that margin compression as theres depreciation on the asset base if you roll it over but having said that i would say that we still feel good about being within those margins after you take that into account so remember markets depreciated and its not just equity markets the fixed income market which is not normal in a sense where you get both of them depreciating at the same time ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thank you operator we have no further questions thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes todays conference thank you for participating you may now disconnect
