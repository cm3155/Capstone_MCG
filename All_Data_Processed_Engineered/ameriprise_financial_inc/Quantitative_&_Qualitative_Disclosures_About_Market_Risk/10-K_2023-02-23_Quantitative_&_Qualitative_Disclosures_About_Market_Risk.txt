item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our primary market risk exposures are interest rate equity price foreign currency exchange rate and credit risk equity price and interest rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on our results of operations primarily due to the effects they have on the asset management and other assetbased fees we earn the spread income generated on our fixed deferred annuities fixed insurance brokerage client cash balances banking deposits faceamount certificate products fixed portion of our variable annuities and variable insurance contracts the value of deferred acquisition costs dac and deferred sales inducement costs dsic assets the value of liabilities for guaranteed benefits associated with our variable annuities and the value of derivatives held to hedge these benefits riversource life has the following variable annuity guarantee benefits guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits gmwb guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits gmab guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb and guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib each of these benefits guarantees payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the underlying invested assets the variable annuity guarantees continue to be managed by utilizing a hedging program which attempts to match the sensitivity of the assets with the sensitivity of the liabilities this approach works with the premise that matched sensitivities will produce a highly effective hedging result our comprehensive hedging program focuses mainly on first order sensitivities of assets and liabilities equity market level delta interest rate level rho and volatility vega additionally various second order sensitivities are managed we use various options swaptions swaps and futures to manage risk exposures the exposures are measured and monitored daily and adjustments to the hedge portfolio are made as necessary we have a macro hedge program to provide protection against the statutory tail scenario risk arising from variable annuity reserves on our statutory surplus and to cover some of the residual risks not covered by other hedging activities we assess the residual risk under a range of scenarios in creating and executing the macro hedge program as a means of economically hedging these risks we may use a combination of futures options swaps and swaptions certain of the macro hedge derivatives used contain settlement provisions linked to both equity returns and interest rates the remaining are interest rate contracts or equity contracts the macro hedge program could result in additional earnings volatility as changes in the value of the macro hedge derivatives which are designed to reduce statutory capital volatility may not be closely aligned to changes in the variable annuity guarantee embedded derivatives to evaluate interest rate and equity price risk we perform sensitivity testing which measures the impact on pretax income from the sources listed below for a 12month period following a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates or a hypothetical decline in equity prices the interest rate risk test assumes a sudden basis point parallel shift in the yield curve with rates then staying at those levels for the next months the equity price risk test assumes a sudden drop in equity prices with equity prices then staying at those levels for the next months in estimating the values of variable annuities indexed annuities stock market certificates indexed universal life iul insurance and the associated hedge assets we assume no change in implied market volatility despite the drop in equity prices the following tables present our estimate of the impact on pretax income from the above defined hypothetical market movements as of december table start equity price decline equity price exposure to pretax income before hedge impact hedge impact net impact in millions

impact the market impact of the macro hedge program is modeled net of any related impact to dac and dsic amortization represents the net impact to pretax income the estimated net impact to pretax adjusted operating income is million the above results compare to an estimated negative net impact to pretax income of million related to a equity price decline and an estimated positive net impact to pretax income of million related to a basis point increase in interest rates as of december the change in interest rate exposure as of december compared to prior yearend was primarily driven by additional downside rate protection added in the macro hedge program net impacts shown in the above table from gmwb riders result largely from differences between the liability valuation basis and the hedging basis liabilities are valued using fair value accounting principles with risk margins incorporated in contractholder behavior assumptions and with discount rates increased to reflect a current market estimate of our risk of nonperformance specific to these liabilities our hedging is based on our determination of economic risk which excludes certain items in the liability valuation including the nonperformance spread risk actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above as they are based on a number of estimates and assumptions these include assuming that implied market volatility does not change when equity prices fall by and that the basis point increase in interest rates is a parallel shift of the yield curve furthermore we have not tried to anticipate changes in client preferences for different types of assets or other changes in client behavior nor have we tried to anticipate all strategic actions management might take to increase revenues or reduce expenses in these scenarios the selection of a basis point interest rate increase as well as a equity price decline should not be construed as a prediction of future market events impacts of larger or smaller changes in interest rates or equity prices may not be proportional to those shown for a basis point increase in interest rates or a decline in equity prices assetbased management and distribution fees we earn assetbased management fees and distribution fees on our assets under management as of december the value of our assets under management was trillion these sources of revenue are subject to both interest rate and equity price risk since the value of these assets and the fees they earn fluctuate inversely with interest rates and directly with equity prices we currently only hedge certain equity price risk for this exposure primarily using futures and swaps we currently do not hedge any of the interest rate risk for this exposure dac and dsic amortization for annuity and ulvariable universal life vul products dac and dsic are amortized on the basis of estimated gross profits egps egps are a proxy for pretax income prior to the recognition of dac and dsic amortization expense when events occur that reduce or increase current period egps dac and dsic amortization expense is typically reduced or increased as well somewhat mitigating the impact of the event on pretax income variable annuity riders the total contract value of all variable annuities as of december was billion these contract values include gmwb and gmab contracts which were billion and billion respectively as of december as of december reserves for gmwb were net liabilities of billion and reserves for gmab were net assets of million the gmwb and gmab reserves include the fair value of embedded derivatives which fluctuates based on equity interest rate and credit markets which can cause these embedded derivatives to be either an asset or a liability as of december the reserve for gmdb and gmib was a net liability of million equity price risk the variable annuity guaranteed benefits guarantee payouts to the annuity holder under certain specific conditions regardless of the performance of the investment assets for this reason when equity prices decline the returns from the separate account assets coupled with guaranteed benefit fees from annuity holders may not be sufficient to fund expected payouts in that case reserves must be increased with a negative impact to earnings the core derivative instruments with which we hedge the equity price risk of our gmwb and gmab provisions are longer dated put and call options these core instruments are supplemented with equity futures and total return swaps see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our derivative instruments interest rate risk the gmab and the nonlife contingent benefits associated with the gmwb provisions create embedded derivatives which are carried at fair value separately from the underlying host variable annuity contract the changes in fair value of the gmwb and gmab liabilities are recorded through earnings with fair value calculated based on projected discounted cash flows over the life of the contract including projected discounted benefits and fees increases in interest rates reduce the fair value of the gmwb and gmab liabilities the gmwb and gmab interest rate exposure is hedged with a portfolio of longer dated put and call options futures interest rate swaps and swaptions we have entered into interest rate swaps according to risk exposures along maturities thus creating both fixed rate payor and variable rate payor terms if interest rates were to increase we would have to pay more to the swap counterparty and the fair value of our equity puts would decrease resulting in a negative impact to our pretax income structured variable annuities structured variable annuities offer the contractholder the ability to allocate premiums to either an account that earns fixed interest fixed account or an account that credits interest based on the performance of various equity indices indexed account subject to a cap floor or buffer our earnings are based upon the spread between investment income earned and the credits made to the fixed and indexed accounts of the structured variable annuities as of december we had billion in liabilities related to structured variable annuities equity price risk the equitylinked return to investors creates equity price risk as the amount credited depends on changes in equity prices the equity price risk for structured variable annuities is evaluated together with the variable annuity riders as part of a hedge program using the derivative instruments consistent with our hedging on variable annuity riders interest rate risk the fair value of the embedded derivative associated with structured variable annuities is based on a discounted cash flow approach changes in interest rates impact the discounting of the embedded derivative liability the spread between the investment income earned and amounts credited to contractholders is also affected by changes in interest rates these interest rate risks associated with structured variable annuities are not currently hedged fixed annuities fixed insurance and fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts our earnings from fixed deferred annuities fixed insurance and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts are based upon the spread between rates earned on assets held and the rates at which interest is credited to accounts we primarily invest in fixed rate securities to fund the rate credited to clients we guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products investment assets and client liabilities generally differ as it relates to basis repricing or maturity characteristics rates credited to clients accounts generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on the underlying investments therefore in an increasing interest rate environment higher interest rates may be reflected in crediting rates to clients sooner than in rates earned on invested assets which could result in a reduced spread between the two rates reduced earned income and a negative impact on pretax income while interest rates under the current environment have relieved some pressure from the liability guaranteed minimum interest rates gmirs there are still some gmirs above current levels hence liability credited rates will move more slowly under a modest rise in interest rates while projected asset purchases would capture the full increase in interest rates this dynamic would result in widening spreads under a modestly rising rate scenario given the current relationship between the current level of interest rates and the underlying gmirs on the business of the billion in policyholder account balances future policy benefits and claims as of december billion is related to liabilities created by these products we do not hedge this exposure as a result of the current market environment reinvestment yields are becoming more aligned with the current portfolio yield we would expect the recent decline in our portfolio income yields to slow and begin to stabilize in future periods if the current environment continues the carrying value and weighted average yield of nonstructured fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgage loans that may generate proceeds to reinvest through due to prepayment maturity or call activity at the option of the issuer excluding securities with a makewhole provision were billion and respectively as of december in addition residential mortgage backed securities which can be subject to prepayment risk under a low interest rate environment totaled billion and had a weighted average yield of as of december while these amounts represent investments that could be subject to reinvestment risk it is also possible that these investments will be used to fund liabilities or may not be prepaid and will remain invested at their current yields in addition to the interest rate environment the mix of benefit payments versus product sales as well as the timing and volumes associated with such mix may impact our investment yield furthermore reinvestment activities and the associated investment yield may also be impacted by corporate strategies implemented at managements discretion the average yield for investment purchases during the year ended december was approximately the reinvestment of proceeds from maturities calls and prepayments at rates near the current portfolio yield will have a limited impact to future operating results in this volatile rate environment we assess reinvestment risk in our investment portfolio and monitor this risk in accordance with our assetliability management framework in addition we may update the crediting rates on our fixed products when warranted subject to guaranteed minimums the following table presents the account values of fixed deferred annuities fixed insurance and the fixed portion of variable annuities and variable insurance contracts by range of gmirs and the range of the difference between rates credited to policyholders and contractholders as of december and the respective guaranteed minimums as well as the percentage of account values subject to rate reset in the time period indicated rates are reset at our discretion subject to guaranteed minimums table start account values with crediting rates at guaranteed minimum bps above guaranteed minimum bps above guaranteed minimum bps above guaranteed minimum total in billions except percentages range of guaranteed minimum crediting rates total percentage of account values that reset in next months months to months months total table end includes contracts with annual discretionary crediting rate resets and contracts with or less months until the crediting rate becomes discretionary on an annual basis includes contracts with more than months remaining until the crediting rate becomes an annual discretionary rate equity indexed annuities our equity indexed annuity eia product is a single premium annuity issued with an initial term of seven years the annuity guarantees the contractholder a minimum return of on of the initial premium or end of prior term accumulation value upon renewal plus a return that is linked to the performance of the sp index the equitylinked return is based on a participation rate initially set at between and of the sp index which is guaranteed for the initial sevenyear term when the contract is held to full term as of december we had million in liabilities related to eias we discontinued new sales of eias in equity price risk the equitylinked return to investors creates equity price risk as the amount credited depends on changes in equity prices to hedge this exposure we purchase futures which generate returns to replicate what we must credit to client accounts interest rate risk most of the proceeds received from eias are invested in fixed income securities with the return on those investments intended to fund the guarantee we earn income from the difference between the return earned on invested assets and the guarantee rate credited to customer accounts the spread between return earned and amount credited is affected by changes in interest rates this risk is not currently hedged and was immaterial as of december banking deposits and brokerage client cash balances we pay interest on banking deposits and certain brokerage client cash balances and have the ability to reset these rates from time to time based on prevailing economic and business conditions we earn revenue to fund the interest paid from interestearning assets or fees from offbalance sheet deposits at federal deposit insurance corporation insured institutions which are indexed to shortterm interest rates in general the change in interest paid lags the change in revenues earned certificate products fixed rate certificates we have interest rate risk from our investment certificates generally ranging in amounts from thousand to million with interest crediting rate terms ranging from to months we guarantee an interest rate to the holders of these products payments collected from clients are primarily invested in fixed income securities to fund the client credited rate with the spread between the rate earned from investments and the rate credited to clients recorded as earned income client liabilities and investment assets generally differ as it relates to basis repricing or maturity characteristics rates credited to clients generally reset at shorter intervals than the yield on underlying investments this exposure is not currently hedged although we monitor our investment strategy and make modifications based on our changing liabilities and the expected interest rate environment of the billion in customer deposits as of december billion related to reserves for our fixed rate certificate products stock market certificates stock market certificates are purchased for amounts generally from thousand to million for terms of weeks weeks or weeks which can be extended to a maximum of years depending on the term for each term the certificate holder can choose to participate in any percentage increase in the sp index up to a maximum return or choose partial participation in any increase in the sp index plus a fixed rate of interest guaranteed in advance if partial participation is selected the total of equitylinked return and guaranteed rate of interest cannot exceed the maximum return liabilities for our stock market certificates are included in customer deposits as of december we had million in reserves related to stock market certificates the equitylinked return to investors creates equity price risk exposure we seek to minimize this exposure with purchased futures and call spreads that replicate what we must credit to client accounts this risk continues to be fully hedged stock market certificates have some interest rate risk as changes in interest rates affect the fair value of the payout to be made to the certificate holder this risk is not currently hedged and was immaterial as of december indexed universal life iul insurance is similar to ul in many regards although the rate of credited interest above the minimum guarantee for funds allocated to an indexed account is linked to the performance of the specified index for the indexed account subject to stated account parameters which include a cap and floor or a spread and floor we offer an sp index account option and a blended multiindex account option comprised of the sp index the msci eafe index and the msci em index both options offer two crediting durations oneyear and twoyear the policyholder may allocate all or a portion of the policy value to a fixed or any available indexed account as of december we had billion in liabilities related to the indexed accounts of iul with the vast majority in the sp index account option equity price risk the equitylinked return to investors creates equity price risk as the amount credited depends on changes in equity prices most of the proceeds received from iul insurance are invested in fixed income securities to hedge the equity exposure a portion of the investment earnings received from the fixed income securities is used to purchase call spreads which generate returns to replicate what we must credit to client accounts interest rate risk as mentioned above most of the proceeds received from iul insurance are invested in fixed income securities with the return on those investments intended to fund the purchase of call spreads and options there are two risks relating to interest rates first we have the risk that investment returns are such that we do not have enough investment income to purchase the needed call spreads second in the event the policy is surrendered we pay out a book value surrender amount and there is a risk that we will incur a loss upon having to sell the fixed income securities backing the liability if interest rates have risen this risk is not currently hedged foreign currency risk we have foreign currency risk through our net investment in foreign subsidiaries and our operations in foreign countries we are primarily exposed to changes in british pounds related to our net investment in threadneedle and bmo global asset management emea which was approximately billion as of december we also have exposure related to operations in foreign countries to euros indian rupees and other currencies we monitor the foreign exchange rates that we have exposure to and enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risk when economically prudent as of december the notional value of outstanding contracts and our remaining foreign currency risk related to operations in foreign countries were not material interest rate risk on external debt the stated interest rate on the billion of our senior unsecured notes is fixed we did not enter into interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert the fixed interest rate on any of the senior unsecured notes to floating interest rates credit risk we are exposed to credit risk within our investment portfolio including our loan portfolio and through our derivative and reinsurance activities credit risk relates to the uncertainty of an obligors continued ability to make timely payments in accordance with the contractual terms of the financial instrument or contract we consider our total potential credit exposure to each counterparty and its affiliates to ensure compliance with preestablished credit guidelines at the time we enter into a transaction which would potentially increase our credit risk these guidelines and oversight of credit risk are managed through a comprehensive enterprise risk management program that includes members of senior management we manage the risk of creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties by applying disciplined fundamental credit analysis and underwriting standards prudently limiting exposures to lowerquality higheryielding investments and diversifying exposures by issuer industry region and underlying investment type we remain exposed to occasional adverse cyclical economic downturns during which default rates may be significantly higher than the longterm historical average used in pricing we manage our credit risk related to overthecounter derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy counterparties maintaining collateral arrangements and through the use of master netting arrangements that provide for a single net payment to be made by one counterparty to another at each due date and upon termination generally our current credit exposure on overthe counter derivative contracts is limited to a derivative counterpartys net positive fair value of derivative contracts after taking into consideration the existence of netting arrangements and any collateral received this exposure is monitored and managed to an acceptable threshold level the counterparty risk for centrally cleared overthecounter derivatives is transferred to a central clearing party through contract novation because the central clearing party monitors open positions and adjusts collateral requirements daily we have minimal credit exposure from such derivative instruments exchangetraded derivatives are effected through regulated exchanges that require contract standardization and initial margin to transact through the exchange because exchangetraded futures are marked to market and generally cash settled on a daily basis we have minimal exposure to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to such derivative instruments other exchangetraded derivatives would be exposed to nonperformance by counterparties for amounts in excess of initial margin requirements only if the exchange is unable to fulfill the contract we manage our credit risk related to reinsurance treaties by evaluating the financial condition of reinsurance counterparties prior to entering into new reinsurance treaties in addition we regularly evaluate their financial strength during the terms of the treaties as of december our largest reinsurance credit risks are related to coinsurance treaties with commonwealth and with life insurance subsidiaries of genworth financial inc see note and note to our consolidated financial statements
