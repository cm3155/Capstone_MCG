be read in conjunction with the forwardlooking statements that follow and our consolidated financial statements and notes presented in item our managements discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our annual report on regulatory capital requirement is based on the applicable regulatory requirement calculated as of june and december actual capital is determined on an adjusted gaap basis acc is required to hold capital in compliance with the minnesota department of commerce and sec capital requirements actual capital and regulatory capital requirements are determined in accordance with uk regulatory legislation the regulatory capital requirements at june represent calculations at december of the rule based requirements as specified by fca regulations regulatory capital requirement is based on minimum requirements for well capitalized banks in accordance with the office of the comptroller of the currency occ ameriprise financial inc in addition to the particular regulations restricting dividend payments and establishing subsidiary capitalization requirements we take into account the overall health of the business capital levels and risk management considerations in determining a strategy for payments to our parent holding company from our subsidiaries and in deciding to use cash to make capital contributions to our subsidiaries during the six months ended june the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of billion including million from riversource life and contributed cash to its subsidiaries of million including million to ameriprise bank fsb during the six months ended june the parent holding company received cash dividends or a return of capital from its subsidiaries of billion including million from riversource life and contributed million to its subsidiaries including million to ameriprise bank fsb in riversource established an agreement to protect its exposure to genworth life insurance company glic for its reinsured ltc in substantial enhancements to this reinsurance protection agreement were finalized the terms of these confidential provisions within the agreement have been shared in the normal course of regular reviews with our domiciliary regulator and rating agencies glic is domiciled in delaware so in the event glic were subjected to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings such proceedings would be located in and governed by delaware laws delaware courts have a long tradition of respecting commercial and reinsurance affairs as well as contracts among sophisticated parties similar credit protections to what we have with glic have been tested and respected in delaware and elsewhere in the united states and as a result we believe our credit protections would be respected even in the unlikely event that glic becomes subject to rehabilitation or insolvency proceedings in delaware accordingly while no credit protections are perfect we believe the correct way to think about the risks represented by our counterparty credit exposure to glic is not the full amount of the gross liability that glic reinsures but a much smaller net exposure to glic if any that might exist after taking into account our credit protections thus management believes that our agreement and offsetting non ltc legacy arrangements with genworth will enable riversource to recover on all net exposure in all material respects in the event of a rehabilitation or insolvency of glic dividends paid to shareholders and share repurchases we paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders totaling million and million for the six months ended june and respectively on july we announced a quarterly dividend of per common share the
