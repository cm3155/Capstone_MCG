remain so we compete in the us and globally for clients market share and human talent operating within the financial services industry on a global basis presents among other things technological risk management regulatory infrastructure and other challenges that require effective resource allocation in order for us to remain competitive our competitive position depends on a number of factors including our reputation client experience the quality and consistency of our longterm investment performance innovation execution relative pricing and other factors including entering into new or expanding current businesses as a result of acquisitions and other strategic initiatives our ability to sustain or improve our competitive position also depends substantially on our ability to

capitalintensive businesses including underwriting and sales trading financing and marketmaking activities also affects our competitive position we expect clients to continue to request that we provide loans or lending commitments in connection with certain investment banking activities it is possible that competition may become even more intense as we continue to compete with financial or other institutions that may be larger or better capitalized or may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history in certain geographies or products many of these firms have the ability to offer a wide range of products and services through different platforms that may enhance their competitive position and could result in additional pricing pressure on our businesses we continue to
