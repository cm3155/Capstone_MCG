provided is included under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations competition all aspects of our businesses are highly competitive and we expect them to remain so we compete in the us and globally for clients market share and human talent operating within the financial services industry on a global basis presents among other things technological risk management regulatory and other infrastructure challenges that require effective resource allocation in order for us to remain competitive our competitive position depends on a number of factors including our reputation the quality and consistency of our longterm investment performance innovation execution and relative pricing our ability to sustain or improve our competitive position also depends substantially on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified employees while managing compensation and other costs we compete with commercial banks brokerage firms insurance companies exchanges electronic trading and clearing platforms financial data repositories sponsors of mutual funds hedge funds and private equity funds energy companies financial technology firms and other companies offering financial or ancillary services in the us globally and digitally including through the internet in addition restrictive laws and regulations applicable to certain financial services institutions which may prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions and impose more stringent capital and liquidity requirements can put us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors in certain businesses not subject to these same requirements see also supervision and regulation herein and risk factors institutional securities and wealth management we compete directly in the us and globally with other securities and financial services firms and brokerdealers and with others on a regional or product basis additionally there is increased competition driven by established firms as well as the emergence of new firms and business models including innovative uses of technology competing for the same clients and assets or offering similar products and services to customers our ability to access capital at competitive rates which is generally impacted by our credit ratings to commit and to deploy capital efficiently particularly in our capitalintensive underwriting and sales trading financing and marketmaking activities also affects our competitive position we expect corporate clients to continue to request that we provide loans or lending commitments in connection with certain investment banking activities it is possible that competition may become even more intense as we continue to compete with financial or other institutions that may be larger or better capitalized or may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history in certain geographies or products many of these firms have the ability to offer a wide range of products and services and on different platforms that may enhance their competitive position and could result in pricing pressure on our businesses we continue to experience intense price competition in some of our businesses in particular the ability to execute securities trades electronically on exchanges and through other automated trading markets has increased the pressure on trading commissions and fees the trend toward direct access to automated electronic markets will likely increase as additional trading moves to more automated platforms it is also possible that we will experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices including in the form of commissions or fees table start december form 10k

national implementation of those standards capital planning and stress testing requirements and recovery and resolution regimes in the us and other jurisdictions some areas of postfinancial crisis regulation are still subject to final rulemaking transition periods or revisions we continue to monitor the changing political tax and regulatory environment it is likely that there will be further changes in the way major financial institutions are regulated in both the us and other markets in which we operate although it remains difficult to predict the exact impact these changes will have on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for a particular future period we expect to remain subject to extensive supervision and regulation financial holding company

recovery planning pursuant to the doddfrank act we are required to periodically submit to the federal reserve and the fdic a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code in the event of our material financial distress or failure our preferred resolution strategy which is set out in our resolution plan is an spoe strategy which generally contemplates the provision of adequate capital and liquidity by the parent company to certain of its subsidiaries so that such subsidiaries have the resources necessary to implement the resolution strategy after the parent company has filed for bankruptcy under a final rule issued by the federal reserve and the fdic we are now required to file resolution plans once every two years with interim updates required in certain limited circumstances the rule also allows us to alternate between submitting a full detailed resolution plan and a streamlined targeted resolution plan our next resolution plan submission is expected to be a targeted resolution plan in the rule also clarifies the information required to be included in our resolution plan further we submit an annual recovery plan to the federal reserve that outlines the steps that management could take over time to generate or conserve financial resources in times of prolonged financial stress certain of our domestic and foreign subsidiaries are also subject to resolution and recovery planning requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate for example the fdic requires certain insured depository institutions idi including our us bank subsidiaries to submit an annual resolution plan that describes the idis strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure of the idi in addition certain financial companies including bhcs such as the firm and certain of its subsidiaries can be subjected to a resolution proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority in title ii of the doddfrank act with the fdic being appointed as receiver provided that certain procedures are met including certain extraordinary financial distress and systemic risk determinations by the us treasury secretary in consultation with the us president the orderly liquidation authority rulemaking is proceeding in stages with some regulations now finalized and others not yet proposed if we were subject to the orderly liquidation authority the fdic would have considerable powers including the power to remove directors and officers responsible for our failure and to appoint new directors and officers the power to assign our assets and liabilities to a third party or bridge financial company without the need for creditor consent or prior court review the ability to differentiate among our creditors including by treating certain creditors within the same class better than others subject to a minimum recovery right on the part of disfavored creditors to receive at least what they would have received in bankruptcy liquidation and broad powers to administer the claims process to determine distributions from the assets of the receivership the fdic has been developing an spoe strategy that could be used to implement the orderly liquidation authority regulators have also taken and proposed various actions to facilitate an spoe strategy under the us bankruptcy code the orderly liquidation authority or other resolution regimes for example the federal reserve and the occ have established rules that impose contractual requirements on certain qualified financial contracts covered qfcs to which us gsibs including us and their subsidiaries including our us bank subsidiaries are parties together the covered entities under these rules covered qfcs must expressly provide that transfer restrictions and default rights against covered entities are limited to the same extent as they would be under the federal deposit insurance act and title ii of the doddfrank act and their implementing regulations and they may not among other things permit the exercise of any crossdefault right against covered entities based on an affiliates entry into
