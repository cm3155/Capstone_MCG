table start table end risk factors for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results and strategic objectives see forwardlooking statements preceding business and return on tangible common equity targets under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our results of operations may be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic and related voluntary and governmentimposed social and business restrictions has impacted global economic conditions resulting in volatility in the global financial markets increased unemployment and operational challenges such as the temporary and permanent closures of businesses shelteringinplace directives and increased remote work protocols governments around the world have been working to develop manufacture and distribute covid19 vaccines and the united states has authorized the targeted distribution of certain covid19 vaccines though it is unclear what the scope and timing of a more comprehensive distribution will be moreover governments and central banks around the world have reacted to the economic crisis caused by the pandemic by implementing stimulus and liquidity programs and cutting interest rates though it is unclear whether these or future actions will be successful in countering the economic disruption if the pandemic continues to be prolonged or the actions of governments and central banks are unsuccessful including actions to facilitate the comprehensive distribution of effective vaccines the adverse impact on the global economy will deepen and our results of operations and financial condition in future quarters may be adversely affected should global market conditions worsen or the pandemic lead to additional market disruptions we could experience reduced client activity and demand for our products and services higher credit and valuation losses in our loan and commitment and investment portfolios impairments of other financial assets and other negative impacts on our financial position including possible constraints on capital and liquidity as well as a higher cost of capital and possible changes or downgrades to our credit ratings in addition continued low interest rates will limit interest margins in our lending businesses across wealth management and institutional securities a slowdown of commercial activity could cause overall sales and trading and investment banking revenues to decline and a decline in assets under management and client balances could also reduce fee and financing revenues across all of our business segments operationally we have initiated a work remotely protocol and restricted business travel of our workforce with a returntoworkplace program which is based on role location and employee willingness and ability to return while we have not experienced a decrease in productivity as a result of the remote work environment there can be no assurance that the transition will not have an adverse effect in the long term if significant portions of our workforce including key personnel are unable to work effectively because of illness government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic the impact of the pandemic on our businesses could be exacerbated the extent to which the covid19 pandemic and the related global economic crisis affects our businesses results of operations and financial condition as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios and our ability to take capital actions will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period the development distribution and acceptance of effective vaccines future actions taken by governmental authorities central banks and other third parties in response to the pandemic and the effects on our customers counterparties employees and thirdparty service providers

prices rates indices volatilities correlations or other market factors such as market liquidity will result in losses for a position or portfolio owned by us for more information on how we monitor and manage market risk see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about riskmarket risk our results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by global and economic conditions and other factors including changes in asset values our results of operations have been in the past and may in the future be materially affected by market fluctuations due to global financial markets economic conditions the effects of the covid19 pandemic or other widespread events such as natural disasters climaterelated incidents or acts of war changes to global trade policies and tariffs and other factors including the level and volatility of equity fixed income and commodity prices the level and term structure of interest rates inflation and currency values and the level of other market indices the results of our institutional securities business segment particularly results relating to our involvement in primary and secondary markets for all types of financial products are subject to substantial market fluctuations due to a variety of factors that we cannot control or predict with great certainty these fluctuations impact results by causing variations in table start december form 10k table end table start table end business flows and activity and in the fair value of securities and other financial products fluctuations also occur due to the level of global market activity which among other things affects the size number and timing of investment banking client assignments and transactions and the realization of returns from our principal investments periods of unfavorable market or economic conditions may have adverse impacts on the level of individual investor participation in the global markets andor the level of client assets and in very low interest rate environments the level of net interest income which would negatively impact the results of our wealth management business segment substantial market fluctuations could also cause variations in the value of our investments in our funds the flow of investment capital into or from aum and the way customers allocate capital among money market equity fixed income or other investment alternatives which could negatively impact our investment management business segment the value of our financial instruments may be materially affected by market fluctuations market volatility illiquid market conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may make it extremely difficult to value and monetize certain of our financial instruments particularly during periods of market displacement subsequent valuations in future periods in light of factors then prevailing may result in significant changes in the values of these instruments and may adversely impact historical or prospective fees and performancebased fees also known as incentive fees which include carried interest in respect of certain businesses in addition at the time of any sales and settlements of these financial instruments the price we ultimately realize will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of our financial instruments which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods in addition financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity under these extreme conditions hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating trading losses as they would be under more normal market conditions moreover under these conditions market participants are particularly exposed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and on a large scale our risk management and monitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate risk to more extreme market moves however severe market events have historically been difficult to predict and we could realize significant losses if extreme market events were to occur holding large and concentrated positions may expose us to losses concentration of risk may reduce revenues or result in losses in our marketmaking investing underwriting including block trading and lending businesses in the event of unfavorable market movements or when market conditions are more favorable for our competitors we commit substantial amounts of capital to these businesses which often results in our taking large positions in the securities of or making large loans to a particular issuer or issuers in a particular industry country or region for further information regarding our country risk exposure see also quantitative and qualitative disclosures about riskcountry and other risks credit risk credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations to us for more information on how we monitor and manage credit risk see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about riskcredit risk we are exposed to the risk that third parties that are indebted to us will not perform their obligations we incur significant credit risk exposure through our institutional securities business segment this risk may arise from a variety of business activities including but not limited to extending credit to clients through various lending commitments entering into swap or other derivative contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make payments to us providing short or longterm funding that is secured by physical or financial collateral whose value may at times be insufficient to fully cover the loan repayment amount posting margin andor collateral and other commitments to clearing houses clearing agencies exchanges banks securities firms and other financial counterparties and investing and trading in securities and loan pools whereby the value of these assets may fluctuate based on realized or expected defaults on the underlying obligations or loans we also incur credit risk in our wealth management business segment lending to mainly individual investors including but not limited to margin and securitiesbased loans collateralized by securities residential mortgage loans and helocs our valuations related to and reserves for losses on credit exposures rely on complex models estimates and subjective judgments about the future while we believe current valuations and reserves adequately address our perceived levels of risk future economic conditions that differ from or are more severe than forecast inaccurate models or assumptions or external factors such as natural disasters or the ongoing covid19 pandemic could lead to inaccurate measurement of or deterioration of credit quality of our table start december form 10k table end table start table end borrowers and counterparties or the value of collateral and result in unexpected losses we may also incur higher than anticipated credit losses in periods of market illiquidity or as a result of disputes with counterparties over the valuation of collateral during periods of economic stress in addition in the longer term climate change may also have a negative impact on the financial condition of our clients which may decrease revenues from those clients and increase the credit risk associated with loans and other credit exposures to those clients certain of our credit exposures are concentrated by product industry or country although our models and estimates account for correlations among related types of exposures a change in the market environment for a concentrated product or an external factor impacting a concentrated industry or country may result in credit losses in excess of amounts forecast concentrations of credit risk are managed through the firms comprehensive and global credit limits framework in addition as a clearing member of several central counterparties we are responsible for the defaults or misconduct of our customers and could incur financial losses in the event of default by other clearing members although we regularly review our credit exposures default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect or foresee a default by a large financial institution could adversely affect financial markets the commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit trading clearing or other relationships among the institutions increased centralization of trading activities through particular clearing houses central agents or exchanges as required by provisions of the doddfrank act may increase our concentration of risk with respect to these entities as a result concerns about or a default or threatened default by one institution could lead to significant marketwide liquidity and credit problems losses or defaults by other institutions this is sometimes referred to as systemic risk and may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing houses clearing agencies exchanges banks and securities firms with which we interact on a daily basis and therefore could adversely affect us see also systemic risk regime under businesssupervision and regulationfinancial holding company operational risk operational risk refers to the risk of loss or of damage to our reputation resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems from human factors or from external events eg fraud theft legal and compliance risks cyber attacks damage to physical assets or the ongoing covid19 pandemic we may incur operational risk across the full scope of our business activities including revenuegenerating activities eg sales and trading and support and control groups eg information technology and trade processing legal regulatory and compliance risk is included in the scope of operational risk and is discussed below under legal regulatory and compliance risk for more information on how we monitor and manage operational risk see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about riskoperational risk we are subject to operational risks including a failure breach or other disruption of our operations or security systems or those of our third parties or third parties thereof as well as human error or malfeasance which could adversely affect our businesses or reputation our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and report on a daily basis a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies we may introduce new products or services or change processes or reporting including in connection with new regulatory requirements resulting in new operational risk that we may not fully appreciate or identify the trend toward direct access to automated electronic markets and the move to more automated trading platforms has resulted in the use of increasingly complex technology that relies on the continued effectiveness of the programming code and integrity of the data to process the trades we rely on the ability of our employees consultants our internal systems and systems at technology centers maintained by unaffiliated third parties to operate our different businesses and process a high volume of transactions unusually high trading volumes or site usage could cause our systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail disruptions to destruction of instability of or other failure to effectively maintain our information technology systems or external technology that allows our clients and customers to use our products and services including our selfdirected brokerage platform could harm our business and our reputation additionally we are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations governing cybersecurity privacy and data protection which may differ and potentially conflict in various jurisdictions as a major participant in the global capital markets we face the risk of incorrect valuation or risk management of our trading positions due to flaws in data models electronic trading systems or processes or due to fraud or cyber attack we also face the risk of operational failure or disruption of any of the clearing agents exchanges clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our lending securities and derivatives transactions in addition in the event of a breakdown or improper operation or disposal of our or a direct or indirect third partys systems or third parties thereof processes or information assets or improper or unauthorized action by third parties including consultants and subcontractors or our employees we could suffer financial loss an impairment to our liquidity position a disruption of table start december form 10k table end table start table end our businesses regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation in addition the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents exchanges and clearing houses and the increased importance of these entities increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industrywide operational failure that could materially impact our ability to conduct business furthermore the concentration of company and personal information held by a handful of third parties increases the risk that a breach at a key third party may cause an industrywide data breach that could significantly increase the cost and risk of conducting business there can be no assurance that our business contingency and security response plans fully mitigate all potential risks to us our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities where we are located which are concentrated in the new york and atlanta metropolitan areas london hong kong and tokyo as well as baltimore glasgow frankfurt bangalore budapest and mumbai this may include a disruption involving physical site access software flaws and vulnerabilities cybersecurity incidents terrorist activities political unrest other disease pandemics catastrophic events climaterelated incidents and natural disasters such as earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes and wildfires electrical outage environmental hazard computer servers communications or other services we use our employees or third parties with whom we conduct business although we employ backup systems for our data those backup systems may be unavailable following a disruption the affected data may not have been backed up or may not be recoverable from the backup or the backup data may be costly to recover which could adversely affect our business notwithstanding evolving technology and technologybased risk and control systems our businesses ultimately rely on people including our employees and those of third parties with which we conduct business as a result of human error or engagement in violations of applicable policies laws rules or procedures certain errors or violations are not always discovered immediately by our technological processes or by our controls and other procedures which are intended to prevent and detect such errors or violations these can include calculation errors mistakes in addressing emails or other communications errors in software or model development or implementation or errors in judgment as well as intentional efforts to disregard or circumvent applicable policies laws rules or procedures human errors and malfeasance even if promptly discovered and remediated can result in material losses and liabilities for us we conduct business in various jurisdictions outside the us including jurisdictions that may not have comparable levels of protection for their corporate assets such as intellectual property trademarks trade secrets knowhow and customer information and records the protection afforded in those jurisdictions may be less established andor predictable than in the us or other jurisdictions in which we operate as a result there may also be heightened risks associated with the potential theft of their data technology and intellectual property in those jurisdictions by domestic or foreign actors including private parties and those affiliated with or controlled by state actors any theft of data technology or intellectual property may negatively impact our operations and reputation including disrupting the business activities of our subsidiaries affiliates joint ventures or clients conducting business in those jurisdictions a cyber attack information or security breach or a technology failure could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business manage our exposure to risk or result in disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information and otherwise adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition as well as cause reputational harm we maintain a significant amount of personal information on our customers clients employees and certain counterparties that we are required to protect under various state federal and international data protection and privacy laws these laws may be in conflict with one another or courts and regulators may interpret them in ways that we had not anticipated or that adversely affect our business cybersecurity risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet mobile telecommunications and cloud technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external extremist parties including foreign state actors in some circumstances as a means to promote political ends in addition to the growing sophistication of certain parties the commoditization of cyber tools which are able to be weaponized by less sophisticated actors has led to an increase in the exploitation of technological vulnerabilities global events and geopolitical instability may lead to increased nation state targeting of financial institutions in the us and abroad foreign state actors have become more sophisticated over time increasing the risk of such an attack any of these parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers clients vendors or other third parties or users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our employees or clients cybersecurity risks may also derive from human error fraud or malice on the part of our employees or third parties including third party providers or may result from accidental technological failure these risks may be heightened by several factors including for example the covid19 pandemic which has caused the majority of our employees to work remotely and access our secure networks through their home networks or as a result of the integration of acquisitions and other strategic initiatives that may subject us to new table start december form 10k table end table start table end technology customers or third party providers in addition third parties with whom we do business the regulators with whom we share information and each of their service providers as well as the third parties with whom our customers and clients share information used for authentication may also be sources of cybersecurity risks particularly where activities of customers are beyond our security and control systems there is no guarantee that the measures we take will provide absolute security or recoverability given the techniques used in cyber attacks are complex and frequently change and may not be able to be anticipated like other financial services firms the firm its third party providers and its clients continue to be the subject of unauthorized access attacks mishandling or misuse of information computer viruses or malware cyber attacks designed to obtain confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service sabotage systems or cause other damage denial of service attacks data breaches social engineering attacks and other events there can be no assurance that such unauthorized access mishandling or misuse of information or cyber incidents will not occur in the future and they could occur more frequently and on a more significant scale a cyber attack information or security breach or a technology failure of ours or of a third party could jeopardize our or our clients employees partners vendors or counterparties personal confidential proprietary or other information processed and stored in and transmitted through our and our third parties computer systems furthermore such events could cause interruptions or malfunctions in our our clients employees partners vendors counterparties or third parties operations as well as the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information of ours our employees our customers or of other third parties any of these events could result in reputational damage with our clients and the market client dissatisfaction additional costs to us to maintain and update our operational and security systems and infrastructure regulatory investigations litigation or enforcement or regulatory fines or penalties any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations given our global footprint and the high volume of transactions we process the large number of clients partners vendors and counterparties with which we do business and the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks a cyber attack information or security breach could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection we expect that any investigation of a cyber attack would be inherently unpredictable and that it would take time before the completion of any investigation and before there is availability of full and reliable information during such time we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated all or any of which would further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack while many of our agreements with partners and third party vendors include indemnification provisions we may not be able to recover sufficiently or at all under such provisions to adequately offset any losses we may incur in addition although we maintain insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions cover certain aspects of cyber and information security risks such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses we continue to make investments with a view toward maintaining and enhancing our cybersecurity posture the cost of managing cyber and information security risks and attacks along with complying with new increasingly expansive and evolving regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and business liquidity risk liquidity risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to finance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets or difficulty in liquidating our assets liquidity risk also encompasses our ability or perceived ability to meet our financial obligations without experiencing significant business disruption or reputational damage that may threaten our viability as a going concern as well as the associated funding risks triggered by the market or idiosyncratic stress events that may negatively affect our liquidity and may impact our ability to raise new funding

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about riskliquidity risk liquidity is essential to our businesses and we rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our operations liquidity is essential to our businesses our liquidity could be negatively affected by our inability to raise funding in the longterm or shortterm debt capital markets our inability to access the secured lending markets or unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral by customers or clients factors that we cannot control such as disruption of the financial markets or negative views about the financial services industry generally including concerns regarding fiscal matters in the us and other geographic areas could impair our ability to raise funding in addition our ability to raise funding could be impaired if investors or lenders develop a negative perception of our longterm or shortterm financial prospects due to factors such as an incurrence of large trading losses a downgrade by the rating agencies a decline in the level of our business activity if regulatory authorities take significant action against us or table start december form 10k table end table start table end our industry or we discover significant employee misconduct or illegal activity if we are unable to raise funding using the methods described above we would likely need to finance or liquidate unencumbered assets such as our investment portfolios or trading assets to meet maturing liabilities or other obligations we may be unable to sell some of our assets or we may have to sell assets at a discount to market value either of which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition our borrowing costs and access to the debt capital markets depend on our credit ratings the cost and availability of unsecured financing generally are impacted by our longterm and shortterm credit ratings the rating agencies continue to monitor certain companyspecific and industrywide factors that are important to the determination of our credit ratings these include governance the level and quality of earnings capital adequacy liquidity and funding risk appetite and management asset quality strategic direction business mix regulatory or legislative changes macroeconomic environment and perceived levels of support and it is possible that they could downgrade our ratings and those of similar institutions our credit ratings also can have an adverse impact on certain trading revenues particularly in those businesses where longer term counterparty performance is a key consideration such as otc and other derivative transactions including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps in connection with certain otc trading agreements and certain other agreements associated with our institutional securities business segment we may be required to provide additional collateral to or immediately settle any outstanding liability balance with certain counterparties in the event of a credit ratings downgrade termination of our trading and other agreements could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash payments or securities movements the additional collateral or termination payments which may occur in the event of a future credit rating downgrade vary by contract and can be based on ratings by either or both of moodys investors service inc and sp global ratings see also managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and

brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to laws regulations and selfregulatory organization rules that limit as well as authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to the parent company or that prohibit such transfers or dividends altogether in certain circumstances including steps to ring fence entities by regulators outside of the us to protect clients and creditors of such entities in the event of financial difficulties involving such entities these laws regulations and rules may hinder our ability to access funds that we may need to make payments on our obligations

circumstances the duty to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including us and our us bank subsidiaries our liquidity and financial condition have

our cost and availability of funding in the past have been and may in the future be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads significant turbulence in the us the eu and

expand our product offerings and pursue certain investments the firm and its employees are subject to among other things wideranging regulation and supervision intensive scrutiny of our businesses and

require changes to business practices or force us to discontinue businesses adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our stock or require us to raise capital including in ways that

that we are subject to in the us and may adversely affect us legal and regulatory requirements continue to be subject to ongoing change which may result in significant new costs to comply with new or revised requirements as well as to monitor for compliance on an ongoing basis the application of regulatory requirements and strategies in the us or other jurisdictions to facilitate the orderly resolution of large financial institutions may pose a greater risk of loss for our security holders and subject us to other restrictions pursuant to the doddfrank act we are required to periodically submit to the federal reserve and the fdic a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the us bankruptcy code in the event of material financial distress or failure if the federal reserve and the fdic were to jointly determine that our resolution plan submission was not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution and if we were unable to address any deficiencies identified by the regulators we or any of our subsidiaries may be subject to more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth activities or operations or after a twoyear period we may be required to divest assets or operations in addition provided that certain procedures are met we can be subject to a resolution proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority under title ii of the doddfrank act with the fdic being appointed as receiver the fdics power under the orderly liquidation authority to disregard the priority of creditor claims and treat similarly situated creditors differently in certain circumstances subject to certain limitations could adversely impact holders of our unsecured debt see businesssupervision and regulation and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources regulatory requirements further because both our resolution plan contemplates an spoe strategy under the us bankruptcy code and the fdic has proposed an spoe strategy through which it may apply its orderly liquidation authority powers we believe that the application of an spoe strategy is the reasonably likely outcome if either our resolution plan were implemented or a resolution proceeding were commenced under the orderly liquidation authority an spoe strategy generally contemplates the provision of adequate capital and liquidity by the parent company to certain of its subsidiaries so that such subsidiaries have the resources necessary to implement the resolution strategy and the parent company has entered into a secured amended and restated support agreement with its material entities as defined in our resolution plan pursuant to which it would provide such capital and liquidity to such entities in further development of our spoe strategy we have created a wholly owned direct subsidiary of the parent company morgan stanley holdings llc funding ihc to serve as a resolution funding vehicle the parent company has transferred and has agreed to transfer on an ongoing basis certain assets to the funding ihc in the event of a resolution scenario the parent company would be obligated to contribute all of its material assets that can be contributed under the terms of the amended and restated support agreement other than shares in subsidiaries of the parent company and certain other assets contributable assets to the funding ihc the funding ihc would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity as applicable to our material entities the obligations of the parent company and the funding ihc under the amended and restated support agreement are in most cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the parent company other than shares in subsidiaries of the table start december form 10k table end table start table end parent company and certain other assets and the assets of the funding ihc as a result claims of our material entities including the funding ihc against the assets of the parent company with respect to such secured assets are effectively senior to unsecured obligations of the parent company although an spoe strategy whether applied pursuant to our resolution plan or in a resolution proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority is intended to result in better outcomes for creditors overall there is no guarantee that the application of an spoe strategy including the provision of support to the parent companys material entities pursuant to the secured amended and restated support agreement will not result in greater losses for holders of our securities compared to a different resolution strategy for us regulators have taken and proposed various actions to facilitate an spoe strategy under the us bankruptcy code the orderly liquidation authority and other resolution regimes for example the federal reserve requires toptier bhcs of us gsibs including the firm to maintain minimum amounts of equity and eligible longterm debt tlac in order to ensure that such institutions have enough lossabsorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of debt to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible tlac where the spoe strategy is used the combined implication of the spoe resolution strategy and the tlac requirement is that our losses will be imposed on the holders of eligible longterm debt and other forms of eligible tlac issued by the parent company before any losses are imposed on the creditors of our material entities or before putting us taxpayers at risk in addition certain jurisdictions including the uk and other eu jurisdictions have implemented or are in the process of implementing changes to resolution regimes to provide resolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing entity organized in such jurisdiction by writing down certain unsecured liabilities or converting certain unsecured liabilities into equity such bailin powers are intended to enable the recapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to its shareholders and unsecured creditors nonus regulators are also considering requirements that certain subsidiaries of large financial institutions maintain minimum amounts of tlac that would pass losses up from the subsidiaries to the parent company and ultimately to security holders of the parent company in the event of failure we may be prevented from paying dividends or taking other capital actions because of regulatory constraints or revised regulatory capital standards we are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision regulation and examination by the federal reserve including with respect to regulatory capital standards stress testing and capital planning we submit on at least an annual basis a capital plan to the federal reserve describing proposed dividend payments to shareholders proposed repurchases of our outstanding securities and other proposed capital actions that we intend to take our ability to take capital actions described in the capital plan is dependent on among other factors the results of supervisory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve and our compliance with regulatory capital standards imposed by the federal reserve in addition the federal reserve may change regulatory capital standards to impose higher requirements that restrict our ability to take capital actions or may modify or impose other regulatory standards or restrictions that increase our operating expenses or constrain our ability to take capital actions for example on june the federal reserve announced that it would bar share repurchases and limit common stock dividend payments in the third quarter of for all large bhcs and on september the restrictions were extended through the fourth quarter of on december the federal reserve announced that it was extending capital action supervisory restrictions applicable to all large bhcs into the first quarter of with modifications to permit resumptions of share repurchases the federal reserve may extend or further modify these restrictions in future periods or impose new restrictions for additional information see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital

legal liability as a global financial services firm we face the risk of investigations and proceedings by governmental and selfregulatory organizations in all countries in which we conduct our business investigations and proceedings initiated by these authorities may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief in addition to the monetary consequences these measures could for example impact our ability to engage in or impose limitations on certain of our businesses these investigations and proceedings as well as the amount of penalties and fines sought continue to impact the financial services industry and certain us and international governmental entities have brought criminal actions against or have sought criminal convictions pleas or deferred prosecution agreements from financial institutions significant regulatory or law enforcement action against us could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations or cause us significant reputational harm which could seriously harm our business the doddfrank act also provides compensation to whistleblowers who present the sec or cftc with information related to securities or commodities law violations that leads to a successful enforcement action as a result of this compensation it is possible we could face an increased number of investigations by

warranties under certain circumstances we may be required to repurchase such assets or make other payments related to such assets if such representations and warranties were breached we have also made representations and warranties in connection with our role as an originator of certain commercial mortgage loans that we securitized in cmbs for additional information see also note to the financial statements we currently have several legal proceedings related to claims for alleged breaches of representations and warranties if there are decisions adverse to us in those legal proceedings we may incur losses substantially in excess of our reserves in addition our reserves are based in part on certain factual and legal assumptions if those assumptions are incorrect and need to be revised we may need to adjust our reserves substantially a failure to address conflicts of interest appropriately could adversely affect our businesses and reputation as a global financial services firm that provides products and services to a large and diversified group of clients including corporations governments financial institutions and individuals we face potential conflicts of interest in the normal course of business for example potential conflicts can occur when there is a divergence of interests between us and a client among clients between an employee on the one hand and us or a client on the other or situations in which we may be a creditor of a client moreover we also utilize multiple brands and business channels including those resulting from our acquisitions and continue to enhance the collaboration across business segments which may heighten the potential conflicts of interests or the risk of improper sharing of information we have policies procedures and controls that are designed to identify and address potential conflicts of interest and we utilize various measures such as the use of disclosure to manage these potential conflicts however identifying and mitigating potential conflicts of interest can be complex and challenging and can become the focus of media and regulatory scrutiny indeed actions that merely appear to create a conflict can put our reputation at risk even if the likelihood of an actual conflict has been mitigated it is possible that potential conflicts could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions which may lead to our clients being less willing to enter into transactions in which a conflict may occur and could adversely affect our businesses and reputation our regulators have the ability to scrutinize our activities for potential conflicts of interest including through detailed examinations of specific transactions for example our status as a bhc supervised by the federal reserve subjects us to direct federal reserve scrutiny with respect to transactions between our us bank subsidiaries and their affiliates further the volcker rule subjects us to regulatory scrutiny regarding certain transactions between us and our clients risk management our risk management strategies models and processes may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposures in all market environments or against all types of risk which could result in unexpected losses we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management capabilities and expect to continue to do so in the future nonetheless our risk management strategies models and processes including our use of various risk models for assessing market exposures and hedging strategies stress testing and other analysis may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated as our businesses change and grow and the markets in which we operate evolve our risk management strategies models and processes may not always adapt with those changes some of our methods of managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior and managements judgment as a result these methods may not predict future risk exposures which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate table start december form 10k table end table start table end in addition many models we use are based on assumptions or inputs regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators and therefore cannot anticipate sudden unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements such as the impact of the covid19 pandemic which could cause us to incur losses management of market credit liquidity operational model legal regulatory and compliance risks requires among other things policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective our trading risk management strategies and techniques also seek to balance our ability to profit from trading positions with our exposure to potential losses while we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the timing of such outcomes for example to the extent that our trading or investing activities involve less liquid trading markets or are otherwise subject to restrictions on sales or hedging we may not be able to reduce our positions and therefore reduce our risk associated with such positions we may therefore incur losses in the course of our trading or investing activities for more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks and related strategies models and processes see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about riskmarket risk planned replacement of london interbank offered rate and replacement or reform of other interest rate benchmarks could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations central banks around the world including the federal reserve have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives to replace libor and replace or reform other interest rate benchmarks collectively the ibors a transition away from the widespread use of such rates to alternative rates and other potential interest rate benchmark reforms has begun and will continue over the course of the next few years there remains a likelihood that most ibors will not be available beyond and regulators globally have continued to emphasize the need for the industry to plan accordingly the federal reserve bank of new york now publishes the secured overnight financing rate based on overnight us treasury repurchase agreement transactions which has been recommended as the alternative to us dollar libor by the alternative reference rates committee convened by the federal reserve and the federal reserve bank of new york

group on sterling riskfree reference rates as the alternative rate to sterling libor central banksponsored committees in other jurisdictions including europe japan and switzerland have selected alternative reference rates denominated in other currencies the market transition away from ibors to alternative reference rates is complex and could have a range of adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations in particular such transition or reform could adversely impact the pricing liquidity value of return on and trading for a broad array of financial products including any iborlinked securities loans and derivatives that are included in our financial assets and liabilities require extensive changes to documentation that governs or references ibor or iborbased products including for example pursuant to timeconsuming renegotiations of existing documentation to modify the terms of outstanding securities and related hedging transactions result in a population of products with documentation that governs or references ibor or iborbased products but that cannot be amended due to an inability to obtain sufficient consent from counterparties or product owners result in inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our or the markets preparation and readiness for the replacement of an ibor with one or more alternative reference rates result in disputes litigation or other actions with clients counterparties and investors in various scenarios such as regarding the interpretation and enforceability of provisions in iborbased products such as fallback language or other related provisions including in the case of fallbacks to the alternative reference rates any economic legal operational or other impact resulting from the fundamental differences between the ibors and the various alternative reference rates require the transition andor development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from ibors to those based on one or more alternative reference rates in a timely manner including by quantifying value and risk for various alternative reference rates which may prove challenging given the limited history of the proposed alternative reference rates and cause us to incur additional costs in relation to any of the above factors other factors include the pace of the transition to the alternative reference rates timing mismatches between cash and derivative markets the specific terms and parameters for and market acceptance of any alternative reference rate market conventions for the use of any alternative reference rate in connection with a particular product including the timing and market adoption of any conventions proposed or recommended by any industry or other group prices of and the liquidity of trading markets for products based on alternative reference rates and our ability to transition and develop appropriate systems and analytics for one or more alternative reference rates table start december form 10k table end table start table end see also managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of

adversely affect our revenue and profitability the financial services industry and all aspects of our businesses are intensely competitive and we expect them to remain so we compete with commercial banks brokerage firms insurance companies exchanges electronic trading and clearing platforms financial data repositories sponsors of mutual funds hedge funds fund managers energy companies financial technology firms and other companies offering financial or ancillary services in the us globally and digitally or through the internet we compete on the basis of several factors including transaction execution capital or access to capital products and services innovation technology reputation risk appetite and price over time certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have left businesses been acquired by or merged into other firms or have declared bankruptcy such changes could result in our remaining competitors gaining greater capital and other resources such as the ability to offer a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity or new competitors may emerge we have experienced and may continue to experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices eliminating commissions or other fees or providing more favorable terms of business in addition certain of our competitors may be subject to different and in some cases less stringent legal and regulatory regimes than we are thereby putting us at a competitive disadvantage some new competitors in the financial technology sector have sought to target existing segments of our businesses that could be susceptible to disruption by innovative or less regulated business models for more information regarding the competitive environment in which we operate see businesscompetition and businesssupervision and regulation automated trading markets and the introduction and application of new technologies may adversely affect our business and may increase competition we have experienced intense price competition in some of our businesses in recent years in particular the ability to execute securities derivatives and other financial instrument trades electronically on exchanges swap execution facilities other automated trading platforms and the introduction and application of new technologies has increased the pressure on bidoffer spreads commissions markups or comparable fees the trend toward direct access to automated electronic markets will likely continue and will likely increase as additional markets move to more automated trading platforms we have experienced and it is likely that we will continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors may seek to obtain market share by reducing or eliminating bidoffer spreads commissions markups or fees our ability to retain and attract qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance our people are our most important asset and competition for qualified employees is intense if we are unable to continue to attract and retain highly qualified employees or do so at levels or in forms necessary to maintain our competitive position or if compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more expensive our performance including our competitive position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected the financial industry has experienced and may continue to experience more stringent regulation of employee compensation including limitations relating to incentivebased compensation clawback requirements and special taxation which could have an adverse effect on our ability to hire or retain the most qualified employees international risk we are

many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the securities and financial services industries are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of

such uncertainty may adversely affect the manner in which we operate certain of our businesses in europe on january the uk withdrew from the eu under the terms of a withdrawal agreement between the uk and the eu the withdrawal agreement provided for a transition period to the end of december during which time the uk would continue to apply eu law as if it were a member state and uk firms passporting rights to provide financial services in eu jurisdictions continued on december the uk and the eu announced they had reached agreement on the terms of a trade and cooperation agreement to govern the future relationship between the parties the agreement consists of three main pillars including trade citizens security and governance covering a variety of arrangements in several areas the agreement is provisionally applicable with effect from january pending formal ratification by the eu with respect to financial services although the uk chose to grant the eu equivalence in a number of key areas under european financial regulations the eu only made certain more limited equivalence decisions leaving decisions on equivalence and adequacy to be determined by each of the uk and eu unilaterally in due course as a result uk licensed entities are unable to provide regulated services in a number of eu jurisdictions from the end of december absent regulatory relief or other measures implemented by individual countries while we have restructured our european operations to ensure that we can continue to provide crossborder banking and investment and other services in eu member
