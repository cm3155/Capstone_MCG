statements we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note to the financial statements the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity fair value financial instruments measured at fair value a significant number of our financial instruments are carried at fair value the use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting estimate we make estimates regarding the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the financial statements these assets and liabilities include but are not limited to trading assets and trading liabilities investment securitiesafs certain securities purchased under agreements to resell loans heldforsale measured at the lower of amortized cost or fair value certain deposits primarily certificates of deposit certain securities sold under agreements to repurchase certain other secured financings and certain borrowings fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in determining fair value we use various valuation approaches a hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when available the hierarchy is broken down into three levels wherein level represents quoted prices in active markets level represents valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable and level consists of valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs and therefore require the greatest use of judgment the fair values for the substantial majority of our financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in level or of the fair value hierarchy level financial assets represented and of our total assets as of december and december respectively in periods of market disruption the observability of prices and inputs as well as market liquidity may be reduced for many instruments which could cause an instrument to be recategorized from level to level or from level to level in addition a downturn in market conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of many instruments carried at fair value imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position the firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value the use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date for further information on the definition of fair value level level level and related valuation techniques and quantitative information about and sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs used in level fair value measurements see notes and to the financial statements where appropriate valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk bidask adjustments credit quality model uncertainty concentration risk and funding in order to arrive at fair value for a further discussion of valuation adjustments that we apply see note to the financial statements goodwill and intangible assets goodwill we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of july and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist evaluating goodwill for impairment requires management to make significant judgments including in part the use of unobservable inputs that are subject to uncertainty goodwill impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level which is generally at the level of or one level below our business segments goodwill no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a reporting unit as such all the activities of a reporting unit whether acquired or organically developed are available to support the value of the goodwill for both the annual and interim tests we have the option to either i perform a quantitative impairment test or ii first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in which case the quantitative test would be performed when performing a quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the goodwill impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value table start december form 10k table end table start managements discussion and analysis table end limited by the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit the carrying value of each reporting unit is determined based on the capital allocated to the reporting unit the estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each of the reporting units the estimated fair value is generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology in certain instances we may also utilize methodologies that incorporate pricetobook and pricetoearnings multiples of comparable companies the discounted cash flow methodology uses projected future cash flows based on the reporting units earnings forecast the discount rate used represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit based on the capital asset pricing model at each annual goodwill impairment testing date each of our reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value intangible assets intangible assets are initially recorded at cost or in the situation where acquired as part of a business combination at the fair value determined as part of the acquisition method of accounting subsequently amortizable intangible assets are carried in the balance sheet at amortized cost where amortization is recognized over their estimated useful lives indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis as of july and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist on a quarterly basis all intangible assets are assessed for the presence of impairment indicators where such indicators are present an evaluation for impairment is conducted for amortizable intangible assets an impairment loss exists if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows for indefinitelived intangible assets an impairment exists if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value amortizable intangible assets are assessed for any indication that the remaining useful life or the finite life classification should be revised in such cases the remaining carrying amount is amortized prospectively over the revised useful life unless it is determined that the life of the intangible asset is indefinite in which case the intangible asset is not amortized indefinitelived intangible assets are assessed for any indication that the life of the intangible asset is no longer indefinite in such cases the carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over its remaining useful life the initial valuation of an intangible asset as part of the acquisition method of accounting and the subsequent valuation of intangible assets as part of an impairment assessment are subjective and based in part on inputs that are unobservable and can be subject to uncertainty these inputs include but are not limited to forecasted cash flows revenue growth rates customer attrition rates and discount rates for both goodwill and intangible assets to the extent an impairment loss is recognized the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted for amortizable intangible assets the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset unanticipated declines in our revenue generating capability adverse market or economic events and regulatory actions could result in material impairment charges in future periods see notes and to the financial statements for additional information about goodwill and intangible assets legal and regulatory contingencies in the normal course of business we have been named from time to time as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our activities as a global diversified financial services institution certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory andor punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages in some cases the thirdparty entities that are or would otherwise be the

excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency we are often unable to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or range of loss it is particularly difficult to determine if a loss is probable or reasonably possible or to estimate the amount of loss where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government

laws of the us its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have business operations these tax laws are complex and subject to interpretation by the taxpayer and

taxable income when determining the provision for income taxes in the various tax jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit we periodically evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each taxing jurisdiction resulting from current and subsequent years examinations and unrecognized tax benefits related to potential losses that may arise from tax audits are established in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance once established unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change our provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse our deferred tax balances may also include deferred assets related to tax attribute carryforwards such as net operating losses and tax credits that will be realized through reduction of future tax liabilities and in some cases are subject to expiration if not utilized within certain periods we perform regular reviews to ascertain whether deferred tax assets are realizable these reviews include managements estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income and incorporate various tax planning strategies including strategies that may be available to tax attribute carryforwards before they expire once the deferred tax asset balances have been determined we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset balances to reflect the amount we estimate is more likely than not to be realized at a future date both current and deferred income taxes may reflect adjustments related to our unrecognized tax benefits significant judgment is required in estimating the consolidated provision for benefit from income taxes current and deferred tax balances including valuation allowance

across a wide range of market conditions and time horizons the framework is designed to enable us to fulfill our financial obligations and support the execution of our business strategies the following principles guide our liquidity risk management framework sufficient liquidity resources which consist of hqla and cash deposits with banks liquidity resources should be maintained to cover maturing liabilities and other planned and contingent outflows maturity profile of assets and liabilities should be aligned with limited reliance on shortterm funding source counterparty currency region and term of funding should be diversified and liquidity stress tests should anticipate and account for periods of limited access to funding the core components of our liquidity risk management framework are the required liquidity framework liquidity stress tests and liquidity resources which support our target liquidity profile required liquidity framework our required liquidity framework establishes the amount of liquidity we must hold in both normal and stressed environments to ensure that our financial condition and overall soundness are not adversely affected by an inability or perceived inability to meet our financial obligations in a timely manner the required liquidity framework considers the most constraining liquidity requirement to satisfy all regulatory and internal limits at a consolidated and legal entity level liquidity stress tests we use liquidity stress tests to model external and intercompany liquidity flows across multiple scenarios and a range of time horizons these scenarios contain various combinations of idiosyncratic and systemic stress events of different severity and duration the methodology implementation production and analysis of our liquidity stress tests are important components of the required liquidity framework the assumptions used in our various liquidity stress test scenarios include but are not limited to the following no government support no access to equity and limited access to unsecured debt markets table start december form 10k table end table start managements discussion and analysis table end repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within the stress horizon higher haircuts for and significantly lower availability of secured funding additional collateral that would be required by trading counterparties certain exchanges and clearing organizations related to credit rating downgrades additional collateral that would be required due to collateral substitutions collateral disputes and uncalled collateral discretionary unsecured debt buybacks drawdowns on lending commitments provided to third parties and client cash withdrawals and reduction in customer short positions that fund long positions liquidity stress tests are produced and results are reported at different levels including major operating subsidiaries and major currencies to capture specific cash requirements and cash availability across the firm including a limited number of asset sales in a stressed environment the liquidity stress tests assume that subsidiaries will use their own liquidity first to fund their obligations before drawing liquidity from the parent company and that the parent company will support its subsidiaries and will not have access to subsidiaries liquidity reserves in addition to the assumptions underpinning the liquidity stress tests we take into consideration settlement risk related to intraday settlement and clearing of securities and financing activities at december and

the funding ihc would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity as applicable to our supported entities the combined implication of the spoe resolution strategy and the requirement to maintain

was published in the federal register in the fourth quarter of basel iii endgame proposal on july us banking agencies proposed revisions to riskbased capital and related standards applicable to us and our us bank subsidiaries basel iii endgame proposal the proposal would introduce a new measure of rwas known as expanded total rwas the expanded approach reflecting new rwa methodologies that generally align with changes to the global basel accord adopted by the basel committee the proposal would eliminate the current capital rules advanced approach and effectively replace it with the expanded approach which more heavily relies on standardized methodologies as compared with the standardized approach the expanded approach includes more granular risk weights for credit risk and introduces a new market risk framework in addition unlike the standardized approach the expanded approach includes operational risk and credit valuation adjustment rwa components the basel iii endgame proposal if adopted as a final rule would maintain the current capital rules dualrequirement structure whereby we and our us bank subsidiaries would be required to calculate our riskbased capital ratios under both the expanded approach and the standardized approach in addition the proposal would modify the standardized approach by requiring that the new market risk standards from the proposal also be applied in the standardized approach the basel iii endgame proposal would apply the scb and gsib surcharge to riskbased capital requirements calculated under both the expanded approach and the standardized approach the proposal includes a proposed effective date of july with threeyear transition arrangements until revised standards are fully phased in on july based on our current understanding of the basel iii endgame proposal we estimate that if the expanded approach had applied on a fully phasedin basis as of december and in the absence of taking any actions to mitigate its impact our expanded approach rwas as of that date would have been approximately higher than our actual standardized approach rwas as of that date the increase in rwas resulting from the expanded approach would result assuming all other surcharge elements remained unchanged in a lower scb and lower gsib method surcharge as compared with current surcharges as rwas are included in the denominators of the relevant calculations for each buffer lower surcharges would therefore partially decrease the otherwise higher regulatory capital requirements under the expanded approach the proposal would phase in the higher expanded approach rwas on july of each year during the transition thereby increasing our regulatory capital requirements with delayed incorporation of the potentially lower scb and gsib method capital surcharge calculations any estimate of how the expanded approach may impact us is a forwardlooking statement and subject to uncertainty as actual results may differ from the anticipated results and may be materially affected by and dependent on a range of factors including business performance future capital actions the results of future supervisory stress tests and potential modifications to the proposal by the us banking agencies in a final rulemaking the firm does not undertake to update any forwardlooking statement gsib surcharge proposal on
