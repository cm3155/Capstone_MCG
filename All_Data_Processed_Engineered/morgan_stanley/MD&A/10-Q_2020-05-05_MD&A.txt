have a significant impact on our financial statements march form 10q managements discussion and analysis the following accounting update is currently being evaluated to determine the potential impact of adoption reference rate reform this accounting update provides optional accounting relief to entities with contracts hedge accounting relationships or other transactions that reference libor or other interest rate benchmarks for which the referenced rate is expected to be discontinued or replaced this optional relief generally allows for contract modifications solely related to the replacement of the reference rate to be accounted for as a continuation of the existing contract instead of as an extinguishment of the contract and would therefore not trigger certain accounting impacts that would otherwise be required the relief also allows entities to change certain critical terms of existing hedge accounting relationships that are affected by reference rate reform and these changes would not require dedesignating the hedge accounting relationship the optional relief can be applied beginning january and ending december we plan to apply the accounting relief as relevant contract and hedge accounting relationship modifications are made during the course of the reference rate reform transition period critical accounting policies our financial statements are
