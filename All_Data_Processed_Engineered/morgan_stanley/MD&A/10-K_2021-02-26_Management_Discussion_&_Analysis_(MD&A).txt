assumptions see note to the financial statements we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note to the financial statements the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity fair value financial instruments measured at fair value a significant number of our financial instruments are carried at fair value we make estimates regarding the valuation of assets

certain securities purchased under agreements to resell certain deposits primarily certificates of deposit certain securities sold under agreements to repurchase table start december form 10k table end table start managements discussion and analysis table end certain other secured financings and certain borrowings fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in determining fair value we use various valuation approaches a hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when available the hierarchy is broken down into three levels wherein level represents quoted prices in active markets level represents valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable and level consists of valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs and therefore require the greatest use of judgment in periods of market disruption the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments which could cause an instrument to be recategorized from level to level or from level to level in addition a downturn in market conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of many instruments for further information on the definition of fair value level level level and related valuation techniques and quantitative information about and sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs used in level fair value measurements see notes and to the financial statements where appropriate valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk bidask adjustments credit quality model uncertainty concentration risk and funding in order to arrive at fair value for a further discussion of valuation adjustments that we apply see note to the financial statements goodwill and intangible assets goodwill we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of july and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist evaluating goodwill for impairment requires management to make significant judgments goodwill impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit level which is generally at the level of or one level below our business segments goodwill no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a reporting unit as such all the activities of a reporting unit whether acquired or organically developed are available to support the value of the goodwill for both the annual and interim tests we have the option to either i perform a quantitative impairment test or ii first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in which case the quantitative test would be performed when performing a quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the goodwill impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value limited by the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit the estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants would use for each of the reporting units the estimated fair value is generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology or methodologies that incorporate pricetobook and pricetoearnings multiples of certain comparable companies at each annual goodwill impairment testing date each of our reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value intangible assets amortizable intangible assets are initially recorded at cost or in the situation where acquired as part of a business combination at the fair value determined as part of the acquisition method of accounting subsequently they are carried in the balance sheets at amortized cost where amortization is recognized over their estimated useful lives when certain events or circumstances exist amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis an impairment exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss will be recognized if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows the initial valuation of an intangible asset as part of the acquisition method of accounting and the subsequent valuation of intangible assets as part of impairment assessments are subjective and based in part on inputs that are unobservable these inputs include but are not limited to forecasted cash flows revenue growth rates customer attrition rates and discount rates for both goodwill and intangible assets to the extent an impairment loss is recognized the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted for amortizable intangible assets the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset adverse market or economic events could result in impairment charges in future periods see notes and to the financial statements for additional information about goodwill and intangible assets table start december form 10k table end table

by us and accounting and operational matters certain of which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief accruals for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on a casebycase basis where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and we can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss we accrue the estimated loss by a charge to income in many proceedings and investigations however it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss in addition even where a loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously recognized loss contingency it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages restitution disgorgement or penalties numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of

laws of the us its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and the expense for indirect taxes and must also make estimates about when certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit we periodically evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each taxing jurisdiction resulting from current and subsequent years examinations and unrecognized tax benefits related to potential losses that may arise from tax audits are established in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance once established unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change our provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse our deferred tax balances may also include deferred assets related to tax attribute carryforwards such as net operating losses and tax credits that will be realized through reduction of future tax liabilities and in some cases are

assumptions regarding future taxable income and incorporate various tax planning strategies including strategies that may be available to tax attribute carryforwards before they expire once the deferred tax asset balances have been determined we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset balances to reflect the amount we estimate is more likely than not to be realized at

have access to adequate funding across a wide range of market conditions and time horizons the framework is designed to enable us to fulfill our financial obligations and support the execution of our business strategies the following principles guide our liquidity risk management framework sufficient liquidity resources should be maintained to cover maturing liabilities and other planned and contingent outflows maturity profile of assets and liabilities should be aligned with limited reliance on shortterm funding source counterparty currency region and term of funding should be diversified and table start december form 10k table end table start managements discussion and analysis table end liquidity stress tests should anticipate and account for periods of limited access to funding the core components of our liquidity risk management framework are the required liquidity framework liquidity stress tests and liquidity resources which support our target liquidity profile required liquidity framework our required liquidity framework establishes the amount of liquidity we must hold in both normal and stressed environments to ensure that our financial condition and overall soundness are not adversely affected by an inability or perceived inability to meet our financial obligations in a timely manner the required liquidity framework considers the most constraining liquidity requirement to satisfy all regulatory and internal limits at a consolidated and legal entity level liquidity stress tests we use liquidity stress tests to model external and intercompany liquidity flows across multiple scenarios and a range of time horizons these scenarios contain various combinations of idiosyncratic and systemic stress events of different severity and duration the methodology implementation production and analysis of our liquidity stress tests are important components of the required liquidity framework the assumptions used by us in our various liquidity stress test scenarios include but are not limited to the following no government support no access to equity and unsecured debt markets repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within the stress horizon higher haircuts for and significantly lower availability of secured funding additional collateral that would be required by trading counterparties certain exchanges and clearing organizations related to credit rating downgrades additional collateral that would be required due to collateral substitutions collateral disputes and uncalled collateral discretionary unsecured debt buybacks drawdowns on lending commitments provided to third parties and client cash withdrawals and reduction in customer short positions that fund long positions liquidity stress tests are produced and results are reported at different levels including major operating subsidiaries and major currencies to capture specific cash requirements and cash availability across the firm including a limited number of asset sales in a stressed environment the liquidity stress tests assume that subsidiaries will use their own liquidity first to fund their obligations before drawing liquidity from the parent company and that the parent company will support its subsidiaries and will not have access to subsidiaries liquidity reserves in addition to the assumptions underpinning the liquidity stress tests we take into consideration settlement risk related to intraday settlement and clearing of securities and financing activities at december and december we maintained sufficient liquidity

mix of durable secured and unsecured financing secured financing investors principally focus on the quality of the eligible collateral posted accordingly we actively manage our secured financings based on the quality of the assets being funded we have established longer tenor secured funding requirements for less liquid asset classes for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market

we must submit on at least an annual basis a capital plan to the federal reserve taking into account the results of separate annual stress tests designed by us and the federal reserve so that the federal reserve may assess our systems and processes that incorporate forwardlooking projections of revenues and losses to monitor and maintain our internal capital adequacy as banks with less than billion of total assets our us bank subsidiaries are not subject to companyrun stress test regulatory requirements the capital plan must include a description of all planned capital actions over a ninequarter planning horizon including any issuance or redemption of a debt or equity capital instrument any capital distribution ie payments of dividends or stock repurchases and any similar action that the federal reserve determines could impact our consolidated capital the capital plan must include a discussion of how we will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and how we will serve as a source of strength to our us bank subsidiaries under supervisory stress scenarios in addition the federal reserve has issued guidance setting out its heightened expectations for capital planning practices at certain large financial institutions including us in the federal reserve adopted a final rule to integrate its annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with existing applicable regulatory capital requirements the final rule which applies to certain bhcs including us introduced an scb and related changes to the capital planning and stress testing processes the final rule does not change regulatory capital requirements under the advanced approach the tier leverage ratio or the slr however failure to meet advanced approach or slr regulatory capital requirements inclusive of applicable capital buffers would also result in automatic capital distribution limitations the scb applies only with respect to standardized approach riskbased capital requirements and replaces the existing common equity tier capital conservation buffer of the scb is the greater of i the maximum decline in our common equity tier capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario over the supervisory stress test measurement period plus the sum of the four quarters of planned common stock dividends divided by the projected rwas from the quarter in which the firms projected common equity tier capital ratio reaches its minimum in the supervisory stress test and ii under the scb final rule the supervisory stress test now assumes that bhcs generally maintain a constant level of assets and rwas throughout the projection period in addition it no longer assumes that bhcs make all planned capital distributions although the scb incorporates the amount of four quarters of planned common stock dividends similarly the final rule eliminates the annual process in which the federal reserve provided its objection or nonobjection to a firms

and certain other subsidiaries in the event of a resolution scenario the parent company would be obligated to contribute all of its contributable assets to our material entities andor the funding ihc the funding ihc would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity as applicable to our material entities the combined implication of the spoe resolution strategy and the requirement to maintain
