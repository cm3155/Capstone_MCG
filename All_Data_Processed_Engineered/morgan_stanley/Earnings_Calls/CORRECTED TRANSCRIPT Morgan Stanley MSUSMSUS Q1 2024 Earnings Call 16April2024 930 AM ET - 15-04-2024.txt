and consistent strategy serving as trusted advisor to our clients helping them raise allocate and manage capital during the quarter higher asset prices and an improved economic backdrop supported confidence with our wealth management client base we saw greater activity both in the morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 advisorbased and selfdirected channels resulting in higher adjusted margins of netnew assets grew by billion investment management also generated positive longterm flows in the quarter across both wealth and investment management total client assets grew to trillion advancing toward our trillion goal as the new issue calendar returned for the first time in a number of quarters it was great to see us regain our leadership position in equity capital markets more broadly we saw building momentum in investment banking both in our ma and underwriting pipelines across corporate and financial sponsor clients technical difficulty both generated very solid results to round out a strong quarter in institutional securities as ever we remain focused on managing our resources sweating the income statement and being judicious with our capital our cet1 ratio was our excess capital position allows us to support our clients invest in our businesses and return capital to our shareholders particularly as regulators continue to evaluate basel iii end game additional regulatory clarity and a sustained capital markets recovery should have a multiplier effect across our global franchise further unlocking the unique power of our integrated firm i want to touch on the topic of client onboarding and monitoring in the wealth business with three short observations first this quarters wealth management results speak for themselves with record revenues and strong metrics across the board including strong margins and very strong netnew assets were really pleased with this terrific performance and we are going to keep on going second this is not a new matter weve been focused on our client onboarding and monitoring processes for a good while we have ongoing communications with our regulators as all the large banks do as james said in january we want to ensure we continue to be worldclass in every aspect of this growing business and third to be clear this is about processes we have been spending time effort and money for multiple years and it is ongoing weve been on it and the costs associated with this are largely in the expense run rate to conclude the first quarter of aligns with the goals outlined in the january strategy deck billion of revenue a efficiency ratio of earnings trillion of client assets and a return on tangible we have strong backlogs and momentum in every part of the firm while the pipelines are healthy there remains a backdrop of economic and geopolitical uncertainty our job is to generate these kinds of durable results on a consistent basis im very optimistic what lies ahead for morgan stanley and on behalf of our managing directors and employees same to those listening to the call we will deliver an integrated firm to clients and shareholders that is unmatched in both its integrity and its intensity now ill turn it over to our excellent cfo sharon yeshaya to discuss the quarter in more detail sharon yeshaya executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley thank you and good morning in the first quarter the firm produced revenues of billion our eps was and our rotce was our model is working as intended the first quarter results demonstrate the strength of our scaled business and an improving backdrop benefits of durable revenues particularly asset management fees in the wealth management business stronger capital markets and a continued focus on managing the full income statement all contributed to results the firms first quarter efficiency ratio was illustrating the inherent operating leverage in the model and our ongoing efforts to consolidate our expense base following multiple years of integrations efforts are evidenced by the yearoveryear reduction in professional services and marketing and business development spend morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 lower legal expenses further supported the improvement in efficiency ratio now to the businesses institutional securities revenues of billion were up versus the prior year reflecting strong performance across businesses first quarter revenues underscore the power of the integrated firm as our crossdivisional collaboration positioned us to capitalize on market opportunities the geographical breadth continues to distinguish our franchise and puts us at the center of client activity as the backdrop improves across regions investment banking revenues were billion for the first quarter up from the prior year a pickup in both equity and fixed income underwriting supported results offsetting the yearoveryear decline in advisory leading indicators continue to progress positively including the preliminary reemergence of sponsor activity advisory revenues of million reflected a decline in completed ma transactions equity underwriting revenues of million more than doubled versus the prior year as ipo markets reopened for most of the quarter alongside conducive markets for followons our global reach supported our ability to lead crossborder transactions and we regained our premier leadership position in equity underwriting league tables as global market volumes picked up fixed income underwriting increased yearoveryear to million results were driven by strengths in investment grade and noninvestment grade bond issuance as clients took advantage of tighter credit spreads looking ahead we expect the steady build of this business to continue we are encouraged by the health of the advisory and underwriting pipelines while the uncertainty of the rate path and geopolitical developments may impact the nearterm conversion of pipeline to realized conditions should improve over time and the underlying trends suggest that confidence is increasing we remain focused on expanding our reach through opportunistic hires particularly as we continue to see diverse pipeline and increased sponsor activity turning to equity we continue to be a global leader in this business revenues were strong increasing from the prior year to billion results were supported by performance in derivatives and cash and the franchise benefited from the scale of our prime brokerage business cash revenues increased yearoveryear reflecting broadbased strength in equity markets across the regions performance in japan was particularly strong supported by higher volumes our increased coverage augmented by our longstanding and unique partnership with mufg should be supportive over time derivative revenues were robust as the business navigated the market environment well and client activity was strong prime brokerage revenues were solid as client balances increased back towards alltime highs on higher market levels results reflect the mix of client balances and narrower spreads fixed income revenues were billion results declined slightly compared to the strong result last year recall last years results benefited from increased client engagement on the back of idiosyncratic events including those related to the us regional banks client demand for corporate solutions acted as a partial offset reflecting the strength of our integrated franchise macro and micro revenues declined modestly yearoveryear on lower volatility and client activity which resulted in less transactional flow results in commodities increased yearoveryear supported by higher revenues in the north america power and gas business morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 turning to wealth management the business delivered strong results across all key metrics demonstrating the continued power and differentiation of the engine we have built record revenues increased from the prior year to billion driven by record asset management fees from both a rising market and ongoing success in migrating clients to advisory relationships to better serve their needs transactional revenues excluding dcp were also strong as retail sentiment improved alongside institutional investors importantly net interest income remained in line sequentially pretax profit was billion and the pbt margin was together dcp and the fdic special assessment impacted the margin by approximately basis points the results highlight the inherent operating leverage embedded in the business particularly as revenues rise on the back of cumulative strong feebased flows as clients invest more in higher beta assets and transactional activity rebounds net new assets for the quarter were strong at billion with contributions from multiple channels including our family office offering over time our ability to deliver unique solutions to clients should continue to attract assets and lead to share capture feebased flows of billion were strong within feebased flows this quarter we saw particular strength from the migration of assets from the adviserled brokerage accounts to feebased accounts this demonstrates that over time assets migrate through the funnel into recurring revenuegenerating accounts feebased assets now stand at over trillion asset management revenues were billion up yearover year primarily reflecting higher market levels and the cumulative impact of strong feebased flows transactional revenues were billion and excluding the impact of dcp were up versus the prior year the first quarters results were driven by client engagement across products including record activity in structured products investments in our platform allow us to support increased client demand bank lending balances were billion up slightly quarteroverquarter reflecting modest growth in mortgages total deposits of billion were roughly flat quarteroverquarter as the decline in sweep balances was offset by continued demand for our savings offering while sweep balances were down on a spottospot basis average sweeps were roughly in line with last quarter broadly consistent with our modeled expectations net interest income was billion flat to the fourth quarters results consistent with our guidance the moderate increase in average deposit cost was offset by several factors including the reinvestments of assets at higher market rates looking ahead to the second quarter the deposit mix will continue to be the primary driver of nii assuming the current forward curve and that our assumptions around client behavior materialize we would expect nii in the second quarter to again be roughly in line with the first quarter our strategy is working we have a clear path to trillion in client assets across wealth management and investment management we remain focused on supporting clients on their path to advice deepening existing client relationships and using our scaled platform to achieve sustainable pretax profits over time investment management reported revenues of billion increasing versus the prior year results reflect higher asset management revenues which increased yearoveryear driven by growth in average aum on higher market levels total aum increased to trillion longterm net flows were strong at billion inflows were driven by strength in alternatives and solutions and reflect the benefits of our diversified product offering within alternatives and solutions demand for parametric customized portfolios was robust as retail clients including our own wealth management clients allocated investments to parametrics equitybased products underscoring the value of the integrated model flows were further supported by global interest in our active fixed income strategies liquidity morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 and overlay services had outflows of billion performancebased income and other revenues were million gains in us private equity and private credit offset lower accrued carried interest in asia private equity and real estate demonstrating the benefits of a global diversified platform we are seeing the benefits of ongoing investments in this business we remain focused on customization private credit and our global distribution parametric in particular has allowed us to deliver the integrated firm evidenced by the ongoing demand from our wealth management client base turning to the balance sheet total spot assets were trillion our standardized cet1 ratio was down basis points from the prior quarter standardized rwas increased quarteroverquarter as we actively supported our clients in more constructive markets we continue to deliver our commitment to return capital to our shareholders buying back billion of common stock during the quarter our tax rate was for the quarter the vast majority of sharebased award conversion takes place in the first quarter resulting in a lower tax rate we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately which similar to prior years will exhibit some quartertoquarter volatility the first quarter is clear evidence that as the backdrop improves our franchise is strategically positioned to capture upside as it was designed to do with client assets at a record of trillion across wealth and investment management we are on strong footing our wealth management business continues to focus on growth as well as supporting our clients with advice and delivering our differentiated offering and our institutional franchise is supported by our scale and our global footprint this combined with the build of the investment banking pipelines and market confidence provides us with momentum to deliver on our objectives over time with that we will now open the line up to questions question and answer section operator we are now ready to take in questions operator instructions well move to our first question from glenn schorr with evercore your line is now open please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thank you and i appreciate you not running away from a sensitive subject im going to push the envelope and just ask one followup if possible on the wealth matter i wonder if you could size the nonus wealth piece whether it be in client assets or revenue for us and correct me if im wrong if thats the focus and then more importantly do you think obviously you had a pretty darn good quarter so do you think this impacts any dayto day or your ability to grow and onboard clients in the future thats my real main question thank you sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley i think its a great question glenn happy to take that and just followup on exactly what ted said which is as you said the results really speak for themselves this is a phenomenal business we had record revenues and were in a great position we have strong margins strong netnew assets and no there are no strategic changes to our business there is no changes in our ability to do business and were extremely confident in our ability to grow and to deepen the relationship with the breadth of firm offerings that we have to serve our clients specific to your question on the international business it is small morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 operator well move to our next question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america your line is now open please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning maybe ted for you as we think about so it was a strong quarter for investment banking underwriting there seems to be a fragility to the macro outlook based on how rates have behaved on the back of inflation geopolitics just give us a sentiment check of when youre talking to your corporate clients like how resilient do you see the investment banking sort of trends and the sort of desire and appetite for corporates to engage in either dcm ecm or ma large ma activity as we look into sort of later in the year into the us elections thank you edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley thanks for your question the pipeline is clearly growing its growing across sectors its growing on a cross border basis there are some who will be willing to take the regulatory risk at this point in the cycle and there is activity that we will see both from the financial sponsor community and the corporate community well effectively be bidding with and against each other for assets this is a moment when most want to purify their business model or grow and that scaling needs to take place now that the effects of covid and supply chain are in front of us and geopolitics continue to be on our minds it is not surprising that the csuite wants to act so i think we are in the early innings of a multiyear ma cycle on the back of that we should continue to see all kinds of underwriting what was interesting about this ecm quarter where we had real success was that it was a combination of ipos from the valley capital raises from industrial companies regional trades crossborder unlocks it was the whole potpourri of offerings and weve also begun to see the beginning of event financing in the highyield and leveraged loan market so im feeling good about this being early to midcycle for the classic investment banking and capital markets business around the world and as you know we are very active in japan where we think activity will be heightened for years to come ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats good color and just one quick followup sharon on the wealth management nii and sweep deposits i think the sense is that were getting to a bit of a bottom on nii is that an accurate characterization and should we stop worrying about a big cliff event where nii declines meaningfully from where weve trended sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 hi i welcome the day where i stop getting questions on nii thank you ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc you can just say yes or anything else sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley i would characterize it as its now the third quarter in a row that ive said that our sweep models and the client behavior is following client expectations it does feel as though we are reaching that frictional level of cash of course well have to wait and see how things play out but broadly speaking it feels as though like i said we are in a place where you have what we would say is intraquarter volatility associated with things that might be t bills maturing people putting things in markets but that again is frictional levels of cash rather than large changes or movements in real client behavior which is what you saw two years ago in the summer when we saw the large move in rates which was a oneoff event and then you had again a very large event with the regional bank movements in the first quarter of last year so those are very specific events that we can look at and since then like i said we have been working with our modeled expectations operator well move to our next question from steven chubak with wolfe research your line is now open please go ahead edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning steve good morning steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc good morning ted good morning sharon so maybe just starting off on the expense outlook we saw some good progress on the expense front and the kpis are encouraging headcount was down yearonyear comp and noncomp surprised positively in isg and wealth and i was hoping you could just speak to your efforts to rationalize or optimize the expense base and with ib and wealth fees expected to ramp consistent with the ma commentary ted that you cited how should we be thinking about incremental margins as these businesses and particularly fees start to grow sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley certainly lets take just the expense big picture and we obviously disclosed the sec drivers of expenses i called them out weve had multiple years now where weve been looking to integrate multiple acquisitions and as weve come out of that weve been able to reevaluate our expense base and ive talked about it in different pieces of our earnings call many times ive mentioned space you can see even in the lines around occupancy in the actual disclosures you could see bumpups in space where youre taking writeoffs down in space and then it begins to trend down morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 again so were making bigpicture decisions around what do we actually need and where do we want to invest growth drivers as we move forward so consolidating the marketing dollars and figuring out what is the best use of those marketing dollars consolidating professional services how do we actually want to deploy fulltime hires in those growth objectives so in my prepared remarks we talked about two things we talked about taking expenses down in certain line items but we also discussed investments right i talked about the fact that were looking at opportunistic hires in ma weve discussed a lot about investing in parametric and technology weve been giving technological tools to our advisers and investing in the business so its a pushpull and its making sure as ted said that were sweating the income statement and were thinking about our resources efficiently and durably as we move forward through the cycle edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley what id add to that is if you just sort of had an intangible sense of what we talk about at our leadership meetings our operating committee of a dozen people and the next group the management committee of about three dozen and then their leadership teams i think its fair to say steve over the last five years a large chunk of time was spent talking about capital efficiency how we can optimize those toggles and of course with basel iii endgame pending and the annual ccar process ongoing we of course continue to dedicate time to that but the sea change over the last number of quarters and it has accelerated now into is were actively talking about the income statement about delivering earnings growth earnings momentum that obviously then ties into the returns on capital that we were able to generate this quarter but were looking to make investments strategic investments in top human capital now and then when it comes about but were being pretty judicious about that this is a great platform and we have a great team but we need to be running this thing superefficiently and that is why reiterating the efficiency ratio of in january was so important and that we put up this quarter where it was a generally constructive environment i think i called it a relatively constructive environment but theres clearly more operating leverage to be had when you get to the higher brackets of isg and then as you move to the funnel well so the focus on generating that operating leverage and keeping the income statement really tight is very much on the minds of the leadership team steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great color and just for my followup relating to the wealth management margins unpacking some of the different component pieces given continued strong fee momentum nice to see the inflection in nna too it sounds like nii is close to stabilizing just given some of the key drivers and inputs and the focus on efficiency just throwing all of that in the blender does suggest that this is probably a reasonable jumping off point and you can build off that base but i was hoping you could maybe provide some context around that sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley well what i would say is that we put out our goals in the last strategy deck and were obviously making progress towards those goals and when you think about what gets you to the framework that weve offered the morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 investment community is that there is sort of three parts to it the first is migration to advice and really the monetization of the funnel will go through this the second when you think about it is solutions and products that were offering and then the third is the benefits of scale and what was encouraging about this quarter is that all three of those things happened the first being the feebased flows that we saw at billion came from brokerage accounts they came from people taking money that was already in the channel that weve said will eventually be deployed and it is being deployed and thats what youre seeing here if you look back that particular transition that conversion is at a twoyear peak again encouraging color steve the second piece solutions products differentiated offering i called out structured products people have interest in products as ted said as markets begin to improve those could be new issuance that can be derivatives that can be solutions through structured notes thats what were seeing beginning to happen here so yes again an encouraging sign and the third is that we continue to gain the benefits of scale and operating leverage so all three things are working of course theres room to run but what were trying to do is make sure that we also have the right tradeoffs between investing in the business giving ourselves room for technology and being able to build a margin for a sustainable business and durable revenues over time operator well move to our next question from brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank good morning thank you for taking my questions edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank hey how are you ted edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank excellent id love to start with a question on nii and i know ive asked this in the past but we saw stability in the wealth management nii which sharon youve spoken at length about both on this call and in the past but we did see the firmwide nii dip again and it was the fourth quarter where the firmwide nii declined so could you explain how those diverged and maybe what caused some of that divergence morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley sure i think we talked about it before brennan but im happy to talk about it again and highlight that the reason that we point you to the wealth management nii is its a businessdriven nii when we look at the trading nii and we look at firm nii it really depends on the products you have where youre booking them what youre using as your funding source that falls into the various pieces of the trading revenue so we focus you in from our disclosures really on the wealth management nii when that nii is being driven by a business concept rather than just where you might be booking certain trading ph traits brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank okay got it is there something going on in institutional nii that would cause sort of steady declines and with those specific products that maybe might be a trend that we could explore a little bit sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley no i would really step you back and tell you that thats not how we manage the business and the trading revenue is going to fall where the trading revenue falls based on the products that we transact in in that quarter and the wealth management revenue ive given you the drivers with the deposits with interest rates with spreads and with reinvestment and theyre really two separate things that you should be looking at operator well move to our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi you had big yearoveryear growth in wealth management client assets up by about but the wealth management revenues increased by still decent growth but it seems like a little disconnect there so im wondering what kind of wealth management client assets youre growing sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley certainly so when youre growing the wealth management client assets its going to be all sorts of places like i said we begin to see assets they can come in actually in the brokerage side and over time they will migrate or can migrate based on the client preferences into the advice side those different assets are going to have different fees associated with them for us its about growing the funnel mike and then beginning to see this movement towards advice now id also point out that once youre in the adviceled channel even if youre in the feebased channel you might not directly be in the sp theres a composite there might be preferences to be in fixed income products there might be preferences to be in equity products but for us its about building sustainable durable revenue over time first you bring in the clients and the participants weve seen the participants grow then you bring in the assets weve seen the assets grow that then comes into the brokerage accounts which eventually moves into the morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 advicebased accounts and we continue to see great trends in the advicedriven model in feebased assets and the asset management revenues the asset management revenues mike are at a record high so i would just highlight that as well as proof point that this model is working mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then just one followup for ted ted i think your outlook for the industry capital markets was about as bullish as weve heard yet i think you used the word potpourri ipos in the valley crossborder by sector financial sponsor japan highest in years event financing specifically what are your backlogs how do they compare with last quarter and just one more time the level of your conviction that this time its for real because theres been a lot of small starts the last two years thanks edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley yeah i think its a reasonable question the backlogs are all up i think it will be a slow march back people are not going to jump into some of the speculative paper that we saw during the spac period clearly but the receptivity to recent ipos that were highquality was quite impressive quite broad interest among investors the need to execute on crossborder ma is here its for many companies an existential reality their supply chains have been disrupted by two major global conflicts and they need to nearshore and make the tradeoff which means they need to potentially bolton a piece of supply chain thats in front of them they may need to take regulatory risk there may need to be structuring and financing advice around that socalled solutions where we think were strong the other motivating piece mike is and i do think theres going to be growing consensus on this the financial sponsor community is sitting on a product that has a three four fiveyear life as a private company ready to come out one way or the other either through a public offering or to be sold in the private markets that is the best way for the financial sponsor community to return capital to their lps and keep the thing going with raising everbig funds so there will be a competitive dynamic i believe between the financial sponsor and corporate community with respect to assets that are available whether they are public or private in order to continue to create value for their lps or shareholders the fact that the us economy continues to grow that china is weaker that parts of europe are weaker highlights the fact that people indeed want to get even more exposure to the us with respect to japan whats interesting there is most of our client base are both buyers and sellers of assets which is to say theyre sitting on enormous yendenominated deposits but they wish to grow the economy so that is a market obviously where were active in the financial sponsor and corporate communities both in and out will continue to be so i am quite bullish about the full investment bank capability for those that have a global reach it could take several years and have some lumpiness along the way but i think the next three four five years will be quite active operator well move to our next question from dan fannon with jefferies please go ahead edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning dan daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 good morning hoping you can provide an update on overall client cash levels within wealth and how you think about the revenue opportunity as that cash is eventually redeployed sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley sure so we did see the percentage of client cash so weve given you i think in the advisory channel now down to say levels depending on what channel that youre looking at but that i would say is not a function of the actual cash levels coming down but rather than the equity markets have risen so just to be clear in terms of the actual mix the reason i bring up those percentages is theres still high relative to the precovid historical levels of say that weve given on previous calls so there is still room to see the deployment of cash over time into the markets daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc understood and as a followup in the release you mentioned about half of the flows came from your family office offering im not sure weve heard that stat before or so was hoping you could provide some context in terms of the size of that business for you and then also just the mix of flows more broadly in terms of the channels if you could provide a few more specifics in terms of the percentage breakdown sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley absolutely im so glad you asked as it relates to the family office offering because we have been talking about it for some time we launched and we really formally enhanced our family office offering in we discussed it on some of our earnings calls as a place where you could begin to see the integrated firm and by that i mean a way to offer our wealth management clients different solutions from institutional securities so our fund management products where were actually able to look at your portfolio from a more integrated basis the way that you would as an institutional client as we begin to offer new solutions to our clients theres more ways to get touch points with different and deepen different client relationships and bring them on board so this is an example of that the reason we point it out is also to highlight to you that there are lumpy flows that come through these channels and so when we say these flows can be lumpy there are different sales channels across the offering and those different channels have different sales cycles and so therefore you will see ins and outs of various pieces of nna over time but in this particular quarter and over the longterm history we have seen a very diversified set of channels we have the workplace we obviously have the advicebased relationship different pieces of stock plan et cetera that come in through the channel and there is diversification there edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley what id add to that is to sharons point on integrated firm we have this sharon made this reference to this gem of a business that we have in the institutional equities division called fund services which caters to alternative asset managers and effectively does their documentation work and effectively all of the release to their lps the question that has been asked over the last number of years is when some of these folks go on to open their family office and manage their own wealth what about having a product that has the feel of an institutional morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 product from when they were running their asset manager for their family office or for related business so the folks in fund services got together with the folks in wealth management who run our outsourced cio product and they effectively came up with a mousetrap that gives the look of an institutional product for folks who are very much in the ultrahigh net worth category and this helps work towards a piece of the wealth bracket that weve all been focused on over the last number of years which is the very high net worth space which is very competitive but in bringing together some of the capability and kit from the equities business over to the wealth business and have them work together with the founder in her next life managing a family office its actually a nice seamless way to keep the funds inhouse and to deliver institutionalstyle capability to clients so this is something we are putting our foot on the accelerator on and is a great example of our equities division and the wealth management folks are working handinglove to deliver something for clients operator well move to our next question from devin ryan with citizens jmp please go ahead edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning devin devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities great good morning ted good morning sharon a question just on trading obviously results have just been incredibly resilient and at a high level and i know you all have spoken about the market share opportunities for morgan stanley but then theres still this kind of expansion of the overall industry wallet and so love to maybe just hit on that second point and when you think about that wallet opportunity or the expansion of the wallet what are some of the biggest opportunities in kind of the growth algorithms i think a lot of us are sitting here saying results have been phenomenal how can they continue to improve from here thanks sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley sure ill take that when you think about the expansion of the wallet and consider where we came from and where we are now as more and more of the corporations and coverage of the corporations is becoming more integrated there are many solutions that a bank such as ourselves can offer be that from a global perspective if you think about where rates are as just a tangible example interest rate hedging that you can offer corporations as they think about transactions there are different types of foreign exchange transactions that you could think about when youre looking at ma or youre looking at other corporate deals that you have to do inhouse for a global franchise so there are corporate solutions that we expect to see growth in from a wallet perspective and theres also financing where you have different types of markets and channels that are growing private credit being an example where financing different assets by different types of sponsors are places where we could see opportunities for a wallet share growth more broadly edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley what i would add to that is were in the middle of the pe ecosystem with respect to ma financing risk if you ask a number of the asset managers both real money and alternative asset managers they would say we are a partner of choice so opportunity exists within credit where theres a big focus on the financing side morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 its obviously stable revenue and were getting after some of the opportunities that lie across fixed income and inside of our new issue business to originate structure finance credit of course a focus on private credit and then in equities to continue to expand our prime brokerage capability and to build out derivatives so this ecosystem around the financial sponsors who know our firm very well with all of the integrated firm capability this is a space and a client base that we are focused on along with of course our leading strategic clients on the corporate side devin ryan q analyst citizens jmp securities okay terrific color thanks and then a followup just on the debt capital markets outlook obviously a very strong quarter we have heard a little bit about maybe some pullforward just on the year in terms of people front loading and so just want to get a sense of whether you feel like that maybe played out as well for morgan stanley and then when you think about the pipeline for debt underwriting i appreciate that deals come together quickly so theres maybe not as much of a formal pipeline but is the tone there similarly strong is what youre seeing for ma and equity underwriting and also appreciate theres probably some interconnectivity there as well thank you sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah i would point you to as you said there is interconnectivity remember that i think many of the peers have also mentioned there could have been some pullforward that you saw its also been a market thats been open over the course of the last two years so i wouldnt draw the same parallel that you might have seen in ma or in equity where you had a real dearth of activity the last two years but rather that market especially in ig has been relatively open when you think about high yield and other nonig kinds of concepts and of course theres the eventrelated transactions but from an ig market that market has been wellopen over the last two years operator well move to our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is now open edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley good morning good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning ted thank you for taking the call ted you had some very encouraging comments on the outlook for the capital markets which is great a question for you you mentioned about the highyield and leveraged loan market youre starting to see event financing which is good how is the competition from the private credit side because they have made inroads obviously in the last couple of years are you guys seeing that the traditional investment banks are gaining some of that market share back edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley the competition is real and we all need to adapt to stay relevant in the ecosystem i think theres going to be room for folks in the private space to participate in deals but i certainly do not believe as some seem to suggest that morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024 the global investment banks will not have a large role to play as underwriters of securities and all the benefits that that brings to the issuer versus someone issuing private credit and potentially being the owner over time if things dont go well so i think were in a world where the ecosystem will at times have many of the players acting as partners sometimes well act as counterparties and at times even competitors but i think the ecosystem has more than enough room on a global basis for both the emerging private credit space but also the incumbents to continue to be able to do their thing gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and just as a quick followup to that once again your outlook is very encouraging years up again today theres talk of it moving even higher the front end of the curve is talking about higher for longer if we get into a really higher for longer rate environment does that kind of weigh on some of the optimism of the outlook that you presented today or no it doesnt really have a material impact on it thank you edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley well its a great question it depends on whether rates are higher because they are sustaining continued growth in the us or if they are higher for a period of time and are followed by a tough landing in which case were in recession and clearly then things will slow down i think our view is that the us economy continues to progress quite nicely that balance sheets amongst our client base are quite strong both on the institutional side and on the wealth side and that there is plenty to do and that the higher rates that we see are in part if not more than in part dictated by a view that we continue to have some inflation and that the economy is in healthy shape and maybe asynchronously relative to other places in the world but that again speaks to us strength and as you know first and foremost we have our activity based in the us but over time there will be strength in places again like japan and in europe and then eventually in the china complex where we will be busy too so my bullishness is not a marktomarket on any given week or month its a view that corporate board rooms have been quiet for three four years and that is not sustainable they need to move theyre ready to move before the pandemic then the pandemic came and then there were higher rates those higher rates seem to be well absorbed yes now we need to have models that factor in appropriate cost of capital as we saw in prior regimes where cost of capital matter and now were in a period that comes after financial repression where well have some inflation and some real rates and companies and financial sponsors will adapt and the strong companies will prosper so we are setting up for that and we believe will be a multiyear cycle and i would say finally that what were most excited about of course is the model that we are working with both the institutional community but also our wealth management clients to adapt and to optimize as we move into the next cycle operator there are no further questions at this time ladies and gentlemen this concludes todays conference call thank you everyone for participating you may now disconnect and have a great day morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2024
