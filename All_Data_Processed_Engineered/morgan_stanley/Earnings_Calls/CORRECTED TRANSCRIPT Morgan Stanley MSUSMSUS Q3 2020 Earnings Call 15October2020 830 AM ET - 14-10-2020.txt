thank you for joining us for a decade now weve been rebuilding morgan stanley from the depths of the crisis to a firm position to withstand whatever comes our way our performance this year has validated that approach and third quarter revenues were billion the second highest quarterly result in our history the balanced business mix continues to deliver consistent results and high returns we reported an rotce of with the yeartodate rotce of on october we closed the acquisition of etrade and last week we announced our intent to acquire eaton vance which serves as the latest strategic step in our transformation we added these acquisitions from position morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 of strength and we have a strong momentum across each of our businesses institutional securities has been pivotal to our performance in and again in yeartodate extremely strong this quarter isg reported over billion of revenues and billion of pretax strength in asia equity underwriting and fixed income sales and trading and our overall equities business powered our performance asia had its best quarter in nearly a decade as we continue to see the benefits of the investments we have made in that region fixed income delivered the highest third quarter revenues in years excluding dva isg revenues todate are billion up over last year and we continue to believe our institutional securities business has meaningful organic growth opportunities wealth management continues to grow both organically and inorganically on a yeartodate basis feebased flows have been an exceptional billion with billion in this quarter alone lending balance growth was a quarterly record of billion versus the prior year lending balances have increased nearly while we did not own etrade in the third quarter it is important to note how they performed delivering strong client activity and asset growth in the quarter as they have all year with etrade our total client assets are now trillion that is up from billion approximately we oversaw before we bought smith barney a decade ago representing an increase of nearly times our investment management business serves as the third leg of the stool and produced over billion of revenues on its own this quarter assets under management reached a record billion important to note that that is compared to billion of assets under management we had less than two years ago assets under management growth has been powered by longterm net flows with over billion in the third quarter fueling of course fee revenue growth while generating this strong organic growth our recent announcement allowed us to transform our investment management business giving it scale and several incremental growth engines at one time frankly it was too good of an opportunity to pass up for years we have viewed eaton vance as the perfect partner we will bring together two highperforming asset managers with great business momentum and through this partnership we will now manage trillion in assets under management and generate a combined billion in annual revenues and to cement october as one of the most important months in our history we received an upgrade to a2 from moodys the only gsib to receive an upgrade during the pandemic their recognition of the firms clear and consistent strategy to shift our business mix towards lower risk recurring profitable revenue streams in wealth and asset management together with our integrated investment bank is a further codification of our transformation so what do the next to months hold one we will make material progress on the integration of etrade two we will close and commence the integration of eaton vance three we will reinstitute our capital distribution plan in assuming of course we have clarity from the federal reserve it is worth noting that our cet1 ratio following the additions of etrade and eaton vance is expected to be basis points above our scb requirement of four we will focus on driving organic business growth while managing expenses and five we will ensure our culture remains firmly clientcentric and grounded in doing the right thing this includes operational resiliency meeting all regulatory expectations and maintaining the risk profile we enjoy today i will now turn the call over to jon to discuss the results of the quarter and together we will take your questions thank you morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 jonathan m pruzan chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley thank you and good morning in the third quarter firm net revenues were billion with net income applicable to morgan stanley of billion we reported an rotce of our yeartodate revenues reached a post crisis record institutional securities is having an exceptional year capturing the elevated client activity and managing risk well wealth management is delivering stability while the underlying indicators continue to position us for future growth and investment management is delivering growth through industryleading longterm net flows our bankers and financial advisors are supporting our clients as they remain intensely engaged expense management remains a priority on a yeartodate basis our firm efficiency ratio was down approximately basis points from the prior year we remain focused on our more controllable sources of spend while continuing to support our growth initiatives employees and communities noncompensation expenses increased on higher volumerelated expenses and higher unfunded credit provisions which were partially offset by a meaningful decrease in marketing and business development expenses compensation expenses increased on higher revenues now turning to the businesses institutional securities had the strongest third quarter in a decade equity underwriting corporate credit and strength in asia underpinned the results clients remained engaged through the third quarter as risk assets continued to rally through august and capital markets remained active from a regional perspective asia had a stronger quarter in nearly a decade with contributions from each of the businesses heightened activity and interest in china which saw a particular strength in ipos and equities drove results yeartodate asia revenues are higher than all of investment banking generated revenues of billion decreasing from the prior quarter while fixed income underwriting subsided and advisory revenues remained muted equity underwriting buoyed results with particular strength in ipos advisory revenues were million reflective of lower completed ma industry volumes equity underwriting continues to be extremely active with revenues of million results were driven by ipos which nearly doubled versus the prior quarter offsetting declines in convertibles and blocks fixed income underwriting revenues were million results were impacted by the lower levels of event related activity in the quarter the equity underwriting pipeline remains healthy we expect issuers to continue to access the market and remain opportunistic the advisory pipeline is recovering as evidenced by the recent increase in announced activity and we have seen the pickup in both sponsor and corporate activity equity sales and trading revenues were billion we are number one in this business both for the quarter and yeartodate results were particularly strong in asia as well as the americas consistent with client interest in higher growth regions and momentum names respectively while volumes declined from historic levels of the second quarter activity remained robust both cash and derivatives revenues were elevated for a third quarter prime brokerage results were strong average balances increased as market levels rose and certain clients re levered with spot balances closing above periodend levels fixed income sales and trading had the strongest third quarter in a decade excluding the impact of dva driven by the strength in micro revenues were billion in aggregate with most products declining from an exceptionally strong second quarter activity levels were healthy as clients remained engaged throughout the summer months from a geographical perspective results were broadbased and yeartodate fixed income has now generated over billion of revenues morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 micro continued its robust performance bidask spreads remained elevated though lower than the prior quarter benefiting results performance was supported by continued strength in securitized products and credit corporates macro was impacted by lower sequential revenues in rates and foreign exchange as spreads normalized and volatility declined foreign exchange and rate markets continue to be rangebound commodities results reflected lower activity but were supported by strength in metals highlighting the diversification of the business in recent years our isg loan portfolio continued to perform well as a reminder over of our isg loans and commitments are either investment grade or secured the sequential decline in results across other sales and trading and other revenues primarily reflected lower gains net of hedges on our heldforsale portfolio due to less spread tightening compared to the prior quarter our funded isg loans declined by billion from the prior quarter driven primarily by paydowns in our corporate loan book our funded ratio of corporate loans now stands at down from in the prior quarter and well below the peak at over we added to our reserves modestly in this quarter our provision for loan losses was million down from the second quarter we had approximately million of net charge offs primarily from one commercial real estate loan that was troubled precovid our allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments increased to billion of which our allowance on loans now stands at million the increase were primarily driven by covidrelated sectors covidrelated sectors continue to represent just of our total isg lending exposures and the substantial majority of these exposures are either investment grade or secured by collateral our allowance for corporate loans increased to and for cre remained stable at across the entire heldforinvestment loan portfolio our total allowance rose to turning to wealth third quarter revenues were billion broadly in line with the prior quarter and up approximately excluding the impact of dcp pretax profit was billion our reported margin was mergerrelated expenses and a regulatory charge impacted the margin by almost basis points the underlying indicators of this business remain robust including record net new assets continued strength in client engagement feebased flows loan originations and net recruiting feebased flows were exceptionally strong at billion in the third quarter contributing to a yeartodate fee based flows of billion total client assets ended the quarter at trillion higher than the prior year in the third quarter transactional revenues were million including the impact of dcp revenues increased sequentially exhibiting seasonal strength driven by capital markets activity asset management revenues increased sequentially to billion reflecting higher starting asset levels on higher markets and feebased flows importantly asset management fees are billion yeartodate a increase over lending growth remained strong with balances exceeding billion on a yeartodate basis balances have grown by billion with record quarterly growth of billion in the third quarter growth was broadbased across the portfolio we saw strength in securities based lending which was driven by strong engagement from ultra high net worth clients and by adding resources to our lending businesses the loan portfolio continues to perform exceptionally well we had only million in net chargeoffs in the last seven quarters in this portfolio forbearance continued to decline mortgage forbearance fell by more than half representing less than of our portfolio and 90plusday delinquencies declined to basis points forbearance on commercial real estate loans in our tailored lending book declined by approximately net interest income was million declining sequentially higher lending and bdp balances helped to partially offset the impact of prepayment amortization and tighter deposit spreads morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 prepay was more meaningful in the quarter accelerating in the latter part of september as rates declined nearly half of the sequential decline in nii was attributed to prepayment amortization total us bank deposits were billion and third quarter bdp balances were up billion despite delayed tax payments total expenses were billion in line with the prior quarter investment management results were very strong as the business continues to demonstrate meaningful momentum longterm net flows and strong investment performance has supported aum growth which is translating into higher fee revenue revenues of billion represented the second highest quarterly level in over a decade increasing from a robust prior quarter total aum rose to a record high billion representing over billion of growth since last year longterm net flows were billion driven by continued strong investment performance in global equity strategies being global remains critical our investment team in asia began subadvising a newly established esg global equity fund in the third quarter it was one of the most notable fundraises in japan in the last years and at quarterend had more than billion in assets under management inflows across all regions led to an annualized longterm growth rate over for the second consecutive quarter total net flows were billion as liquidity inflows moderated and investors pivoted away from money funds asset management fees of million increased sequentially driven by higher management fees consistent with strong growth in aum in the third quarter we did see an increase in fee waivers on certain money market funds as a result of the rate environment and we expect to see the full effect of this trend in the fourth quarter investment revenues were million in the quarter we saw broadbased gains across the portfolio with sequential increase primarily driven by gains in asia private equity funds total expenses were million the increase was driven by higher compensation on higher revenues as well as higher bce expenses on higher average aum we are very excited about the future of this business and to be partnering with eaton vance we expect to close the transaction in the second quarter of we look forward to advancing our partnership with eaton vance and further enhancing our investment management platform turning to the balance sheet total spot assets declined to billion as funding levels declined from the highs of the second quarter our standardized rwas declined by billion to billion and our standardized cet1 ratio rose basis points to compared to our scb of our board declared a dividend per share excluding million of intermittent net discrete tax benefit our tax rate was we continue to expect our fullyear core tax rate will be approximately to on october we closed the acquisition of etrade as a function of the closing we issued million shares and billion of common equity our assets increased by approximately billion and rwas by billion we created approximately billion of goodwill and intangibles of which billion will be amortized over approximately years and our cet1 ratio increased by approximately basis points tangible book value per share declined by approximately and our book value per share was essentially flat as you would expect in the fourth quarter we will start to see mergerrelated expenses as we begin the integration of etrade we will start to break these charges out in our disclosures in january when we report yearend results as for the operating outlook the dispersion of potential macro outcomes remains high and while we are cognizant of the seasonal patterns of the fourth quarter we are encouraged by client engagement across all three businesses in the first few weeks of the quarter morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 with that we will now open the line to questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from glenn schorr with evercore your line is now open glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much curious if we could talk about flows in wealth management you mentioned a couple of things but im curious what you would attribute yeartodate to recruiting versus consolidation of wallet share and while were on it if you could talk about the wealth management loans being up almost is that a combination of mortgage and sbls just curious whats driving that within wealth management jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley sure in terms of the flows listen this is a longterm secular trend that we continue to see that people want to pay for a managed account and one fee and weve seen this for the last several years and we now approach about of the assets we manage are in feebased accounts its really a combination of multiple factors and i think you mentioned many of them one weve seen more cash come into the network and that cash is being deployed although theres still significant amount of cash on the sidelines within our network but we have seen more come in and more of thats being put into the market number two your comment about net recruiting were seeing morgan stanley become the destination of choice for financial advisors recruiting has been quite strong and we brought in bigger teams over the last course of the last nine months and with them they are bringing their assets which are being deployed into the feebased accounts so really a combination of those two things and then lastly weve seen attrition drop significantly so were not losing many assets so a combination of all those three things and again we think thats a longterm secular trend that will continue and well continue to see good flows into our feebased accounts and then i think the lending growth is really as you mentioned those two products the sbl product we saw a significant pickup about billion this quarter predominantly about to of that came from our ultrahigh net worth client base weve continued to invest in the platform i think weve gotten better at using data and analytics weve added some more support to the field and weve seen real receptivity around that product with our client base and then lastly mortgage continues to do quite well interestingly we had about purchase this quarter which was nice to see as that has picked up as well so its really both those products have been quite strong within the footprint james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah i would just add glenn sort of observing it now from a little distance because im not directly involved in it this is the healthiest i have seen this business in the years ive been here in terms of client flows both fee based flows and absolute flows which we historically dont break out there were a lot of movements during the year with tax payments and the like but its extremely healthy and the attrition number is very low as jon said morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 so net recruiting better client penetration and a lot of very wealthy clients validating the model and you add that to the etrade franchise which has also seen very strong flows this year its for me its very exciting to see it glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi i appreciate that maybe just one followup on the expense side first maybe with the core expense you mentioned activity levels are up so obviously expenses are elevated but marketing and te has been down maybe if you could start with how to think about that for the goforward on expenses and then i know that we have to wait till january for your integration thoughts on etrade dollarwise but maybe you could talk a little bit about what you actually have to spend money on on the integration and etrade so we can just start putting together our thoughts on models thanks jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley sure just broadly on the expense base what weve obviously seen given the elevated volumes is elevated brokerage and clearing expense that goes with the trading volumes as well as transaction taxes as i mentioned asia has been very strong so weve got a little bit more of a skew towards transaction taxes and those will continue to remain elevated assuming that the volumes remain elevated and those generally ebb and flow or they do ebb and flow with the volumes weve done a really nice job of also managing our professional expenses we continue to try to drive those numbers down and then the market and business development expenses has really been driven by just the lack of travel the lack of conferences things being converted to virtual and we would expect that to remain muted for a while but ultimately those expenses will start to tick up as we start to see movement around the globe in terms of etrade as you know in february when we announced the transaction we talked about million of integrationrelated charges that we would incur over a threeyear period as i just mentioned that will start in the first this current quarter in the fourth quarter well start to break out those disclosures so you can see exactly what they are we closed the deal about days ago were extremely confident about both the funding and cost synergies that we laid out and we also think theres significant revenue opportunities as we get into the integration here so youll start to see that this quarter well break it out and as you said well give you some more thoughts around that in january operator thank you our next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research your line is now open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley good morning jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley good morning morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so james i wanted to start off with a question on capital the accretion has been considerable as you noted since the pandemic started and youre clearly significantly overcapitalized you also noted that you plan on returning the excess possibly as early as next year subject to regulatory approval and removal of the buyback moratorium how should we be thinking about the pace and cadence of buyback and your comfort initiating payouts in excess of of earnings and just separately how does the dividend target evolve alongside that james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley few questions tucked in there steve very artful steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thank you james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley youre welcome listen were overcapitalized i mean thats the bottom line we were overcapitalized before we went through ccar last time and our scb numbers actually were lowered by the fed reflecting the change in the business model its something that we thought we felt for a long time and its starting to be recognized and even if you look at the ppnr models where we continue to argue i think entirely appropriately that financial advisor compensation is a variable not fixed expense so it would come down as revenues come down our ppnr numbers would actually be healthier than theyre currently showing eventually i think that argument will prevail i hope it will prevail but even without that with the accretion from the etrade transaction were making billion a quarter net and were paying out total dividend i think about billion looking at jon maybe slightly higher so were clearly accreting a lot of excess capital about probably billion net without doing buyback on a base where were basis points above the minimum requirement well always keep a buffer i dont know what that buffer should be basis points probably something like that im looking at our cfo here to see if he disagrees with me hes sort of shaking his head sideways like hes probably a little plus on the basis points im probably a little minus on the oh hes a little minus okay were all happy lets see on buybacks there is absolutely no reason given morgan stanleys current condition the shape of our balance sheet our liquidity profile and the mix of the businesses why we wouldnt be distributing capital except that for right now its the right thing to do for the broader community as we work through this pandemic exercise and the fed does its pandemic stress test which is going on right now im highly confident we will come out of that showing we have significant excess capital im hopeful well have those results before we get into next year but obviously thats not within my purview given that i would expect us to be back doing buybacks in the first quarter obviously if the economy completely tanks between now and then or if the results are less positive than i expect them to be then all bets are off but thats youve got to run the business as you see it likely to be and thats my likely scenario how much do we do yeah you could do by definition you could do above payout otherwise well never eat into the basis points at some point we have to do something with this capital our shareholders rightfully who own the company are entitled to generate a decent return on the capital invested in the company morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 we have to do something with it buying eaton vance was a tremendous opportunity to use some of that its going to hit our cet1 i think about basis points but weve accreted to basis points in the meantime so were sort of back to where we started but we own a new company thats a nice thing so you can tell im a little animated on the subject if you look at any of the global gsifis in the us i think its fair to say we are carrying the most capital surplus and i dont think theres any rational reason why once we get through the covid stress test if you will that that will perpetuate unless we get a result which is adverse which i dont expect steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for all of that perspective james and maybe just a question for jon on the nii outlook you beat on virtually every line item i think nii was the lone exception you were not alone this quarter as prepays started to accelerate even towards the end of the quarter but just curious given the strength in loan growth that was cited in glenns earlier question i want to get a sense as to how we should be thinking about the nii trajectory from here whether we should expect things to start to stabilize and maybe even grow as we look out to jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley yeah well i think youre right we did get hit with prepayments at the end of the quarter i think absent that prepayment level we generally came in where we thought and where we had guided you to probably a little light as we saw some contraction in deposit spreads i think on a goforward basis if we were just ourselves i would say were pretty stable at this point we obviously have reinvestment risk as the investment portfolio turns over but were generally offsetting that with the growth were seeing in the portfolio but as you know we did close etrade etrade comes with a large lowcost deposit base and a very highly liquid highquality investment portfolio so from a quantum perspective next quarter youll or this quarter youll see the dollars of nii go up as about half of the revenues generated at etrade were from nii and then were going to start optimizing their portfolio as we laid out in february well give you a better sense of sort of what the sensitivities are around that but were highly confident we can get the funding synergies that we outlined in february and that contribution of nii probably ticks up but still is going to be sort of again relative to others about only of the wealth business which again is a much smaller part of the overall company james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley steve just back to your capital question its important to note that lets assume just mathematically i dont know were carrying excess capital right now 300plus basis points on requirement if thats the case and were still generating roes of rotce of so with that excess capital were generating these kinds of returns so i think shareholders could sensibly look through that and project what the returns would be on the capital were actually using to run the business and obviously theyre higher than where we are now steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc great thanks for that perspective james thanks for taking my questions james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 sure operator thank you our next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs your line is now open brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking the questions wanted to start with one on expenses so at the beginning of the year james you provided some targets twoyear targets that focused on efficiency ratio and pretax margin in wealth but i seem to recall that they were based on this was before all the deals so i think they were based on what ill refer to as legacy ms not pejoratively but just for clarity so im not trying to be nitpicky here i just want to try and understand is there a way were going to be able to track your progress in your legacy business towards those targets or is the idea that now that youve got so many of these like strategic integrations that are continuing your transformation that thats sort of trumping the work that you had previously laid out on efficiency and therefore its just more important to focus on the integration there and not the efficiency push just want to try and understand how to think about that james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley sure brennan i think there are sort of three elements to looking at this one is what is the as you described it the legacy business going to generate in terms of efficiency ratio and right now i think this year were slightly over we were less than that in  we were higher in  and were right i think right on the button this quarter our twoyear objective was to so meeting that our longterm aspiration was under and we are very close to meeting that so check the box on legacy number two is what do the new acquisitions do to our efficiency ratio if you look at the pretax margin on the etrade business its lets see its sort of in the 40ishpercent range maybe a little below that with whats going on with net interest income and if you look at the eaton vance business its closer to so by definition if you simply added one plus one your efficiency ratio would actually be lower but the third bucket of course is what are the integration costs while they dont start on eaton vance until we close that which jon said should be  of next year actually we had a small number of integration costs already in etrade as you know in the last little bit and that will build and i think we put out a projection of million over three years i personally would like to accelerate that we will probably identify it as a belowtheline number so just for cleanliness and for your models well show youll be able to see efficiency ratio with and without it but clearly well talk to our accountants about the right way to report that but were not going to hide the ball here we are highly confident that absent integration costs our efficiency numbers theres no reason why they dont stand brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay great thanks for that and then i know that jon i think you mentioned that your plan is to lay out some more specifics around etrade with the fourth quarter call which makes a lot of sense but whats your early read on how youre thinking about some of these changes that are likely to happen on the back of this integration is the plan that the etrade bank sub will be folded into one of the morgan stanley bank subs are you planning to integrate the bds morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 and really one of the great assets that etrade brings the stock plan business has sort of a different focus more of a public plan focus and so the strengths are very different but offer a nice kind of yin and yang with solium which has a strong private offering so how do you plan to bring those platforms together or is the idea that in order to fully capture the broad strength keeping them separate is a better approach and so it may be the full integration is not going to be realized in order to maintain those various strengths jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley sure and broadly the answer brennan to that question is yes but i think the way were thinking about it first weve got to integrate the systems we want to capture the cost and the funding synergies that we laid out we want to do it in a way that doesnt disrupt the customer experience and ultimately enhances the customer experience and then as you said i think we believe there are significant opportunities across all three channels to generate growth and revenue growth and whether thats in the stock plan business and trying to get our cash capture numbers up to the etrade numbers when we did the deal they were running about theyre now running north of our numbers were dramatically lower than that so if we can bring the combined business together and get that to a higher level closer to theirs thats a significant synergy clearly they are generating lots of new clients some of those clients are ultimately going to want advice and so there are lots of opportunities across all three channels and well start to see those as we get these systems integrated as we mentioned before that well keep the etrade brand for the selfdirected business line but were going to bring these companies together slowly this was not a deal about cost it was about revenue opportunities ultimately just like the eaton vance deal was and were going to take our time integrate them well and bring the cultures and companies together james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley and to be clear nothing has changed in our view of etrade if anything its got better the integration plans weve been working on for six months with mike pizzi ceo of etrade whos joined our operating committee very wellthoughtthrough plans great detail well stage the various businesses as you highlighted the workplace the banks et cetera and then the actual etrade trading business will retain a separate identity because it has a very powerful brand in the marketplace so we are highly confident were going to get the cost synergies its just and i think we gave you that million number in january or february i guess when we did the deal and it would be fair to say thats probably not we tend to be conservative with numbers like that so i doubt were going to be spending more than that and the pace of the spend will be just run with the integration plan so its going exactly as we hoped it would go but even a little better frankly operator thank you our next question comes from mike carrier with bank of america your line is now open michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning and thanks for taking the questions first just institutional had a very strong year and few years for that matter and james you mentioned upfront you still see some good organic growth opportunities just given your leading share in some of the areas can you provide maybe a little color on just where you see some of the attractive organic growth in that business and if that can maybe offset some of the expected ph moderation in it morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah well firstly doing deals in the institutional space is a little ph fraught youre unlikely to want to do balance sheettype deals i dont think anybody would be sending up balloons if we did that and there are obviously advisory businesses around the world that you could acquire smaller ones boutiques if you like but we havent found anything that really excites us yet so if we look at the organic growth just look at fixed income and still the gap between what our fixed income business is doing which is phenomenal by the way from where theyve come from its truly phenomenal and credit sam kelliesmith and ted pick overseeing all institutional business for that turnaround in the last couple of years just phenomenal but they clearly have capacity to grow in that business our equities business we lost the number one mantle for a quarter we didnt like that we got it back clearly prime brokerage has continued to consolidate theres growth across prime brokerage our capital markets business in asia particularly chinabound asia enormous we have an incredible franchise there i think there are parts of banking we could be stronger in we have some segments where were very dominant healthcare tech and then some other industry groups we could get even stronger so i think in dcm weve made progress i think were number five or six in dcm underwriting jon and well four actually hes pointing to me i think the gap there with some of our competitors theres no particularly rational reason why there should be a gap there i think theres just its nowhere near were nowhere near what we could be as a potential the question is can we get there with the kinds of returns we want and expect from the business so were quite judicious were not just throwing balance sheet at it look at the trading var i think our trading var this quarter was million a day and that was materially lower than our major competitors so we are quite judicious about it but a series of small steps rather than big swings is the way id describe the institutional business and theyve delivered as i i made a point of saying in they had a record and again in theyre delivering so i think theres a lot of upside and obviously its also framed by the competitive landscape and what the european banks are doing or not doing et cetera jon i dont know if you want to add to that jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley yeah no i think youve summed that up well and i think asia is really a bright spot for us as i said yeartodate the revenue generation from that business in isg now bigger than europe we see that as a real growth engine and well continue to make investments there michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch all right thanks a lot and then just given the recent ma whether its etrade in wealth or eaton vance in investment management i think both make sense just curious on timing is it obviously you had the excess capital or were you seeing something from like an industry dynamic and then more importantly both of those businesses are putting up good growth so just what do you think that business does with these transactions obviously not over in the next to months but maybe two to four years james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah you were a little garbled there with the phone line but i think the question was around the timing of those transactions heres how i think about acquisitions there are at least four things that matter one is strategy two is culture three is price and four is timing strategy is like the high table if you will the holy grail youve got to morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 have strategic intent its got to be a logical fit its got to be building on something which you already have competence in its not a swing for the fences its not new ground its something we know well were good at and thats the perfect strategic opportunity comes when you get that and we got that with etrade and then with eaton vance culture is very important particularly in the finance industry where a lot of deals have gone bad because of cultural bad cultural fits including by the way in the asset management space and theres a fairly high skepticism probably from all of you about large asset management deals we thought through that a lot eaton vance has been around years were the biggest distributor of their product we know them extremely well parametric has been an absolute home run in our system the calvert funds and what theyve done in sustainability space the fixed income combined with our fixed income business their core equity funds theres so much to like about it and about their leadership team and i would point out that they had an internal voting shareholder structure and all of their internal voting shareholders voted in favor of the deal unanimous so it wasnt just the board it was the management so culture i feel really good about price is price you dont buy quality assets cheaply timing is the thing least in your control and i am sure if we didnt do this transaction with eaton vance somebody else might have we didnt want to do it before we had the etrade thing completely done on the other hand we wanted to get moving quality assets dont sit on the shelf for very long they were interested in morgan stanley we were interested in them so timing is just timing is the thing youve got to give most on it may not be the ultimate convenience it certainly came hot on the tail of etrade we didnt want to communicate all of a sudden were trying to do an acquisition a week were not we didnt control the timing so we if we got the first three right then timing is the least important what it does in the covid thing i think is your broader timing issue with whats going on with the economy listen their business is growing theyve had great growth as i said the parametric product has done incredibly well since it was created a few years ago theyre seeing great growth across the whole platform as is our asset management business so we really think were putting together two strong growing businesses and the investment market is not going to go away whatever happens in the election whatever happens politically so im not worried about that over the next couple of years michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch great thanks operator thank you our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo securities your line is now open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi well to coincide with your upgrade of your credit ratings congratulations my question is on risk indiscernible james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i thought you were about to upgrade us mike when you said upgrade you have disappointed me man morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc well first quarteroverquarter loan growth is well above the industry so just wondered about the risk related to that and how youre getting what others are not second on the etrade acquisition the spread revenues for etrade seem like theyd be quite a bit lower so updates on revenue thoughts with that acquisition and then third with eaton vance billion for a firm thats earning about million youd have to double the earnings just to get over a roe so in terms of risk loan risk etrade risk with the spread revenues and eaton vance risk with just really getting your full moneys worth james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well ill let jon talk about the credit risk but i would observe that we are not in the unsecured credit world we do not do small business lending on any scale at all we tend to loan against peoples own portfolio so we have collateral and we have total visibility on the consumer side and on the institutional side were very careful about what sectors weve been in were not overexposed to some of the more troubled sectors and we have a lot of really good clients who have been really loyal to us have great businesses that we want to support during this period so the fact our credit is performing differently from some other institutions is completely irrelevant it entirely depends on who youre lending to and on what terms and conditions so on the etrade business yes with the nii obviously that business is affected by that on the other hand the account openings the positive asset flows the opportunity for us to provide those kinds of mortgage and lending products to their clients the opportunity for us to provide the alts platform on their system the fact that were not spending million a year building out our own digital platform there are so many positives before you even get to the workplace business where their conversion rate as jon said is something like 20plus percent and ours has been about so i just think that we certainly our eye is wide open on whats going on in interest rates in this world i dont expect that to be a permanent state but its certainly not something that makes me shy about the attractiveness of this acquisition the underlying benefit and flows in the business have been phenomenal and the one thing that is actually changing peoples behavior even more than whats gone on in the last five years is the increased use of digitalization whether its their health services financial services obviously shopping et cetera so i think we couldnt have been more blessed than to have got etrade at the time we got it on eaton vance listen mike im not that smart one of your colleagues on the call said that even if we paid billion excess for it at billion company its like yeah its im not ashamed to say its fully priced but this is a quality asset and i look at the growth rate in the asset i dont look at the static position we will get the expenses out of this we will consolidate this we will generate the revenues from it it fills out our fixed income asset management business in a way that we couldnt have done otherwise and it provides us some real growth ph endurance as i said with their core equities platform with parametric with calvert funds the atlanta fund theyve got so many businesses that work for us they have very little international distribution we can take them internationally we have trouble getting our product distributed domestically because we dont have a strong wholesaling sales force as others do they do they have a worldclass one so will that deal deliver im positive that deal is going to deliver and if we overpaid by a couple of hundred million dollars people said we overpaid solium by a couple of hundred million dollars some people said we overpaid smith barney by a couple billion dollars so i take a very longterm view on acquisitions morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc just one more followup to pull back the lens even more over the last to years youre right now reversing some of the actions that you took you sold off van kampen and now you go ahead and get an asset manager you got out of kind of the mass market wealth management now youre back with etrade can you give us kind of your big picture strategic thoughts on why the longterm reversal here james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i totally disagree with what you just said weve not had a longterm reversal we sold van kampen which i regard as a mistake i said it a couple of years later i wish we hadnt done it but we did it and i said on a call a couple weeks ago if marty flanagan was listening i regret that but god bless him hes a friend of mine and i wish him well we havent got out of the mass market and by the way etrade is a combination of a workplace business an active trader options derivative business and a direct business we have always provided financial services since we merged with dean witter in to the average investor we happen to have a lot of very very wealthy investors in addition but we have millions of people with hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest not tens of millions of dollars to invest so this is not a change in strategy at all this is about getting scale in the businesses we want to be in the one thing we did differently which i would have done differently ive said repeatedly is van kampen but you look at some of the other stuff we did we got out of mortgage servicing saxon we got out of shipping storage and oil storage and shipping transmontaigne and heidmar we got out of the indiscernible pdt business peter mullers business because it was a prop business so we shut down frontpoint our hedge fund we got out of discover which was a credit card business to the mass market unsecured credit we have fundamentally and that happened before my tenure obviously but fundamentally changed the profile of this company to focus on originating distributing and managing capital for individuals governments and institutions thats what we do and this is entirely consistent with that and eaton vance sits squarely in that square operator thank you our next question comes from jim mitchell with seaport global your line is now open james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc thanks good morning maybe just to follow up on etrade if we look at their results in the first half as you pointed out james theyre very strong james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 adding retail accounts up cash balance is up i guess two parts to the question i guess first on the flip side you have lower rates so how do you think about the accretion targets given the growth weve seen versus the interest rate declines weve seen since you announced the deal and then secondly how do you whats driving i mean obviously the markets have been volatile but do you think that kind of account growth can continue and is that a big surprise going forward james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well let me start and then im sure jon will add listen were on day or something here and i know everybody wants to fill out your models im sympathetic to that sharon has already told me thats what everybody is looking for and id love to be able to do that for you but were not going to do that today they have had unbelievable growth i think their record new account number before this year was and theyre over in the first quarter second quarter couple of hundred this quarter well over it theyve had incredible asset flows into the business so will that continue i think itll stay elevated it wont continue at this level there will certainly be net attrition because some of these accounts that were opened will close they were smaller accounts but they also brought in a lot of large accounts so i think the answer is jim it will slow but theyve reached i believe theyve reached a new baseline above where they were previously because of all the engagement around the markets how their pl then plays out based on that and based on some of the mortgage and alt product and other stuff that we put in their system and some of the expenses that were able to take out and the funding benefits jon can address that but well certainly do a full update at yearend once we have an actual quarter of them sitting inside morgan stanley jon jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley yeah i think stay tuned for january but we announced this deal in february we told you it would be dilutive in year one breakevenish in year two and accretive in year three and we still think that thats the general framework and well give you more information in january we just started on this path we still have high confidence in the funding synergies the million of cost savings and the broad outline that we outlined in february james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc all right thanks appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from devin ryan with jmp securities your line is now open devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay great good morning thanks for taking the question first one is just around the acquisitions and i appreciate that you guys have your hands full and the message is nothing big coming soon or at least it sounds like but if we take a step back youve added many millions of new retail customers to morgan stanleys ecosystem over a short period of time whether that be through solium etrade or eaton vance and so if we think about products are there any big products or services that youre not touching yet at the firm level that could morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 really make sense to plug into this broader retail consumer base or is it really now just more about crossselling existing morgan stanley james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i think weve got a very full plate right now and i think the biggest opportunity is probably putting mortgage product to high fico score clients with good assets at etrade and putting the banking product through the morgan stanley system the digital banking to go with our already the two banks that we have i think they are the two obvious ones devin but im not seeing a specific product gap and as always we have total open architecture well take anybodys best product including from all our competitors because if thats whats right for the client then thats the right thing to do so im not seeing a product gap devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay terrific and then just a quick followup i just want to make sure im following whats happening on the wealth side on the advisor head count so this was the first quarter of net additions in over a year this is the best addition quarter in five years and i heard the comment that morgan stanley is a destination and also benefiting from lower attrition but is this quarter kind of a oneoff in that evolution or is this something that we should maybe focus on as a shift occurring and maybe the backlog could back that up so maybe just curious kind of what the recruiting backlog looks like and if we should start to think about head count growth again on the financial advisor side james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley jon may have a comment but its hard to project but the trend is definitely our friend and if you look at the net recruiting numbers for the last several quarters i dont have them on hand but i think the gap has been closing weve now turned positive were at an interesting inflection point with that business its got great momentum thats all ill say and the attrition part of it devin is if people arent leaving then by definition youre going to be growing but jon i think youve been closer to the jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley yeah i think thats right and the pipeline for recruiting certainly in the nearterm is strong were attracting attractive teams with good business books of business as james said the number of advisors if you go back ph the jv was dramatically higher or the attrition rates are quite low and on a net basis were seeing sort of flat to slightly growing numbers but more importantly the assets and the revenues that the new advisors are bringing with them is going to be additive in future years so its a really nice position to be in right now devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay okay terrific thank you operator thank you our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets your line is now open morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning james good morning jon james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley hey gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc jon you touched on the prime brokerage results were strong in the quarter average balances i think you said increased as the markets improved and more clients became relevered up or engage more can you share with us whats going on with winning new clients particularly in other geographies outside of north america is that also driving these numbers jonathan m pruzan a chief financial officer executive vice president morgan stanley so a couple of things we did have a nice quarter in pb youre right balances are up from where they were theyre still below the peak levels we have seen the longshort hedge funds relever quants still havent re levered as much as the volatility and the equity markets still remains reasonably high we continue to see a nice pipeline of new launches that adds to the growth dynamic adds to the growth dynamic and its been pretty broadbased so we continue to believe if the markets remain constructive if volatility comes down well continue to see growth in the pb balances which will drive revenue growth in the future gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup i think james you talked about the strength in the institutional business youve been very pleased with the numbers in and yeartodate you cited some of the competitors overseas arent as strong is there any evidence yet that they are kind of getting back up on their feet ph and so be a more competitive environment as we look forward or do you think theyre still struggling james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well i dont think i said that gerard to be fair i just said there might be opportunity depending what some of the international competitors strategies do and clearly some of them have chosen over the last few years to shrink their balance sheets and go back to their core traditional banking businesses more its hard for me to predict these things wax and wane a little bit so i dont want to comment on their strategy except to observe whats happened and thats clearly provided opportunity for some of the us banks but that could change gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley sure morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 15oct2020 operator thank you our next question comes from andrew lim with socgén your line is now open andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk hi morning thanks for taking my questions so a question for you james on ma strategy please so you talked a few weeks ago about your disappointment at ms being trading like a bank with pe ratio of to times and i can see how buying wealth management and asset management businesses like try and change investors perception of that but id like to sort of like discuss it from a different angle why isnt it a better strategy to divest cib its not obvious to me that cib has synergies with asset management and wealth management you can have the cib trading at to times and then asset and wealth management trading at times on top of that you can have the bulk of the excess capital with asset and wealth management and that could be returned freely to shareholders with that restriction from the fed so i was just wondering what your thoughts are on that as a strategy to maximize shareholder value james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley thats not going to happen thats my thought about that we have an integrated model for a reason we have the ballast from wealth and asset management we have the engine room we generate originate product in our institutional business that helps provide enormous opportunities for our clients across the other side of the house there are so many synergies andrew thats just not thats not even remotely close to
