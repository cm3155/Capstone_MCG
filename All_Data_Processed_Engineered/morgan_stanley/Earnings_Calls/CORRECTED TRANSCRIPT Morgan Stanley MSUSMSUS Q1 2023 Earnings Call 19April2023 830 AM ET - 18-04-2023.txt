good morning everyone and thank you for joining us the first quarter of was very eventful for our industry but not so eventful for morgan stanley firm delivered strong results with revenues of over billion net income of billion rotce of and net new asset flows of billion at the same time we bought back billion of stock while maintaining a cet ratio of morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 in many ways it was an excellent test of morgan stanley and the opportunity to show the strength and stability of our business model let me just touch briefly on the turmoil in the banking sector in my view we are not in a banking crisis but we have had and may still have a crisis amongst some banks i believe strong regulatory intervention on both sides of the atlantic led to the cauterization of the damage i consider the current issues as not remotely comparable to i was pleased that morgan stanley along with the other large us banks became part of the solution by providing an uninsured deposit line of billion to first republic bank someone who lived through the darkest days of where morgan stanley was seen as part of the problem its indeed rewarding to be here years later as part of the solution turning back to our own company while the performance of the overall business was strong the results reflected the impact of the environment in wealth management positive flows of billion were a very strong result reflect continued growth in the model together with the flight to quality this obviously gives us a good start to our trillion every three years target wealth management also benefited from diversification as longterm outflows moderated and we saw strength in parametric and also in the liquidity product overall margin of the wealth management business was impacted by modest increases in credit reserves slightly lower growth of nii versus forecast and ongoing integration expenses we continue to focus on the levers within our control with an eye towards expense management in isg underwriting and ma remained very subdued as ive said previously these are revenues delayed not dead already were seeing a growing ma pipeline and some springlike signs of new issuance emerging that said it largely remains a back half and full year story on the positive side our fixed income and equity trading teams performed very well in managing through some historic trade moves total trading revenues were solid i expect the markets to remain choppy through this earnings season and for the next several months however absent any geopolitical surprise or limited progress in bringing down inflation i think is likely to end on a constructive note in most areas morgan stanley is very well positioned not just for but for several years ahead as we see significant growth opportunities across all three of our client platforms ill now pass it over to sharon for more details on the first quarter sharon yeshaya executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley thank you and good morning the firm produced revenues of billion in the first quarter our eps was and our rotce was the firms results demonstrated the durability of our business model evidenced by the resilient rotce robust asset consolidation and wealth and our stable capital and liquidity levels in institutional securities fixed income and equities supported our clients while navigating volatile markets wealth management showcased billion of net new assets and investment management continued to benefit from the investments we have made to diversify our offerings the firms first quarter efficiency ratio was deferred cashbased compensation plans negatively impacted our firms efficiency ratio by approximately basis points ongoing technology and marketing and business development investments as well as higher litigation costs increased operational expenses versus the prior year given the broader market uncertainty and the inflationary environment expense management remains a priority although we continue to prioritize investments in our longterm goals morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 now to the businesses institutional securities revenues were billion an decline from the very strong prior year fixed income and equity results partially offset weakness in banking as we helped our clients intermediate markets through this period of heightened uncertainty from a regional perspective asia delivered its third highest quarter ever with strength in areas of both fixed income and equity aided by the policy dynamics in japan and the china reopening investment banking revenues decreased yearoveryear to billion solid revenue in advisory supported results while ongoing market volatility continue to pressure equity and noninvestment grade underwritings advisory revenues were million benefiting from the completion of previously announced transactions revenues were down versus the strong prior year on the back of lower announced volumes in equity underwriting revenues were million down largely as a result of depressed ipo activity while ipo and followon activity remained muted issuers selectively accessed market windows fixed income underwriting revenues were million results were supported by an open investment grade market and opportunistic loan activity clients are engaged as we help them navigate an uncertain backdrop and our investment banking backlog is building financial sponsors continue to look for opportunities to invest within underwriting we are encouraged by the issuance activity during constructive windows of course further conversion from pipeline to realize is predicated on clarity around macroeconomic conditions stable financing markets and increased corporate confidence equity revenues were billion a solid quarter against an uncertain and volatile backdrop we continue to be a leader in this business and the results reflect our global and diversified footprint cash revenues decreased versus the prior first quarter on lower global volumes derivative results were solid compared to a strong quarter last year as we helped clients navigate challenging markets prime brokerage revenues were down as equity market levels declined clients remained engaged and balances increased steadily throughout the quarter fixed income revenues of billion were strong though lower versus the prior years elevated result which was impacted by the beginning of the fed rate hiking cycle and the start of the war in ukraine this quarters performance was driven by rates and credit macro revenues were down modestly yearoveryear with relative strength in rates versus foreign exchange in the comparison period the volatility created by varying expectations around global central bank policy aided results across regions micro results were up versus the prior year supported by client engagement commodity revenues moderated meaningfully compared to the robust results in the previous first quarter largely due to reduced volatility in european markets and the mild weather in the us other revenues of million improved versus the prior year largely driven by higher revenues on corporate lending activity and gains related to dcp turning to isg lending and provisions our allowance for credit losses on isg loans and lending commitments increased to billion in the quarter isg provisions were million and net chargeoffs were million the increase in provisions was driven by the higher recessionary probability and worsening outlook for commercial real estate the chargeoffs were substantially all from a handful of specific loans morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 turning to wealth management revenues were billion movements in dcp positively impacted revenues by approximately million compared to a negative impact of nearly million in last years first quarter net new asset growth of billion was a standout as we continue to execute on our longterm strategy pretax profit was billion and the pbt margin was the margin reflects the more favorable revenue mix offset by higher credit provisions and an increase in expenses as we continue to invest in our business inclusive of integrationrelated expenses credit provisions were million including those that impacted revenue and the integrationrelated expenses for the quarter were million in line with our expectations forward growth drivers remain robust net new assets were very strong at billion for the quarter representing a annualized growth rate of beginning period assets while nna will be lumpy and should be looked at on a full year basis the results illustrate our ability to attract assets and the payoff of our investments to support growth we saw contribution from all channels with notable strength in the advisorled channel particularly amongst existing clients the events in march and the rising interest rate environment over the past year impacted client behavior clients increased their allocation to cash equivalents such as money market funds and us treasuries by over versus last year at the same time deposits declined in the quarter by to billion we believe investable assets stayed within morgan stanley as our clients worked with advisors to help navigate the volatile markets today advisorled assets invested in cash and cash equivalents stand at a peak of compared to historical average of approximately over time we believe clients will reinvest these balances across more assets when the market outlook improves in the interim given our broad product offerings clients are choosing to invest in cash with morgan stanley through the cycle positioning us to provide them with more reinvestment choices down the road net interest income was billion up yearoveryear results reflect the impact of higher interest rates and lower sweep balances feebased flows of billion were strong asset management revenues were billion down versus last year reflecting lower market levels transactional revenues were million excluding the impact of dcp revenues were down versus last year due to fewer new issuance opportunities and reduced activity levels compared to the beginning of lending balances declined this quarter to billion led by pay downs in securitiesbased lending reflecting the higher interest rate environment importantly our strategy is working and we are seeing channel migration from workplace to advisorled advisorled flows originating from workplace relationships reached billion in this quarter alone doubled versus this time last year and this compares to the approximate billion we saw annually over the past three years furthermore almost of these flows were from assets held away also consistent with what we have seen historically our strategy remains in place to best serve our clients and support the firms path to reach trillion in client assets moving to investment management revenues of billion declined yearoveryear primarily on lower aums due to the decline of asset values and cumulative effect of outflows over the prior year total aum ended at trillion longterm net outflows were billion as equity outflows moderated in the quarter in fixed income outflows in floating rate loans were partially offset by high yield and emerging markets finally morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 alternatives and solutions delivered strength driven mostly by demand for parametric fixed income customized portfolios as well as inflows into private credit liquidity and overlay services had inflows of billion positive liquidity inflows of billion were partially offset by outflows related to a single client relationships asset management and related fees decreased versus the prior year to billion due to lower average aum partially offset by higher liquidity fee revenue performancebased income and other revenues were million results were supported by gains in our private alternatives portfolio reflecting the diversity of the platform integrationrelated expenses were million in the quarter in line with expectations a key focus area remains maximizing our global distribution capabilities and we continue to see momentum internationally particularly from the eaton vance fixed income teams our investments across a broad array of strategies and capabilities including active etfs parametric customization and alternatives position us well to benefit from the diversification as well as to serve our global client base turning to the balance sheet spot assets were trillion largely in line with the prior quarter our standardized cet1 ratio stands at and slr at standardized rwas increased quarteroverquarter primarily on client activity consistent with seasonal patterns we continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders including buying back billion of common stock our tax rate was for the quarter the vast majority of sharebased award conversion takes place in the first quarter creating a tax benefit we continue to expect our full year tax rate to be approximately which will exhibit some quartertoquarter volatility as james discussed the fallout resulting from the events in march is nonindicative of the systemic stress that the industry faced during the global financial crisis our clear and consistent strategy allowed us to enter this environment well positioned the outlook for the remainder of this year is difficult to predict we are keenly aware that opening and functioning markets and economic stability are integral in aiding confidence moving forward in the interim we remain focused on supporting our clients and attracting assets to our platform with that we will now open up the line to questions morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well take your first question from daniel fannon from jefferies daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning just thinking about the environment and the opportunity can you talk about advisor recruitment i assume retention is high but as you think about the opportunity given some of the fallout with some of the regional banks in the current environment maybe talk about how youre positioned and maybe how that differentiates versus say a year ago sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley certainly the advisor recruiting pipeline remains healthy we continue to see assets aggregated from all channels as i mentioned both recruiting advisorled and workplace and when we compare it to a year ago i think that what we continue to see is that we remain a destination of choice not only for new advisors but also obviously as we stated from the assets held away that we continue to aggregate in both net new assets from existing and from new clients daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc and then just as a followup with nii generally probably a little more challenged versus where we were last year how do you think about wealth management margin expansion in this environment and maybe specifically can you talk through the nii trends as you think about this year and how we should think about that given some of the deposit dynamics you mentioned as well as the current rate environment sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley so first lets take nii as we said what weve been looking at is weve been thinking about it in terms of modeled client behavior obviously march itself had a different modeled client behavior than we probably would have expected for other months within the quarter but when we look ahead were currently not expecting expansion of the quarterly nii as we go forward now as that relates to the margin a margin obviously is still impacted by certain things such as integration related expenses we mentioned also litigation and we continue to really invest in the model as we go as we have and also as we go forward all of that being said our eyes are still on the goal that we had set forth and we will continue to achieve as we move through time to progress to those goals operator well hear next from glenn schorr from evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hello thanks maybe we could follow up on that conversation im just curious you mentioned that interesting stat of sitting in cash and cash equivalents up from historically if we weave that into normalizing over morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 time but also deposits were down and cost of funds is up a bunch as we go through the year do you anticipate the normalization of the cash component at the same time deposits continue to come down and migration continues to be yield seeking like i guess my question with all that ramble is is can the margin get back into that range while we have these cash seeking and yield seeking behaviors happening sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley so i think that for us to predict exactly what the behavior will be obviously if we think about what happened in march thats a very difficult thing to predict but i think what youre highlighting in your question glenn as i parse out the very beginning of it is right now cash and cash equivalents are at a higher level a higher level than weve ever seen historically as we begin to see those assets be deployed into different types of products that ability and that advice will obviously be accretive it will also help us as we see asset levels rise so there is a pullpush factor as you think about those things in addition to that as we continue to aggregate assets we will gain from scale the more assets that we see the more we will see in balances the more that will probably help as you think about just what the cash balances are more broadly because assets are being attracted to the platform and in addition to that we will gain for the longer objectives of what that might mean for the margin and for the wealth management business more broadly glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc okay james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley if i could just add and excuse my voice i have a chest cold glenn on the simple math to take the margin of that business from to is about million obviously were still absorbing some integration stuff relating to the platform that will be done this year we had slightly higher reserves weve been investing pretty aggressively in the business and frankly i think prudent appropriately the payoff is billion which is a net new asset organic growth of so ill take that any day long the assets ph sustain the building so yeah we have a lot of levers to push that margin around a couple of percent points thats not frankly a source of great anxiety to me at this point and i think youll see us probably push a few of those levers as we get through this year and certainly next year so the tradeoff is i think we all want to keep investing for growth we see a real window here this trillion target is for real the trillion every three years is whatever it is million a year million i guess and starting off with million i think we have pretty good visibility to net new money so its a balance but as we get through this integration as its finally completed some of those costs roll off well get a little tighter in the expense management in the wealth business i know andy and his team are already focused on that so and then the deposit stuff will is kind of going to be what its going to be depending where rates go and what the fed does glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 appreciate that and thank you for fixing my question the followup i have is simpler on commercial real estate can you just help us just dimensionalize the portfolio what exposure do you have and how do we get comfortable that this isnt a gift that keeps on giving like im sure theres details within the provision that you took that could help us thanks sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley absolutely i think whats important about that portfolio is that it is diversified in addition to that we have been reducing the exposure in the isg direct cre portfolio over the course of the last year or so so obviously we keep our eyes on it as you know cecl is a lifeofloan concept and so as you see economic deterioration you do need to account for that and the same goes for what were seeing in the commercial real estate market so i think that those are the two main points i would point you to is that it is diversified and we have been continuing to reduce that direct exposure operator well hear next from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i guess just first question i wanted to follow up on james a comment you made about expecting to end on a constructive note i was wondering if you can elaborate on that just in terms of a lot of this is tied to macro how do you think the economy playing out in terms of the feds fight against inflation damage it does to the economy and the markets and as you think about ending where do you think well be on all these fronts by the time the year ends james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well our house call out for the markets to end about flat from where they started at the beginning of the year and i certainly support that i think the two wildcards out there are geopolitical risk which we cant really handicap my gut is that the uschina relations while having their moments of tension remain overall stable through this year and global trade remains stable the second risk of course is that the feds actions doesnt bring down inflation while the evidence so far is it is bringing down inflation but theyre probably not done i think its likely well see at least one more and possibly two more rate increases that gets you to sort of high type interest rates which is not shocking and if we get through that again many people are calling for a modest recession it might be i dont know obviously but my gut is whether its a modest recession or we dodge that bullet sort of doesnt matter that much what really would matter is if inflation is not tamed fed has to go much higher than people are expecting you go into a much deeper recession thats certainly not a likely outcome at this point so thats why i said i think i used the words constructive for morgan stanley if the sort of green shoots were starting to see again i dont think theyre a  type event but back half of the year and next year in banking and underwriting we just had a global risk committee yesterday discussed some of this stuff and certainly underwriting calendar it looks like its picking up a little bit through the back half of the year i think the wealth management what sharon pointed to the in cashlike securities moving into active investments that will happen i mean through the long history of this business people dont hold a quarter of their morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 money in cash that just is not real so and i suspect once were past this sort of inflation fed action there will be a long pause would be my gut followed by some rate cuts starting in i do not expect that this year so when i put it all together relative to sort of other periods that ive been through my career i think it feels given the land war given geopolitical stuff given the inflation surge given covid it actually feels surprisingly benign from what it could have been now thats not denying there are clear stresses the commercial real estate that i think glenn just asked about across the banking sector whats going on in some of those banks with very idiosyncratic portfolios that frankly didnt match duration and interest rate risk well is were issues there are parts of the world that are still having slower growth so its not a perfect it kind of reminds me of the rolling stones song you cant always get what you want but you get what you need and i think about morgan stanley coming out of this and were kind of getting what we need were getting a cet1 were getting a rotce decent revenue decent earnings obviously opportunity to take some costs out and i think very well positioned on a goforward basis so thats where the word constructive came from ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley sorry for the long answer for one word ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc no no i appreciate that color and just as a followup when we think about capital return in terms of one the pace of buybacks given the macro uncertainty any perspective there and just opportunistically do you see this as creating opportunities inorganically mawise for morgan stanley as we look forward james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley weve maintained its a very good question ill deal with sort of what the capital position is now and what the opportunities are for excess capitals on the capital position now our cet1 is running at we obviously have control over that dial to a large extent so and we have tilted conservative i think its fair to say i havent seen all the numbers but im pretty sure were at the top of or above all of our competitive set again and weve been that way for quite a while so on current capital requirements with the last stress test were at i think or somewhere around there so is a very healthy buffer but weve got a new stress test coming out so many people feel that its going to be a little tougher than what it was last year it might be and weve obviously got plenty of capital for it so i dont expect any issues whatsoever and then we have basel iii coming out in i think sort of late may june type period where and again that will be implemented probably it looks like earliest so again theres time for the banks to adjust their capital positions morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 so we will have much better visibility as to what were dealing with by say july and again i suspect it might drive some changes in how we run our balance sheet but i dont think its going to involve anything particularly draconian now given that we like to maintain a healthy buffer we have done obviously the deals we did in the last couple of years etrade and eaton vance which i just said i couldnt be more happy with both the timing of those deals the pricing of those deals and the performance of the businesses and when we see a really robust market environment youll see that even more so in spades weve had a very healthy dividend yield i think its over sharon something like that now we believe in the dividend ive said for years that i think of the wealth management business as a dividend stock and were clearly making more money in that business than were paying out in dividend and were buying back i mean we dialed the buyback down a little bit i think to billion we were probably running at billion at that peak last year on a quarterly basis and we did that just it was an interesting environment i mean lets just say you had two of the biggest banks fail in the last years so being a little prudent a little conservative watching that going on you dont want to be too grabby is my attitude so i think we have lots of flexibility there is no doubt we can and over the years will do more acquisitions in my mind there is no doubt about that whatsoever and it will be in the wealth and asset management space and we constantly keep a list of who is attractive and who would be a good fit but obviously i couldnt say if there was something imminent but theres nothing imminent but its something we focus on so again im sorry im giving long answers this morning it must be this cold ive got operator well move next to steven chubak from wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley hi steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so i wanted to start off just unpacking the nna flows that you saw in the quarter i mean is really an impressive result the feebased flows continue to lag brokerage and just wanted to better understand what you see as a sustainable feebased flow rate and just as we try to evaluate the durability of the how much of the quarterly inflows were from frc where youre clearly a destination of choice for some of those trading advisors sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley im going to try to remember all of your questions steve in order so if i forget one just remind me the first point on frc ill take first in terms of the regionals more broadly as i mentioned in the prepared remarks i believe we morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 had about billion that came in without any relationship to those regionals and so that showcases to you thats well above the average that weve seen so i think it just continues to show that the investments that we have made are really working as we move forward so thats sort of point number one the second point that i mentioned and i think you asked where are those assets coming from its really in this particular quarter was in that advisorled space both from existing accounts and new clients to me what was most remarkable when i was going through the diligence materials really was what were seeing from existing clients so the idea they that we continue to be a destination of choice for our existing clients and attracting assets held away again speak to all of the conversations that weve all had over the course of the last seven years or so talking about investments to give our advisors more time to service their clients as we move forward then the final question that you asked around the feebased flows actually a very strong feebased flow number to be honest from our perspective in an environment where individuals we think about it cash and cash equivalents are high youre thinking about putting your money into managed kind of accounts associated from that feebased concept youre unlikely to do that in a period of time where you think that cash and cash equivalents and safety might be what youre looking for right now and so that is in fact the dry powder that we have that over time could move into the feebased assets so i think its actually a strong number given the environment that we have on the backdrop steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no really helpful color sharon and just for my followup on sweep deposits those are now running below of aum thats historically been a strong support level for transactional cash within the advisory space broadly was hoping you can give some perspective on how we could think about where sweep cash could potentially bottom and have you seen any continued mix shift into sweep or deposit pressures in april so far sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley as it relates to april i talked a little bit in one of the earlier questions about modeled client behavior and that what we did see is that in march we really deviated from some of that modeled client behavior now in april we have been more in line with modeled client behavior so that does speak to your point of maybe we are in a position where from a transactional cash level were there but again as james said it is an uncertain environment and so from that perspective well have to wait and see how we move through time from here operator moving next to brennan hawken from ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions id actually love to follow up on that last question from steven so april is more modeled april is typically a tax payment month which is a headwind so are you seeing where is that cash getting funded from are you seeing some of the taxes tax payments coming out of both sweep and the other higher cost deposit sources is it more biased to the higher cost could that provide some relief and when we put all that into the mix and think about nii going forward should we be thinking about stable nii we know its not growing but is funding cost elevation maybe could lead to some downside so curious how we should be thinking about that morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley i think that your question in terms of april in terms of where its coming from the exact breakdown is challenging to see in terms of exactly where its coming from from all of the deposits perspective because as you know cash is fungible so you could take something and move it into a different security or a different asset so to parse that out is challenging i do think that whats more important as you highlight is that it is tax season and so to not see an acceleration is obviously one of the more optimistic signs that you are moving through more modeled client behavior now what it means from funding we obviously have many funding different places i dont think that funding is a concern as you mentioned it does matter from an nii perspective but it will be a function of two things brennan as you know rate expectations have also changed since january and so our nii forecast and predictions are based on modeled client behavior in terms of cash sweeps et cetera and also where interest rates are and where the forward curve is for fed funds and so as you begin to see if that changes that could change your nii forecast we are still if you look at modeled client behavior asset sensitive and so from that perspective i think that gives you a few different pieces to put together in terms of how to think about the forward look based on different assumptions brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks very much obviously a lot of uncertainty so appreciate that color and then one more on the net new asset component sure you guys have an offer for promotional offer and its tied to higher yielding cash alternatives what percentage of the net new assets came in to from that promotion this quarter and in the past youve spoken about when you bring that cash in a majority of it stays in the system do you have any more granular statistics on what portion of that stays in the system its obviously good that it comes into the system but kind of curious when we think about stickiness and how much is hot money and how much is actually durable thanks sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley so the best way think about the stickiness within the system is actually nna right because youre going to see the outflows would be a net negative to the nna more broadly and so the consistent growth over time if you look at it all the way back even to when we saw promotional levels back i remember we spoke about this in and i think it was and in those early years that was still seeing net new asset inflows over time so for me the most important thing is well whats the net the net continues to be positive and continues to ramp higher in terms of the cd exact offerings and what that would mean from nna its considered nna if its brought out from outside of the firm and again whats important here is that we continue to see more in the advisorled space and that over time again think about the channel migration from workplace into the advisorled space whats important here is that when people begin to see money into advisorled we actually see more money from assets held away so i know that doesnt answer your question directly but i think its important to highlight as people begin to work with an advisor what we said to you is of the assets that then come are from assets held away morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 outside the building so just again another proof point that once they understand what the advisor has to offer it helps aggregate new assets into our system operator well hear next from gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning sharon can you share with us when you guys talked about and i think james said around of your wealth management customers assets are in cash or cash equivalents which is high of course at what interest rate do you guys sense meaning do rates have to fall basis points or basis points for that money to move back into more traditional assets sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley so i dont actually know its the absolute value of the rate level and i will answer it in two different ways first you have to remember that the events in march didnt make people i mean we all read the popular press and most individuals begin to think about what is the most riskfree asset that being us treasuries so one should not be surprised that they begin to move assets into us treasuries so i do think that its a function also of uncertainty and not just the absolute level of where interest rates are or arent now as i said we have these moments that are opportunistic both when you think about the corporate activity and then when you think about the individual activity so both for isg and in wealth management and that was evidenced last august last october and then earlier in january and february that when markets become calm that you begin to see movements into asset classes and further activity as evidenced by our selfdirected channel as well so i dont know that theres an absolute level of rates but i would say its related to confidence in the system more broadly and a belief in asset levels being in a place that will bottom and then potentially will rise as we go forward james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i totally agree with that i think gerard if people can get a 4ishpercent return in a very uncertain environment thats not a bad thing to have in your portfolio at least for of their portfolio as they get better visibility as we all get better visibility of when the fed stops moving and did we go into this recession that some are fearing or not or if its modest then i think you start seeing more engagement i mean its just weve all been through this its human behavior weve had a pretty significant shock to the system in the last few months which thankfully the world kind of the financial world got through but could have turned sideways and higher rates came at a time of increased uncertainty so its entirely rational that people would take advantage of higher rates and increased uncertainty by pocketing cash but theyre not going to stay in cash at forever thats not going to happen gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc no thank you i appreciate that and then just as a followup question sharon you talked about the credit the provision and linking it to commercial real estate of the total loan portfolio what percentage of that is in commercial real estate mortgages and are there any construction loans in that portfolio morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley as it relates specifically to the construction loans i dont know about the exact construction loans that you might have im certain that somewhere there could be a construction loan but more broadly i think the absolute level we do disclose from the isg side around that billion and that was in our filings from last quarter operator devin ryan from jmp securities your line is open devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc hey thank you good morning i just want to start just on market share opportunities that maybe are accelerating here you touched on some on the call but one of your peers highlighted private banking in europe just on the heels of some of the banking stress or potentially even just opportunities where youre going to get paid more for committing capital when your capital is becoming more scarce in the system so just love to maybe think about some of the things that youre seeing just over the last month or so that might be sustained going forward sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley on capital opportunities in europe sorry could you repeat whats the question devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc yes the question is just where theres opportunities to take market share kind of in the wake of the banking turmoil so one peer had highlighted private banking in europe as one example but just whether theres others as well here just on the heels of the recent stress james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah devin let me have a go at that because it probably builds up the capital discussion and where wed invest we do not have an appetite for private bank in europe in fact we sold our private bank in europe to credit suisse several years ago its one of the first things i did because wed had an unhappy experience we had owned the business for years and we lost money for of them and i kind of took a fairly simple view that if you lose out of youve probably got a loser so we got out you need scale and frankly its not a good fit i believe with the current regulatory structure that we operate under so much more interested in the us and asia and some in latam the us business its just going to be an asset gathering monster to bring in billion in one quarter and trillion over the last three years there arent many companies in the world that have trillion assets under management so i think weve got to keep our eye on the prize here and not get distracted by going down some rabbit hole because somebody else is in stress maybe somebody else is in stress because its not a very attractive rabbit hole when you get down inside it we know what weve got here and its a killer machine asia is growing nicely again latam some but the workplace conversion is a massive opportunity now that were focused on obviously were tracking financial advisors from seeing of a somewhat of a safe harbor i guess across the industry and our organic flows if you compare them to our traditional competitors the wire houses or morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 the online brokers our organic flows i think are on an annualized basis significantly higher than the traditional players and higher than anybody in the industry so thats how we think about it again asia more interesting europe not interesting latam a little bit interesting and us definitely interesting devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc got it okay thank you helpful just a followup it sounds like youre starting to see maybe a little bit better momentum with financial sponsor clients so id love to maybe just touch on those specifically and kind of what the appetite is to do deals or to sell assets and kind of what you think the trigger point is to kind of engage them further sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley certainly i mentioned this actually when i spoke at a february conference this year which is that when you think about financial sponsors they may be in a different position than what we would consider traditional ma ie theyre faster to market they are in position where you might not have the same level of activity from a board and because of the size you might have different regulatory restrictions and so from that perspective we would expect that they might be first before we see really traditional activity open up and that is that remains kind of the view that we have and also as the pipeline begins to build thats also what were seeing in order for that to move forward and become realized its really about the opening of the markets in terms of the financing activity as we have seen some of the backlogs clear thats clearly very helpful but again its about stabilization and its about confidence operator well move next to mike mayo from wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi what is going so right in asia that its your third best quarter in an environment like this and then what is going so wrong in investment management since you closed eaton vance the first full quarter it was second quarter if i have that correctly investment management revenues were down almost onefourth so shout out to certainly etrade and wealth doing well but in terms of investment management like it just looks from the outside like eaton vance isnt panning out the way you expected but first the positive on asia whats going right and then the negative on whats not going right in investment management sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley certainly so lets take asia first what we saw over the course of the quarter was china reopening obviously supporting us from the equities side in perspective in terms of client engagement and whats going right also from asia has been what we have a franchise that we really built in japan and in an environment where interest rate dynamics change such as whats going on within japan thats certainly helped us from the macro perspective and the macro business within fixed income so i think thats very important and critical is that it speaks to the global perspective and it speaks to our global franchise morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 why that is important when you think about investment management and i will tie the two together is that you have to invest more broadly to be able to create an environment of diversification and so asia might be asleep japan for example could be asleep for many years then all of a sudden central bank activity picks up and youre there to support your clients with that global franchise think about investment management quite similarly what were doing is we continue to build a franchise where were able to have diversified products that are there to capture our client assets you highlighted whats gone on within investment management well asset levels are down tremendously however since weve purchased and we announced the deal associated with eaton vance look at parametric weve raised over billion in that product alone again diversification of the portfolio diversification of product to be there in a period of time where you see activity thats what were trying to do and build james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah i mean mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i would just add i wouldnt frankly render a judgment yet on the eaton vance deal i think its a little soon through a challenging market environment ill tell you im personally thrilled with it and im highly confident that five years from now were going to look back and be thrilled with it a lot of people said the smith barney deal was a dumb idea and a lot of people said etrade was a dumb idea and a lot of people said we overpaid for solium and these things have moments of sort of settling if you will its like a good house its foundations have to settle and in a very challenging environment i think the business is holding up great so im very happy with that transaction great people great company some fabulous brands and i think mike if you come back and ask that questions in three years time hopefully you wont reverse the questions but maybe youll say whats going right with eaton vance and asset management and whats going wrong in some other place because im sure as i said in the rolling stones song you cant always get what you what given the environment something might be working but yeah im pretty relaxed about that one mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc no i appreciate the answer just a short followup it looks like youre not giving any nii guide or if you did i missed it and we just want some help with our models here if you want to kind of just guide us in a certain direction i mean clearly funding costs have gone up in the industry james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i mean super hard but ill be blunt we sort of guided a little higher on growth in the first quarter and came in plus which i guess was better than most but just super hard so lets get through i think lets get through this quarter well learn a lot taxes and as sharon said its kind of the numbers have reverted back to what we were morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 modeling which is good well see that well see how much of this cash starts moving well see whether theres further deposit outflows or not i mean its just super hard to guide right now so i dont think i know its sort of not i dont know if its fair or not but it makes your modeling harder which i appreciate but also i dont want to give guidance that we dont really have an intellectual basis or fact basis for doing it its just too hard were not stressed about it that much guidance i will give you but i just dont want to put numbers on a sheet of paper at this point operator well move next to matt oconnor from deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning can you talk about the sustainability of the strong fixed income trading revenues obviously on an absolute basis very good down from a really strong year ago level and benefited from rate volatility but at the same time advisory and dcm were sluggish so how do you think about this kind of not just but the next several quarters in the current environment that were in and maybe some improvement in ib thanks sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley so our business has done and i think management has done a phenomenal job in really transforming this business to be a clientcentric model focused on velocity of assets focused on supporting our clients the deeper weve gotten into that the more weve been able to grow our wallet share more broadly and weve been able to be in and around this number so thats clearly based on the activity that weve seen now to your point should we see an opening up of markets could there be greater activity that would also obviously support the wallet more broadly but we would expect to be there to continue to gain our appropriate share of that client activity matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then maybe just broadly speaking like as you think about prime brokerage in both ficc and equity like whats your thought there in terms of committing capital kind of on an incremental basis like providing more or less from here or not really any change sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley we continue to invest in that business more broadly you can see that even on the technology side were really proud of the equity franchise and business and the transformation thats had for well over a decade being a market leader clearly as we think about committing capital its also again about our clients being active in that market as we see and i highlighted this in my prepared remarks as you see client balances increase weve obviously been there to support our clients and we are looking for the appropriate riskadjusted return as we continue to invest in that business james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah id just add if you step back from this sort of over a fiveyear view firstly just take hats off to the team led by ted and sam kelliesmith and then jay hallik and jakob horder in fixed income its come a long way from i morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 think a share i think we troughed at and i dont even know after crisis it might have been much lower but sort of 6ishpercent share perhaps for the last decade and then steadily moved up to now and pretty stable its kind of what we wanted i mean and on the equity side you can buy share for sure more but you want to be in the part of the prime brokerage business that we want to be in we dont want to be in sort of the broker of last resort so but if you step back from it and what youve really got is kind of an oligopolytype structure emerged out of the financial crisis where a smaller number of institutions have the global capability for global sales and trading and were now one of them and that was probably not a given years ago it certainly wasnt a given and youve just seen obviously credit suisse has been merged and that business lots of parts of that business i suspect disappear relating to the trading side in the prime brokerage so our position gets stronger not weaker all that said we are pretty careful about how much balance sheet we want to use to grow aggressively on the margin because we simply have good options in terms of wealth and asset management businesses so its a balancing act but i think the teams done a great job and i feel really good about where they landed the plane this quarter tricky quarter by the way particularly in rates operator well hear next from jeremy sigee from bnp jeremy sigee q analyst exane bnp paribas thank you just quite a specific one actually i thought comp costs were a bit heavy in wealth and in investment management and you mentioned deferred comp plans linked to investment performance is that heavier deferred comp cost is that something that stays with us throughout the year or does it move around is that a specific or is that stuck with us for the rest of the year as well sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley jeremy as you remember that moves around with the investments youll see both on the revenue line and the expense line and so you should look at them together and thats why weve enhanced the disclosure so that you can think about them from both sides understand both the margin and the comp ratio both historically and as we move forward jeremy sigee q analyst exane bnp paribas thats perfect thank you operator there are no further questions at this time ladies and gentlemen this concludes todays conference thank you
