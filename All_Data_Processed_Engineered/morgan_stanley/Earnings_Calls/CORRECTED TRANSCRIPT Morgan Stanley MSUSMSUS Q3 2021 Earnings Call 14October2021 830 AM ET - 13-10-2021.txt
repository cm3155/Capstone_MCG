reproduced without our consent i will now turn the call over to chairman and chief executive officer james gorman james patrick gorman chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley thank you good morning everyone thanks for joining us it was an exceptional third quarter the firm delivered and its contributed to yeartodate revenues of billion to put this in context yeartodate revenues surpassed full year revenues by nearly as of this stage our business model continues to generate durable revenues high returns and strong operating leverage and we produced an rotce of over both in the quarter and on a yeartodate basis morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 institutional securities continues to gain share it performed strongly across all regions and all three major businesses the work we have done to integrate our businesses across investment banking is clearly paying dividends of note investment banking had its best quarter in history and within that ma also produced its own record quarter equities are extremely strong and fixed income was stable the wealth management business which includes etrade now of course is growing assets at levels far beyond what weve seen through the first nine months this business added over billion of net new assets compounding growth on a client asset base of over trillion and we believe this is going to be an economic engine for morgan stanley for decades to come the majority of our advisors had positive net new assets yeartodate and its this broadbased strength thats key to driving these asset levels were seeing momentum though across all our newer channels selfdirected and workplace selfdirected client engagement remains elevated us corporate stock plan wins increased over versus last year in the quarter we continued to broaden our reach especially through morgan stanley at work where we now have in excess of million unique relationships while its early days we believe that over time morgan stanley at work will be a meaningful growth driver for the overall business providing additional connectivity to a wider range of prospective clients for broader wealth management services in investment management feebased asset management revenues were billion in the quarter by the way thats nearly triple the average quarterly level of five years ago our trillion of assets under management represents a more diverse asset mix further enhancing the range of value we can provide clients expanded solutions and customization sustainability and valueadded fixed income along with our sizable and growing alternatives platform position us well to capitalize on ongoing secular growth trends yeartodate net flows within investment management have exceeded billion finally as it relates to capital we bought back billion of stock consistent with our overall capital plan and doubled our dividend thereby delivering shareholders nearly return all that said were not complacent and while theres obviously a slightly more turbulent market environment we do expect the federal reserve will begin tapering soon and that will be followed by increasing rates in we remain optimistic about the firms position and business outlook but well exercise more caution if we see a significant uptick in volatility throughout we remain committed to our core values that drive our culture and ensure we do business the right way a final word on capital as you know saccr the standardized counterparty credit risk sic standardized approach for counterparty credit risk regulatory change is beginning next year for the largest banks it impacts the calculation of counterparty credit risk and thus riskweighted assets weve decided to early adopt in the fourth quarter that of course increases rwas and with that lowers the implied cet1 ratio our current cet1 ratio which includes the impact of our recently doubled dividend and our buyback as of the third quarter is the pro forma impact of saccr absent further mitigation could theoretically reduce that by approximately basis points of course we have a lot of flexibility to mitigate and that work has already begun but early adoption allows us to pick up a benefit in future ccar tests which may itself offset a part of this impact over time morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 im now going to turn the call over to sharon and she will discuss the quarter in greater detail and then well both take your questions thank you sharon yeshaya chief financial officer morgan stanley thank you and good morning the firm produced revenues of billion in the third quarter once again representing one of the top three quarters of the last decade excluding integrationrelated expenses our eps was and our rotce was yeartodate revenues reached a record of billion institutional securities continues to power performance with particular strength in investment banking and equities wealth management and investment management each set yeartodate records while investing for growth our business model demonstrated operating leverage the firms yeartodate efficiency ratio improved to now to the businesses institutional securities delivered an extremely strong quarter with billion in revenues yeartodate the revenues of billion were the strongest in over a decade the integrated investment bank is working seamlessly to serve our clients and to gain share balanced revenues supported overall results advisory in particular was a standout with record quarterly and yeartodate performance importantly institutional securities is delivering remarkable operating leverage the pretax margin which was yearto date has significantly contributed to the firms strong efficiency ratio this year investment banking revenues were a record of billion increasing from the prior year exceptional performance in advisory and continued strength in underwriting drove the quarters results the americas and europe led the yearoveryear increase advisory revenues were a record billion reflecting increased completed ma activity versus the prior year results were supported by greater sector diversification compared to last year equity underwriting revenues were billion marking the fourth consecutive quarter at or above this level the increase from the prior year was driven by strength across products fixed income underwriting revenues were million the yearoveryear increase was driven by strength in noninvestment grade loans supported by the combination of the rate environment and elevated levels of eventdriven activity investment banking pipelines remain healthy across sectors and regions and activity is expected to continue on the back of current momentum financial sponsors are deploying capital and corporate clients are looking for strategic opportunities as a source for growth equity revenues were very strong increasing from the prior year to billion our equities business remains a global leader results benefited from sustained client activity throughout the quarter revenues in asia were particularly strong underscoring the importance of our diversified global footprint cash and derivative revenues were both higher versus the prior year broadbased client engagement continued through the summer months prime brokerage revenues increased versus last year on higher equity market levels fixed income revenues declined from the strong prior year to billion still the business delivered a solid third quarter micro results remained above historical averages but reflected lower revenues in securitized products and credit corporates compared to the prior year which benefited from wider bidoffer spreads macro also morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 declined versus last year with lower revenues in both rates and foreign exchange commodities was strong and revenues improved versus the prior year as north america power and gas benefited from robust client activity turning to wealth management the prior quarter will be a more relevant benchmark as a comparison period given the acquisition of etrade revenues were billion down from the prior quarter however excluding the impact of dcp which declined by approximately million the revenues increased integrationrelated costs were million excluding integrationrelated expenses pbt was billion and the margin was we realized a record of billion of net new assets which underscores the power of the assetgathering platform we have built net new assets in the quarter were strong and balanced inclusive of assets from existing clients and new clients stock plan vesting events and net recruiting yeartodate nna exceeds billion representing a annualized growth rate of beginningperiod assets in the quarter we added billion of predominantly retirement assets through an asset acquisition these incremental assets are reflected in total client assets feebased assets net new assets and feebased flows we are particularly excited about the approximately participants associated with these retirement assets who will now have access to educational content and analytical tools delivered through the financial wellness platform deepening these relationships and ultimately converting workplace relationships to advisorled or self directed clients based on their individual needs is at the core of our expansion strategy the workplace channel serves as an asset acquisition funnel that will fuel our growth over time we are excited by the momentum in the workplace yeartodate new stock plan participants have more than doubled we have nearly billion in unvested assets in the quarter transactional revenues were million excluding the impact of dcp revenues declined in line with seasonal patterns selfdirected daily average tradings were approximately in the quarter in line with the average level for the full year of while moderating from the exceptionally high activity seen earlier this year client engagement remains high darts this quarter were three times above etrades pre acquisition record asset management revenues were billion up sequentially yeartodate these revenues increased to a record billion the strength in feebased flows supports our view that clients first consolidate assets under our platform and then migrate these assets to advisory bank lending balances grew billion sequentially to billion and have grown yeartodate growth in securitiesbased lending and mortgages drove the increase reflecting strong client demand for new lines and increased household participation net interest income was billion prepayment amortization was negligible in the quarter but it did impact the sequential move excluding for prepay for both quarters nii was up benefiting from the incremental growth in lending balances and decreased deposit costs for the remainder of the year we expect nii to build sequentially on the back of loan growth at a pace slightly below the third quarter the integration of etrade remains on track today dual clients of etrade and morgan stanley can choose to provide their morgan stanley advisor with visibility into their etrade accounts by year end clients will be able to link their selfdirected accounts via single signon building on our digital client experience morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 moving to investment management the timing of the eaton vance acquisition makes the prior quarter a more relevant benchmark revenues were billion declining while asset management and related fees rose sequentially the increase was offset by lower performancebased income and other revenue total aum remains strong at trillion total net flows were billion in the quarter driven by liquidity and overlay services longterm flows reflected a single redemption of billion in our solutions business by a large asset manager the redemption was approximately half of the asset managers aum with us and we expect the remainder of the aum to be redeemed in the first half of as the asset manager brings its equity trading implementation inhouse excluding this idiosyncratic outflow we saw positive longterm net flows with continued demand for parametric customized portfolios private real estate and private credit and sustainable strategies through both calvert and msim funds asset management and related fees were billion reflecting the high proportion of durable and recurring revenues in this business performancebased income and other revenues were a loss of million in the quarter gains across the platform were offset by lower accrued carried interest in our asia private equities business primarily driven by a single underlying public investment in one of the funds the broadening of our growing alternatives portfolio helps mitigate this overall impact finally the integration with eaton vance remains on pace we continue to invest in secular growth areas particularly sustainability alternatives and customization for wealth management platforms and clients turning to the balance sheet total spot assets increased to trillion riskweighted assets grew by approximately billion primarily driven by increased client activity in the quarter we continue to deliver on our commitment to return capital to shareholders and are executing on our billion buyback authorization buying back billion of stock in the quarter our standardized cet1 ratio now stands at as james mentioned we intend to early adopt saccr during the fourth quarter this year after taking into consideration the potential benefits to certain capital metrics such as the future scb calculations with our current portfolio size and mix the adoption would imply an estimated increase to our riskweighted assets of approximately billion to billion this would also imply a reduction to our cet1 ratio by approximately basis points upon adoption we have commenced mitigation efforts which should offset some of the impacts to our cet1 ratio we will continue to remain well capitalized post the adoption of saccr we continue to benefit from the diversification of our franchise the firm is firing on all cylinders as we enter the end of the year on a strong footing we are capturing share in institutional securities clients remain engaged and pipelines are healthy we are excited by the momentum we see in wealth managements ability to attract and consolidate assets and the benefits of the improved diversification in investment management importantly we are meaningfully investing in technology across all of our businesses with that we will now open the line up to questions morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi your line is now open glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much im curious the flows in the wealth management channel continue to impress i think you guys are by far the largest distributor of alternative assets and as that space grows and as that becomes a bigger part of client portfolio i wonder if you could help us frame have you ever broken out either the asset level or percentage of high net worth portfolios that you have today versus where you think that can grow to sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley i think hi glenn its sharon i think if memory serves me there was a strategy deck that we did in or that does give a portfolio mix that you can see for advisoryled assets so it can give you some sense rough sense from those documents what i would say though that i had also noticed this trend when we go through it there has been a slight shift but youre obviously talking about a very large asset base but i would definitely say that both anecdotally and it does bear out in some of the numbers that you see a slight increase towards alternatives as a composition of the portfolio glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay maybe just a quick followup on your saccr comments because they were reasonably comprehensive which specific assets are most impacted just so i can think through mitigation and how much of an impact it can make and then im curious what does early adoption do for you besides like brownie points like how does that possibly help in future ccars james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah and glenn in case youre confused this is james the accents are so different on saccr i mean it affects counterparty credit risks there were models that were in place that basel has been working on replacing actually starting and the idea was to implement it in and they relate to most of the derivative contracts and the determination where their margin and op margin how to treat that from a riskweighted asset perspective so theres a complicated formula that applies a weighting to default risk and then the npv of future payment obligations under various contracts so its taken a while for them to get it done they actually deferred it i think during covid theyve given the banks till the beginning of next year to put it in place and theyre allowing banks to preannounce the benefit of starting early is it affects the peak to trough in your ccar calculations during the ccar cycle so there will be some offsets later and we just felt we needed to get into it sooner rather than later most of it is in isg i think about if lets say the rwa number i think weve got at billion to billion honestly thats moving around a little bit because this is complicated stuff but we certainly dont think its worse morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 and hopefully its the lower end of that some of it is in the wealth business because of all the options in that business but its a relatively small part of it i think like operator our next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs your line is now open brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions id like to start on net new assets in wealth sharon i believe you flagged an acquisition of a retirement business number one like this is basically just a team right of consultants that will sit within wealth so it could be call it a largescale recruiting is that fair and number two is the idea that you guys are interested in getting more importantly and more sort of strategically is the idea that you guys want to get a little bit more aggressive in 401k dc plans in order to complement the stock plan business and enhance the workplace offering sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley so id say holistically brennan nice to speak to you its fair i think that it is a largescale team that you can consider in terms of that asset acquisition i think that as you rightly point out it is an extension of our strategy and what youre really trying to think about is how do you get more participants that you can touch that you can begin to sell both products and assets that are appropriate for them but more than that offer them true services like financial wellness that were already doing through the stock plan business so if you think of retirement assets and then you think of whos the actual holder of those retirement assets and those are the participants through municipalities pensions et cetera then all of a sudden you have just another layer of people that you first offer financial wellness and education to and then you can introduce them to the services that morgan stanley has the same way that you would introduce the services to a workplace client so an extension of a strategy and a continuation of the concept of the funnel james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley my key takeaway on because this is a very important topic broadly my key takeaway on it is we used to have a very monolithic model for asset gathering you had existing clients who maybe brought new money to you from other institutions or accumulated wealth they also spent wealth so that would go up and down you had financial advisors who left and who you recruited and for many years we were frankly net deficit of financial advisors as were frankly most of the brokerdealers in my years of doing this a couple of years ago the net deficit changed materially for us we are seeing net positive attrition very few advisors leaving and significant advisors coming particularly large teams from across the street in the banking industry so thats a positive the channel that the workplace has opened up and the opportunity to gather assets which was a part of the driver between behind this quarters numbers is basically a new channel and then obviously the etrade channel is a new channel and now youre seeing the sort of acquisition of riatype teams of which this is one morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 so its gone from sort of a one model a defense and attack model of keep your people and try and get some of the marketplace to a multipronged model which if we obviously we cant predict the future but it looks like this is set up to have multiple channels of growth in the years ahead which is the strategy operator our next question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research your line is now open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley hey steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so sticking along that same topic of just the corporate stock plan business it looks like the organic growth continues to sustain really strong momentum in terms of new corporate stock plan adds and i was just curious how client conversion levels are tracking today within your ecosystem relative to the levels you were seeing prior to the etrade deal and was hoping you can just provide a broader update not just on the corporate stock plan momentum but even just how youre tracking with the revenue synergy targets from etrade since you announced the deal sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley sure its nice to speak to you steve so i would just echo what you said yes we saw us stock plan wins increase over last year so just to put that out there and put it in perspective as you think about conversion were still working through some of the metrics as it relates to retention but anecdotally we are seeing strong retention obviously there were different metrics as you think about what etrade defined as retention and how you might define retention going forward given this new structure but i think that the synergies as theyve played out are very strong we obviously never gave a direct revenue target but if you think about what etrade was doing its the concept was always well how you think about the whole spectrum of client wealth and so were seeing our teams work very closely together were thinking about new ways to offer morgan stanley services like research et cetera and advice that you would see through your advisor also through your etrade portal and all of thats really much in track and on we continue to think about meeting our companion accounts for example which was right now and in the us account by next year so all of those sort of touch points and milestones were on track and we look forward to giving you i think more detail as you think about the january deck next year operator our next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is now open bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 yes hi good morning this is actually bernie von gizycki on from matts team thanks for taking my question so my question relates to the investment banking backdrop and how it relates to direct listings so investment banking results are very strong and as you previously noted pipelines remain healthy across sectors and regions and momentum should continue so with that said theres been a number of direct listings this year versus just one in given morgan stanley has been an advisor on a number of these deals could you share your observations if the increase of these private to public structures although small in numbers still have been more of a byproduct of a favorable market backdrop or is it more of a structural change in the private markets and any comments you could share on future industry pipelines for direct listings sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley sure i think that the key point that weve always said about direct listings is that its another tool in the tool kit and its really dependent on a client situation and the needs at that point in time so these are specific situations but i would say that that while potentially can be a contributor to the advisory results what i would focus you on for advisory are two things one is the diversification across the sectors and the geography so what were seeing is not just one product necessarily driving results or one sector driving results but rather that the pipelines broadly are healthy and as james said last year we continue to invest in this business so i think thats sort of how we think about the business going forward operator our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc capital your line is now open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning sharon james can you guys share with us obviously the markets have been very strong you guys have done a great job obviously in capturing that growth along with some of your peers do you have any sense what normalization would be in the markets and how you would what kind of market share you could maintain in a more normalized market whether thats somewhere between and today but any color there and then second james you talked about increased volatility what are some of the metrics youre looking at to measure if the markets became more volatile and you guys would maybe get a little more defensive thank you james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well on the normalized markets its clearly been a major shift between the us and nonus institutions post crisis and im talking about capital markets here gerard the barriers to entry for those businesses if you look at a lot of the regional banks and investment banks that try to be global investment banks and didnt work out so well the scale economics of it the barriers to entry are just so large and frankly the technology is so demanding and complex that its pretty hard to be a wannabe or a new entrant trying to break into the group that is dominating sort of the global flow of capital markets and within that were obviously performing very well weve picked up a lot of share consistently across fixed income and equities and increasingly in banking over the last several years i dont see that abating i mean i dont see a compelling reason why that would change in the wealth and asset management space again scale is your friend weve done two huge deals in the last year and then smith barney a decade ago at 65ish trillion clearly at scale were one of the biggest asset morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 managers and wealth managers in the world and that generates about billion in revenue again its hard to pick up advisors onebyone and there arent that many firms out there of size that really move the needle on scale and there arent really any direct firms of size you saw the schwabameritrade deal which combined two competitors youve got fidelity youve got a couple of smaller ones but etrade was kind of the last big one that was available so im pretty confident about our market position i dont see why it would deteriorate at this point doesnt mean it cant but that would be more internal what weve done to ourselves than external what the market is going to do to us is my gut on that on volatility i mean youre looking at all sorts of stuff youre looking at the daytoday movements in market prices youre looking at when the fed starts tapering what the impact of the market is what they start signaling in terms of how many dots suggest there will be rate increases next year its gone from i think four to nine thats going to introduce volatility some of the geopolitical discussions around obviously uschina relationships taiwan that injects volatility so like anything we look at sort of monetary policy inflation numbers geopolitics and then see how that bleeds into market activity and from that we sort of dial up or down on the margin our risk and youre looking you look at specific transactions you look at multiples of ebitda the deals are done at youre looking at days of distribution on syndicated deals i mean theres a lot of sort of more tactical stuff but i try and take a thematic view and my thematic view is its good to be watchful right now theres certainly nothing to suggest there are any issues but the markets are bouncing a little bit and over the next months well see more of that as the fed starts to move operator our next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities your line is now open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi can you hear me james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yes mike hey mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey how are you doing look during the quarter you made what seemed like a pretty significant announcement with a partnership with microsoft and im not really sure about the ramifications of that it looks like youre going to use microsoft to transition more to the public cloud if i have that correctly and then youre also going to be providing services to microsoft to help them position their business but i wasnt really clear on that so if you could give dimension that talk about maybe efficiency benefits by using the cloud how much do you want to transition your workload to the cloud and then what is it that youd be doing in return james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 yeah it was an important deal obviously microsoft is one of the great companies in the world if not the largest company in the world so a fantastic partner for us we did do a multiyear deal with them i wont give you the financials as you would understand but a multiyear deal with them and by the way theyre not the only cloud provider we use there are great players in aws and google and we have relationships with all of them but we wanted to make a significant move it gives us more capacity to process and analyze data it gives us timeto market tools theres more resilience and flexibility in the cloud obviously some of the digital initiatives that were using to improve our client experience we do through the cloud so its one of the pillars of our technology strategy weve tried to drive more innovation across our businesses if you look at what weve done in wealth management with some of the virtual financial advisor the leadiq platform next best ideas these kinds of things theyre all aidriven and i think what youre seeing is with first the acquisition of solium and then in etrade our wealth businesses have a much much stronger technology backbone and weve been driving a lot of innovation in that space the cloud decision with microsoft is really a corporate one and i think will just lead to a much more efficient morgan stanley and more resilient by the way but its not solely microsoft were very proud of our partnership with them but were a huge company and were going to keep evolving we have developed a special relationship with them on some other things that were working on that i dont want to go into obviously on the call thats between us and microsoft but its a great move mike were really happy about it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so can you dimension what you think the potential savings are or how much workload you might move or give us some sense i think what were finding is some banks like capital one are on the public cloud and then theres a series of other banks that dont really want to be on the public cloud where are you in that continuum do you want to like have more of a private cloud or do you want to be more on the public cloud and what kind of savings do you think you could get james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah i can dimension savings obviously were balancing it between both private and public capital one has a very different business model they dont do ma they dont underwrite equity deals they dont have global trading businesses so its a really a function of you drive your technology decisions based upon the path to innovation and what your business model needs to support different technologies one of the programs rob rooney and the team set up several years ago is something we call our distinguished engineers we have some unbelievably capable engineers software engineers computer scientists around the world who work with us and weve created a cohort where theyre basically driving and feeding innovation across the firm so no i cant break it down to a simple you go to the cloud and it will improve our efficiency ratio by it just i cant do that but i do know that when you drive it down into the actual business activities its making us both a more efficient more resilient and fastermoving player and frankly being in partnership with microsoft is a very good thing for morgan stanley theyre bestinclass as a company as a tech company operator our next question comes from the line of dan fannon with jefferies your line is now open morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning i was hoping you could expand a bit on the advisor trends you talked about larger advisor groups coming over the recruiting if you can maybe put some numbers around that in the context of kind of maybe previous periods year ago or something prior to that and maybe the backlog or the outlook for advisor growth as you think about the next kind of 12month time period james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah we dont dan we dont put out numbers on actual teams that we bring in we have a weekly report which i get every friday night about and scrutinize it pretty closely and it shows which people weve recruited what their trailing 12months revenue are what their assets are and then which ones we lose to different competition and what the sources are where theyre going to and as i said ive been doing this a long time and at my previous firm and here for most of that period we were net deficit we were losing advisors to rias who were moving sometimes to private banks youre losing some of the smaller producers to places like linsco private ledger that has all turned and i think the power of the brand i mean if youre the beauty of having this integrated investment bank combined with this wealth and asset management business is youve now got worldclass parametric calvert sustainability funds to offer our advisors worldclass op platform through infrastructure mezz finance private equity real estate but youve also got new issuance i mean were so active in the equity markets that if youre a worldclass advisor managing and some of our advisors have teams of theyre managing books of billion and billion i mean they are enormous operations themselves so do you want to take a book of several billion dollars to a firm that is not a global leader in the equities markets and is not a global leader in underwriting i dont think so so weve got a huge competitive advantage by having such a worldclass investment bank which feeds the advisors plus the research which we amortize across the cost of all the three platforms enables us to invest more in research than you do if youre just a wealth shop or youre just an institutional shop so again we dont break down individual teams but and its more than anecdotal i have the numbers obviously in front of me well not literally in front of me but in my office and its real were getting very big teams coming in operator our next question comes from the line of devin ryan with jmp securities your line is now open devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc great good morning want to come back to some of the comments on investment banking strength and obviously the expected ongoing momentum there it feels like a number of the areas are still actually seeing acceleration even in the third quarter like advisory and so thats driving investor questions around how much of this is structural versus just being in a great cycle and as we think about i guess sharon some of the comments you made about sponsors playing a bigger role im just curious like how you guys would quantify how much bigger that part of your business is today relative to maybe a few years ago because clearly thats an area where theres more capital and sponsors are kind of always transacting so just love to get some sense of how much bigger that is and whether that could continue morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley sure i think if you think about sponsors but if you really think about everything right whats gone on is you have cash that youve raised and debt in other parts of the market given where the industry was at the beginning of the pandemic and so you have the cash that needs to be deployed be that either from a corporate or from a sponsor et cetera and as you push that through the system people are looking for opportunities for growth either from the corporate lens or from the financial sponsors lens so i would say that its an active part of the business its not the only part of the business though and thats the point that i was trying to make before when i mentioned sector diversification so you might look at a financial sponsor as a sector but you can also think about all different types of materials or retail or consumer discretionary et cetera all of that that pie in terms of where its coming from is changing and that diversification i think is whats helping the activity and i think that corporations are looking for growth and so id say that its not just one sleeve that is driving what the results that you saw at least over the course of this quarter and the future pipeline devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc sure okay appreciate that and then just a followup here wealth management terrific momentum on the lending side as we think about the evolution here of morgan stanley winning a higher percentage of the overall customers balance sheet or their wallet where do you guys feel like you are at the moment on the liability side relative to kind of the potential and then are there any other products there that could be an interesting kind of extension or kind of a focus for growth sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley i think that it continues to be the beginning of that process and so when you think about where we came from and then the penetration that weve seen from the household side the numbers are still small and so while there is a loan growth momentum and weve obviously done quite well theres technology that james mentioned thats also in the loan space so if you are an advisor and you see somebody or you receive information that theyve looked that your client has looked at a mortgage calculator for example youll get notified youll speak to your client about the product that you might have and so i think that that extension of how you use technology to service your client better and then also just the sheer numbers given that we became a bank later in our life cycle provides further runway for growth along that space james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i would just add when we bought etrade they had a relatively small loan book and that was for good reason i dont know if you remember devin but i forget exactly what year it was it was probably when they had problems with this large heloc portfolio they had and that made them very gun shy about the lending space so just our mortgage products alone has enormous capacity with the etrade clients and thats even before you get to start to think about the stock plan clients ultimately we just think about converting their equity grants morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2021 into accounts thats sort of project number one but project number two is obviously managing their full liability side as well so a lot of space to go devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay terrific thank you operator our last question comes from the line of andrew lim with soc gén your line is now open andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk hi good morning thanks for taking my question so crypto has been in the news lately and i just wanted to get your view on how you expect that space developing and your strategy and how to offer products to clients how do you expect to engage with clients in the crypto space james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley were not directly trading crypto for retail clients and there are other players who are choosing to do that we give access for them to buy crypto through various funds and things but listen ive said it publicly before and ill say it again i dont think crypto is a fad i dont think its going to go away i dont know what the value of bitcoin should or shouldnt be but these things arent going away and the blockchain technology supporting it is obviously very real and powerful so it remains andrew a working space but for us honestly its just not a huge part of the business demand from our clients and that may evolve and well evolve with it but right now its certainly not whats driving our economics one way or the other but were watchful of it were respectful and well wait and see how the regulators handle it andrew lim q
