call 19jan2022 james patrick gorman chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley thank you good morning everyone morgan stanley delivered another record year of profits and results in generating a full year rotce of performance was strong in each business in institutional securities we showed strength and gained share and in wealth management we added over billion of net new assets bringing total client assets to nearly trillion we drove our strategic vision forward in investment management successfully closing our acquisition of eaton vance earlier in the year and created a premier asset manager which itself has trillion of assets under management sharon will discuss the details of the quarter and the full year shortly but first as always i will walk through our annual strategic update if you turn to the document and start on slide at the beginning of last year we set two year objectives with the expectation that would be a transition year as we worked through our integrations clearly the firms performance exceeded the expectations we had for heading into that year with the early successes of the etrade and eaton vance acquisitions and the firms overall momentum we entered ahead of plan turn to slide first ill focus on our 12year transformation and where the firm is today history offers perspective on our track record next ill highlight where weve built unique competitive advantages around each of our businesses and how we expect to grow and maintain our leading positions then i will address our continued commitment to return capital to our shareholders and finally ill touch on how when taken together this should lead to further multiple expansion to begin with our longerterm evolution slide highlights the transformation morgan stanley into a more balanced higher returning firm today total revenues are more than double the level of with each business significantly growing and contributing to the firms enhanced profitability each of our businesses now have defensible and sustainable competitive advantages to protect and drive their leading positions start with institutional securities on slide looking back to when wed recovered from the financial crisis but before we reset our strategy and restructured some of this business weve increased share both overall and individually across business lines share continues to aggregate to the industry leaders and we expect this trend to hold our competitive position is strong and as demonstrated in the very active markets of the last two years were confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities to hold if not gain share across the division moving to slide our integrated investment bank delivered billion of revenues in and continues to demonstrate operating leverage highlighted by our expanding margins our footprint is balanced around the world putting us in a leading tier of investment banks with global scale our franchise has never been stronger and we have seen tangible results from the collaboration between our segments shifting to wealth management on slide the growth we had seen in has been unprecedented we added nearly trillion in client assets in a single year scale advantages propelled growth and we added billion of net new assets in the last months this predominantly organic growth is the result of our consistent and focused execution on our integration and expansion initiatives and puts us in a leading position the journey over the last few years has demonstrated the art of the possible with respect to net new asset growth this business has gone from very low single digits in the last decade to to more recently to unprecedented growth this year obviously its still early days but the verticals are in place before we commit to specific guidance for net new asset growth we need more time to better understand the power of these channels morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 but what i can tell you is that the proof points are strong and we feel great about where we are today in the business potential turn to slide with the top advisorled business in the industry complemented by leading workplace and self directed offerings the wealth franchise weve built is a category of one we already serve nearly trillion of client assets and overall revenue on assets remains high at over basis points underlining this segment as an economic engine for the firm as we think about the growth ahead were most excited about the nearly million relationships we have across channels and the potential to deepen those relationships further and consolidate client assets onto the platform on slide we look more closely at workplace which im incredibly excited about for the future as we have said before we see this channel as a funnel for client and asset acquisition to sustain growth going forward we now have over billion of unvested assets in this channel and expect to retain an increasing proportion as they vest in we had a retention rate that compares with the previous year given our focused effort our longterm goal is to reach retention this new metric illustrates the strength of the workplace business to augment net new assets to wealth management moving to investment management on slide our platform has transformed into a premier and growing asset manager our distinctive capabilities enable us to deliver differentiated client value as endorsed by billion of net flows in the year total aum is now trillion and our more durable asset management fees are nearly triple what they were in if you look closer at our investment management business on slide you can see were a leader and growing where it matters most customization specifically direct indexing through the premier parametric brand sustainability and alternatives are each areas of increasing client demand we have strengthened our position across these categories with robust investment capabilities and weve seen meaningful asset under management growth as a result moreover the complementary nature of distribution networks with eaton vances powerful us retail distribution capabilities and msims strength in international distribution enhances our client reach were encouraged by early signs of success in leveraging the greater combined network along with our worldclass equity franchise and valueadded fixed income platform and we expect these areas will continue to drive growth into the future finally on slide sic as we look ahead we expect rates to rise we expect approximately million of incremental nii in wealth management this year based on the year end forward curve additionally we expect another million this year from the reversal of fee waivers in our investment management business to further measure our rate sensitivity we look at what happens if there is an incremental basis point parallel shift in rates beyond the curve that would deliver another billion which largely goes to the bottom line while we certainly dont expect this additional shift to happen this year the firm will clearly benefit substantially as rates rise over the next several years pivoting to our capital return strategy on slide our increased earnings power supported by revenues from more durable sources has enabled us to double our annualized dividend to just last year while at the same time executing our meaningful share repurchases notwithstanding the returns were making to shareholders and the investments we make in our business we continue to have an excess capital position our cet1 ratio was at year end after paying our dividend executing on our repurchase plan and accounting for the impact of saccr morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 and as further illustrated on slide growing net income has provided us the flexibility to reduce our share count while we added million shares from our two large acquisitions of etrade and eaton vance we continue to execute on our meaningful buyback program and have brought back our share count back to just under billion from billion in taking all this together slide highlights the fundamentals we have in place to drive future multiple expansion we have scale significant growth opportunities in wealth and investment management coupled with a leading institutional business and a strong commitment to capital return the morgan stanley brand has never been stronger weve been fortunate enough to acquire additional brands in the last few years that have tremendous value in expanding our footprint the sum of these elements supports multiple expansion for the combined company slide shows our performance goals of note we are increasing our rotce goal to reflect the earnings power we see in our business model we are laserfocused on delivering value to our clients our shareholders and our employees and we believe an rotce in excess of is achievable as we look to the longer term with the support of our track record behind us were adding a new goal a long term goal to achieve trillion in client assets across wealth and investment management as always our targets are subject of course to major market moves or changes in the economic political and regulatory environment however with the outlook we have now we fully expect to achieve our goals ill now turn the call over to sharon who will discuss our fourth quarter and annual results and together we will take your questions thank you sharon yeshaya chief financial officer morgan stanley thank you and good morning the firm produced record revenues of billion in and ended the year on a strong footing with fourth quarter revenues of billion all three businesses contributed to the extremely strong full year results reflecting high levels of client engagement and active markets excluding integration related expenses our rotce was for the full year and for the fourth quarter and eps was and respectively even while investing in our business we continue to demonstrate operating leverage led by institutional securities the full year efficiency ratio was excluding integrationrelated expenses our full year efficiency ratio was down from in total expenses in the year were billion the increase in total expenses versus the prior year reflects the addition of etrade and eaton vance and the integrationrelated costs and higher compensation on higher revenues now to the businesses institutional securities delivered excellent full year performance with record revenues of billion in the fourth quarter revenues were billion our integrated approach global footprint and balance across business lines continues to distinguish our model underscoring the operating leverage in the business pretax margin was for the full year increasing from in the prior year investment banking revenues were a record billion for the full year while each business delivered record results advisory and equity underwriting led the yearoveryear improvement corporate clients actively pursued morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 strategic opportunities and sponsored deployed capital ipo issuances were exceptionally robust in the year and from a geographical perspective results were led by the americas along with sustained strength in emea fourth quarter revenues of billion increased from the prior year driven by strength in advisory trends from the third quarter persisted particularly as results benefited from a broadening of transactions across sectors although underwriting revenues moderated overall equity issuance was strong and elevated levels of event driven activity supported fixed income we continue to invest in our investment banking business our outlook entering is strong and our pipelines continue to be healthy across products ceo confidence remains high and markets remain open and constructive additionally advisory transactions should support strong capital market issuance equity full year revenues were a record billion increasing from the prior year as client engagement remained high the increase versus the prior year was driven by strength in prime brokerage and from a geographical perspective asia revenues were billion in the quarter increased revenues in prime brokerage on higher client balances were offset by declines in cash and derivatives on lower client activity versus the prior fourth quarter this quarter also included a marktomarket gain of million on a certain strategic investment fixed income revenues were billion for the full year declining from last years exceptional results the full year decline was driven by tighter bidoffer spreads in macro and credit corporates partially offset by securitized products quarterly revenues of billion were lower than the prior year reflecting a challenging trading environment in rates and lower volumes and tighter bidoffer spreads in credit further client engagement tempered in december reflecting seasonal patterns impacting results turning to wealth management for the full year wealth management produced record revenues of billion and a pbt margin of excluding million of integrationrelated expenses the pbt margin was fourth quarter revenues were billion up from the prior year and the pbt margin was excluding integration related expenses of million the pbt margin for the quarter was quarterly margin was negatively impacted by seasonal expenses and certain compensation and benefits decisions made to further support our employees given the full annual impact of these decisions was taken in the fourth quarter the impact was amplified in this quarters margins going forward this will be spread throughout the year pro rata as we look ahead to the first quarter of we expect the pbt margin to be more in line with the full year margin excluding integrationrelated expenses this business continues to benefit from strong client demand across the platform client assets grew nearly trillion this year and now stands at trillion feebased flows were an incredible billion in the year supporting growth in feebased assets of trillion or higher than last year in the quarter asset management revenues were billion net new assets of billion in the year represent annual growth of beginningperiod assets momentum was carried through the fourth quarter which saw net new assets of billion we saw strong asset generation from both existing clients and net new clients driven by the advisorled channel we remain a destination of choice for advisors and continue to add strong teams and retain productive advisors net new assets growth is further buoyed by positive momentum in our newer channels namely workplace our results demonstrate the tremendous asset generation capability of our platform transactional revenues in the morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 fourth quarter were billion declining from the prior year excluding the impact of dcp which declined by approximately million versus prior year revenues were flat the workplace continues to gain traction our total number of participants we now reach stands at million higher than last year and unvested assets now exceed billion as james mentioned we are reporting on a new metric to show the percentage of stock plan assets that vest and remain within morgan stanley wealth management etrade previously disclosed a similar metric the definition going forward will measure the retention of the value of vested stocks on a rolling to 24month period this new metric will allow us to measure the potential strength of workplace to serve as a funnel to grow our asset base we saw retention in which compares to in as james mentioned over time we believe that number can reach retention for our stock plan administration business going forward we plan to disclose this metric annually bank lending balances grew by billion in the year and now stand at billion strong client demand for securitiesbased lending and mortgages drove the increase net interest income was billion in the quarter driven by strong lending growth and the benefit of fullyphased in funding synergies the fourth quarter nii is a reasonable base to inform this year nii will be impacted by the forward curve and lending growth on rates while the timing and the magnitude of the rate hikes is uncertain we should benefit from rising rates and the realization of the forward curve this would imply an estimated million additional nii this year largely weighted to the back half of the year on lending we continue to see strong lending demand and while growth is likely to moderate some we expect approximately billion of loan growth in the year finally the integration of etrade continues to go well we are encouraged by continued client engagement and are seeing etrade clients take advantage of morgan stanley capabilities being introduced on the etrade platform building on our digital client experience clients are now able to link their selfdirected accounts via a single signon we have successfully merged etrades bank legal entities with morgan stanleys throughout the integration efforts we continue to focus on a unified client experience while providing clients choice completing this integration successfully remains a key investment priority moving to investment management the timing of the eaton vance acquisition makes comparisons to prior periods difficult so i will make my comments primarily on an absolute basis investment management reported annual revenues of billion and quarterly revenues of billion our results continue to demonstrate the diversification of this business and a greater contribution from more durable management fee revenue total aum rose to a record high of trillion of which longterm aum was also a record at trillion total net flows were billion in the quarter driven by liquidity and overlay services longterm net flows were slightly negative for the full year net flows were billion asset management and related fees were billion in the quarter the sequential increase was driven by higher performance fees as a reminder performance fees are mostly recognized in the fourth quarter performancebased income and other revenues were million reflecting broadbased gains in our diversified alternatives platform finally the integration with eaton vance remains on track in the first half of this year we will bring a number of eaton vance and calvert funds on to our international distribution platform we are also now offering msim model portfolios on the etrade platform and we are seeing positive traction morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 turning to the balance sheet total spot assets were trillion riskweighted assets were essentially flat to the prior quarter at billion we adopted saccr on december resulting in a billion rwa increase this was offset by a decline in activity and lower market levels towards the end of the quarter our saccr mitigation efforts were better than we anticipated and resulted in an impact lower than our initial guidance to produce a better outcome we repurchased approximately billion of common stock during the quarter we remain well capitalized post the adoption of saccr and our standardized cet1 ratio now stands at flat to the prior quarter our tax rate was for the full year and absent any changes to tax law we expect our tax rate to be in line with which will exhibit some quartertoquarter volatility in terms of our outlook for calendar year the exit rate of our wealth and investment management asset base and the integrations of our acquisitions set these businesses up to continue to perform strongly in addition as james discussed the realization of the forward curve will only further support results as it relates to institutional securities while it remains difficult to forecast this business the banking pipeline looks healthy and the year has started off well that said a lot will depend on monetary and fiscal policy and its impact on sentiment with that we will now open the line up to questions question and answer section operator we are now ready to take questions operator instructions the first question is from christian bolu with autonomous christian bolu q analyst autonomous research llp good morning guys so james on the organic growth its been remarkably strong and you keep calling for a slowdown on organic growth but were not seeing any sort of evidence of slowing if anything youre accelerating here i guess a couple of questions on that can you give us a bit more flavor around whats driving organic growth how much of it is retention versus recruiting on recruiting who are you gaining share from and then i would imagine you have quite a bit of visibility into the recruiting pipeline so any sense of like how long you think this sort of strength can continue james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley good morning christian i think youre talking about net new money i assume right christian bolu q analyst autonomous research llp correct correct morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah yeah i mean its not a simple answer because in the old days it was simple it was a function of money that you lost by financial advisors leaving and money you gained by recruiting financial advisors and obviously thats a sort of sorry way to run a business it basically settles your pl for the next nine years to buy a little bit of joy in the near term fortunately weve outgrown that the source of net new money comes from several places number one as you heard the retention in the workplace space is much better than what we did preetrade i mean i think it went from to last year but preetrade it was much much lower and presolium number two the reality is wealthy people get wealthier quicker than people who are less wealthy get wealthy and weve got a lot of them now with our the sophistication of our network the linkages we have to investment banking across our top financial advisors the family offer structure the team has put in place are all drivers of growth that we didnt have before i mean just the new assets that are brought in from our investment banking relationships sort of across the house whereas in the past we never really introduced across the house its truly running like one firm thirdly were just not losing many people i mean thats the reality relative to previous years weve been significant net gainers and thats not because were doing stupid recruiting deals thats because were not losing a lot of people now we are doing recruiting deals there are talented people in the market theyre not coming from one particular firm or another we dont focus on firms we focus on individuals and that has been doing well then you add in things like the technology the team has put in place in wealth management so the virtual advisortype technology where you leverage the best talent we have across the whole country or the alt platform that has been built out where we now provide the product that you would have had to go to another firm to get and finally you bring in the deposits and what weve done with the bank and the online banking and then you throw on top of that etrade and whats thats been doing ph in growth and so christian its an interesting story its many many parts which is why were confident its going to keep going just recruiting thats different you turn that spigot on or off but its not just recruiting so i think theres going to be strong organic growth i mean these numbers wed said unprecedented for a reason it had never wed never seen its organic growth yearoveryear thats got to be the best in the industry and overwhelmingly the best in our history and its better than frankly many of the traditional fastergrowing so called fastergrowing companies so were really excited about that as you know i dont think or is realistic to hold but certainly were not going back to anywhere near where we were in the old days sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley if i can also add to it christian i would just say if you actually look at the data its relatively as james said balanced across many of these different sectors but as you think of just the advisor channel youre seeing not only weve i think spent a lot of time speaking to the community around assets held away we are seeing existing clients bringing assets as well as new clients bringing assets to the advisorled channel so you are seeing a balance of both morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 christian bolu q analyst autonomous research llp okay thank you for my second question on expenses really nice control in the quarter but all your peers are speaking about elevated expense growth going forward to retain talent and just to invest for growth can you talk about just longer term how youre thinking about balancing sort of that good expense control that we like while continuing to invest in for the long term sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah i think we have managed expenses well i think that we always are cognizant of the pressures around expenses both on the wage side and on the noncomp side if you think about the comp side i think we constantly feel that weve paid for performance and thats sort of in the model that we have but if you also think about the noncomps were investing in our integration were investing in technology resiliency cyber and i think were also putting in place different types of investments as you think about positioning morgan stanley out for growth and making sure that we have the right people and the processes in place to do that but there is also inherent operating margin or excuse me operating leverage in the model and thats been something that weve been able to demonstrate i think this quarter as well as over the course of the year james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah id say christian obviously this is going to be a hot topic because its all anybody wants to talk about all of a sudden is expense management for im not going to talk about competitors but youve got to look at business models i mean were a different business model just take our wealth management business which is 24plus billion in revenue those advisors are paid on a grid there is no inflation on it its based upon what they produce most of our investment bank is similarly paid based on bonus and thats based on what they produce what our performance is if that goes up they go up which they did this year and we were thrilled to do that so weve invested a lot in technology but weve also bought companies i said before we didnt just buy etrade and solium and eaton vance we bought technology businesses within them which we would have been developing ourselves the online banking business within etrade the solium workplace platform which is basically its basically software programming business the parametric platform within eaton vance all of these are things which if wed built would have been very expensive so buy versus build we made that tradeoff so its a combination of all of those were very comfortable with our expense situation right now and i dont know were just i guess its a different business model christian bolu q analyst autonomous research llp okay thank you operator the next question is from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 good morning thanks for taking my question sharon just wanted to ask a question on the slide that youve got in the deck on the realization in forward curve as well as the liquidity revenue and whatnot so im guessing that the million in liquidity revenue is waivers and the recovery of waivers but that number seems a little low wasnt the waiver in the third quarter million at least that was what was in the q and so can you maybe help reconcile where youre currently running on waivers versus that million sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley absolutely so this million what were reflecting here brennan its a good question is the forward curve and so the forward curve has the first rate hike that we looked at from december so thats in the second quarter so therefore its the amount that you would expect to realize this year should that forward curve play out thats the way that this slide was illustrated and just to drive the distinction though between what you see in the q the q has all different types of waivers its not just money market waivers but youre right to say that this number on a relative basis would be considered low if youre thinking about a full year context brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay so we could calibrate both the nii number and the liquidity okay excellent and then when we think about you made a comment i think sharon when you were talking about the impact in the fourth quarter of wealth management margins clearly low right full year impact of that benefit but it sounded like what you said was when were thinking about entering that the full year is the way to think about it but thats just like i just wanted to sort of clarify to understand did you mean that that was the jumping off point or that thats the right way to think about in total because id assume with a lot of the rate benefit coming continued operating leverage and whatnot youd be talking more about a jumping off point than thinking about the full year but am i reading too much into that sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley no youre not thank you for clarifying that thats accurate what we were referring to is the first quarter of and using this full year number as a good launching off point of sort of setting you up thats obviously ex integration for the first quarter brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley so yes as rate rises that should increase the margin as it goes forward throughout the course of the year brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay okay hopefully i can sneak one in because it was a clarification question morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley sure go for it brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thank you the investment management fee rate was like really pleasantly surprisingly improved despite the fact that were still waiving fees like we just talked about could you talk a little about i know eaton vance is early and theres still that is still progressing and whatnot but i kind of thought that the third quarter fee rate would have settled fully but there was an improvement can you talk about what drove that improvement is that sustainable or was there some onetime lumpiness in there sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley its the fourth quarter you see some of the rates moving up in the fourth quarter brennan but overall i think as you look forward and you think about fees more broadly we obviously have a larger asset base i think it all ends back to this idea of growth and thats i think really ties to james slide as well which really thinks about what are we trying to build leaning into growth and really thinking about creating durable fee revenue streams over time brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc so when you say the fourth quarter i mean i was excluding the performance fee because you guys break that out are there performance fees that are also embedded in the asset management line too that have the seasonality james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley indiscernible sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley no brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc no okay so the core fee rate is a good fee rate to think about going forward sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley yes and we also disclose them in the q and in the k brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc excellent thanks for taking my questions appreciate it morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley of course operator the next question is from glenn schorr with evercore isi group glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hi thanks very much james a little tiny clarifier if i could last quarter i think you made the comment of well organic growth shouldnt be likely below today you said more like lumpy like the old days is it still like the old days meaning that when you were in that range pre all the additions and the opportunities you have in hand are we still looking at like should be and above i dont mean to pin you down i just want to make sure im getting the right context james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah i dont know what im not sure i heard you correctly about what you said about what i said last quarter but let me say what im going to say this quarter listen we historically back in the bad old days we actually had negative growth right we lost more money than we brought in then for a bunch of years through the early and sort of to we were probably running at the couple of years before the etrade acquisition and before frankly the business really hit its stride we were sort of running around and we kind of guided to was reasonable for long term projections this past year i think we grew at which is i mean its freakish right glenn youre talking about over billion of new money there are a lot of asset management companies that arent billion in size i dont think thats sustainable i mean god id love it but i dont think its sustainable but were not going back to i dont know if its somewhere in that zone but its going to be very healthy growth rate and you compound that out over what is now trillion you get to really big numbers which is why combined with wealth and asset management we put them together and currently theyre about trillion we can see a path to trillion here and we want to call that because we believe thats going to happen so were in that sort of i dont know and thats why i deliberately said in the script that it was too early to put a net new money target out there we needed to see where this really settled glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc perfect exactly what i needed thanks the other one james is the longterm goals if you look at the last slide i think those are great longterm goals and if you could do that sustainably i think you would get your multiple expansion people would love it james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 wed be a stock my friend glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc the highclass problem that you have is you kind of did some of them this year or last year so maybe again if i could just have you parse some words and just go through how to think about sustainability and what youre building towards what long term means just so we dont do the up and down game every quarter of sort of like oh wait you didnt hit your rotce target this quarter indiscernible james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah listen this is the problem with putting goals out there you hit them and everybody says great whats the new one our goals last year our twoyear goals were just take rotce of to we happened to hit this year it was an unbelievably good year and if we were really operating with a permanent 20plus percent rotce the stock would be much higher than it is now in fact i think it should be higher than it is now but thats a different issue so we put out 20plus i dont think youre going to find another bank in the world thats putting out a 20plus rotce goal and over long term were not saying forever thats why we separated client assets of trillion as longer term not to be too cute about it but we think that obviously just mathematically if you do net new money growth you have to market appreciation youre talking about a sort of just mathematically four year to fiveyear time zone to get to trillion by the way in our total assets as a company were trillion were now at trillion so its not like an impossible lift on efficiency ratio when i started in this job i think our efficiency ratio was in the low we have grounded down every single year and our range over the last including this year was to we obviously beat that as i said we had a blowout year but were consistently of the view that notwithstanding all the talk about expense pressure our efficiency ratio will stay under that for longterm management and managing growth and investing in the business youve got to balance growth versus expense i think thats a phenomenal outcome and wealth management our longterm goals there were to im sorry to weve now said 30plus when we get the kicker from the forward curve we get some of the rate increase next couple of years we finish the integration expenses youre going to see that number go up no question about that so thats the context and frankly i just like the round trillion felt like a nice clean sheet everybody can follow it and thats what were planning on glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc awesome thank you both operator the next question is from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning james good morning sharon morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley good morning sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley hi steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so i was hoping to unpack just some of the assumptions underpinning the margin target for the wealth segment looking at the adjusted wealth management margin this past year of the target is certainly significant improvement from where youve been run rating over like the past decadeplus in this new world order following the etrade acquisition it does feel a bit conservative when layering in the synergies as well as simply the realization of the forward curve and i wanted to see if we should expect the nii windfall to largely fall to the bottom line and can you speak to what you believe is an achievable margin goal when contemplating a lot of the tailwinds or benefits you cited from higher run rate organic growth the upside from higher rates and just the full realization of the etrade synergies james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley steve i have to say i love you youre the first person in history to call a 30plus pretax margin in wealth management as conservative i mean we started we were like so listen theres nobody in history i think has ever generated 30plus percent number i think it was back if you go back it was shearson in the fourth quarter of i believe generated a margin and that was because they were doing lets just say a lot of internet based buying and selling the clients back then so that was like an artificial period listen theres a reason we put the plus on it we dont think is the ceiling but lets run before we sprint here weve gone from to to to to margins with growth thats a phenomenal story if we can do which we will do because of the way rates are going it gets even better so 30plus theres no great magic to it its just the math of how we think the business plays out the next couple years i dont know what the plus is going to be it might be or it might be steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc fair enough james although last year i think you had a similar response when i pressed you on the rotce target and it was raised so hopefully well see a similar outcome this goround james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley maybe youre clairvoyant i dont know steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 well just for my followup i wanted to ask about the upcoming changes to the capital regime there are certainly some significant changes coming down the pike as part of basel iv i know we might be jumping the gun we dont have a proposal yet from the fed but i was hoping you could just share some preliminary thoughts on how you see this potentially impacting minimum capital requirements at the firm and any learnings just from the sa ccr experience in terms of your ability to mitigate some of those rwa inflationary pressures sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley sure why dont i take the last one first which i think the overarching theme is really around adaptation because it specifically relates to saccr i think there was data mitigation that we were able to achieve and i think were proud of being able to focus and move forward as it relates to basel no surprise that you asked the question steve so its nice to hear from you on that one but obviously theres no final rule yet i think the difficulty in saying something is that there is often and can be offsets between these rules and so thats something that i would bear in mind as you think through it and as we all think through it but what i think is really the point is that we have adopted really well and we also have basis points i think as james showed of excess capital on the cet1 metric and so i think were really comfortable with our position and were comfortable to better understand the capital rules as they come our way steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got it thanks so much for taking my questions james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley thank you operator the next question is from mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi since james youre looking for the rotce permanently how much longer do you plan to stay as ceo and by setting such a high target are you encouraging some extra risktaking james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley ill take the second part of the question first no we in fact did a rotce this year without taking extra risk taking with the movement in rates the scale in the business the completed integration to come of eaton vance and etrade and the removal of those costs the moats around the business and the embedded growth we have in net new assets i dont think these involve risktaking at all this is not about growing the balance sheet and growing riskweighted assets this is about growing durable fee sources durable revenues and managing our expenses i dont know if were going to achieve it every single year but were certainly its certainly a goal and its a goal for a reason so no i dont think it involves taking extra risk i mean fundamentally our business model is different mike as you know we generate billion and its going up from wealth and asset management that dont involve taking a lot of risk our investment bank traditional morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 investment banking doesnt involve taking a lot of risk some of the underwriting obviously does some of the trading does but a lot of the look at equities a lot of the equities business is buying and selling on behalf of the clients so no thats not the the plan is not after all these years to dial up the risk and im not going to repeat what ive said many times im not leaving now and im not going to be here in five years and its up to the board were developing successors ill be here a few years and i want to see these integrations done i want to see us firmly on this path and i want to hand it over to somebody else who can take us through the next decade mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc great and then one followup as far as the ins and outs thats helpful to get the market share and the numbers speak for themselves investment banking market share equity share but on the one hand i think youre one of the biggest providers to the tech industry and with tech having some pain recently what percent of your investment banking business is to the tech sector and then offsetting that perhaps theres some other industries that are coming back on line after the pandemic sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley sure i would actually point to the fact that what i said i think in the last two quarters is that were seeing a broadening out of the advisor activity its not specific to any one sector and i think thats been what really contributed to the healthy pipelines in that business across all the investment banking and then as you look in sales and trading its a highly diversified model and is not really pinned down to any one specific sector mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator the next question is from matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning can you just talk a bit big picture on the industry wallet for both banking and trading as rates rise and as the fed unwinds the balance sheet obviously theres been some benefits the last couple of years and were all trying to figure out do we anchor to the more recent last couple years go back to precovid as we think about the wallet and my followup will be on your positioning specifically thank you sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley sure i think the if you think about the industry wallet there has been a couple of things that i would mention one is obviously as i said if you look specifically at investment banking youve seen different types of activity you see different types of corporates and sponsors which has been one of the contributors of a bigger of a greater wallet but then if you also think about the sales and trading franchise and the movement there the activity has changed i think that you were looking back if you think back to pre2018 there was obviously less activity morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 with central banks all having a very similar approach and one rate obviously as you inject rates rising you do you would expect or one should expect different types of volatility and different diversification amongst products which could contribute to a bigger or a different type of wallet that you saw in the early to period that being said i mean obviously none of us have a crystal ball i think right now what we do know is that activity is high i think theres a lot of client differentiation and a robustness really in that type of wallet more broadly but well have to see how it goes and i think the point i was trying to make in my conclusion is we dont know how any of it will impact sentiment and i think thats the big piece that is out there as a factor that we have to watch matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc fair enough and then in terms of your positioning obviously slide of your deck shows very strong market share gains the last few years as you think about the market kind of ebbing and flowing is the goal to hold the share this kind of ties back into some of the expense pressures in the industry where some of your peers are either invested quite a bit this last year or plan to in the future years how do we think about the segments i mean you already have such strong share in equities for example but fixed income is an area where youve talked about being somewhere in between on the fly so how do you think about those businesses from a competitive point of view going forward thanks sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley so i think that when you what we would point to is i think this is a really its a scaledriven model weve put a lot of moats in place i think having a global reach across different pieces contributes to the ability to actually hold or gain share across the investment banking division or excuse me the institutional securities franchise more broadly if you think about the equities we have a very strong franchise there investment banking as ive said before we continue to invest in that business and then if you look at fixed income i think we continue to feel good about that business our client positioning and weve gained share over the last couple of years and we feel good about being rightsized and there for our clients as it relates to those needs matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful thank you operator the next question is from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i guess james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley good morning morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc sharon i was wondering if one we could just get a marktomarket in terms of an update on all the integration where we are and when do we expect to fully get that behind us and just tied to that i think james youve in the past talked about looking at etrade scaling that up globally just give us a sense of is that something that can happen in the near term and whats the optionality there on etrade in taking it global sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley so why dont i start on the integration i think where we what we had said was well look for approximately a threeyear integration period we have seen some and this is specific to etrade we have seen obviously a portion of the integrationrelated spend over the course of the last two years we would expect the vast majority of the integrationrelated expenses to be pulled forward into with a slight residual in but most of that happening in and i think that what youll see later in the space will be more on the back end and not really a client not really clientfacing as it relates to the actual cost synergies that weve seen were in a very good place i think that it exceeded our expectations in terms of the guidance that we gave in terms of a timeline and seeing those come through but on a holistic basis we stick to the cost synergy guidance that we gave when we first announced the transaction james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley on the international i mean etrade already manages some plans internationally we dont have immediate plans to take the platform outside the us but its certainly part of the longterm strategy so id say right now lets get the integration done lets prove out the case here get the cost synergies we talked about sort of close the books on that and then were looking for further expansion ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just a separate question around theres some concern that the fed is behind the curve in terms of monetary policy how concerned are you in terms of the risk of an accident happening with one of your clients within the capital markets business if the fed has to hike faster or get to qt sooner than expected any thoughts around that james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley weve got weve got a lot of clients so im sure some of them are well positioned for rate hikes some arent its very hard to predict the ph dot point suggests were going to get three to four rate hikes this year and three to four next year that feels kind of right that gets us back to sort of near normal normal would be about increases from here gets us to about if people arent positioned to manage getting back to normal then its kind of i mean its sort of their problem im not particularly worried about it to be honest and we dont try and predict how people are going to change their positioning with what is a fairly predictable set of outcomes which is we will have a normalization of interest rates at some point in the next couple of years morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator the next question is from jeremy sigee with bnp paribas jeremy sigee q analyst exane bnp paribas thanks very much i just wanted to ask a couple of followup questions theyre two related questions really about the wealth management growth because obviously thats just such a strong theme in what youre doing the first one is i think the new metric youre giving us now the retention of vested assets thats an interesting metric and a useful one could you talk about how youre driving that into how youre going to get that higher in terms of how youre approaching those clients and what products youre putting in front of them to drive that higher and the second question related are you seeing any crosssell or revenue synergy between your three wealth management channels advisory workplace selfdirected or is it still too early for that sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley sure so on the first on the new metric i think that the first driver youre going to see is a lot of the companion accounts right so weve talked about the fact that we would expect to give everybody on the us a companion account or at least be at by the end of this year and thats still on track and what that will allow for is as those assets from stock plans vest into a companion account you retain them in a morgan stanley selfdirected type of way and then you use this will lead to the second question that you asked and sort of tying it together products like leadiq or technology investments like ph project genome to better understand our clients and offer us the technology and that agility to give advisors and to provide the right advisors to the right workplace participants we are already doing that we are already have pilots in place where we are giving different workplace individuals advisors and so i would say that this the first step is really getting everybody a companion account and thats part of the integration process and then the second part is using technology to better match clients such that while they still get client choice were able to offer them the full advice network that morgan stanley has to offer jeremy sigee q analyst exane bnp paribas thats great thank you could i just ask an unrelated followup do you need to get the cet1 ratio down to support your rotce targets staying above sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley no this is a longerterm target i think you saw it even this year so i would just retort with look at this particular year and where we were in terms of our cet1 and obviously say we were able to do it given the market circumstance id say that over time however we continue to look at capital as we think about how do we best morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 use that capital for investment returning it to shareholders with dividends looking at buybacks and then other ways and uses of capital as we have over the course of the last decade jeremy sigee q analyst exane bnp paribas thats great thank you operator your next question is from dan fannon with jefferies daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning i was hoping you could discuss the profitability of the asset management business now that youve had several quarters of eaton vance and i know that deal wasnt costdriven but wondering if theres any additional synergies and as you think about money market fee waivers coming through as you mentioned earlier the incremental margin on that in the context of the overall profitability of that business sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley sure so i think that the fee waivers sort of speak for themselves and so i think that gives you a direct number on the etrade and eaton vance integration or excuse me the investment management and the eaton vance integration i think that the way to think about it is it wasnt ever a costsavings transaction the idea was always to marry the platforms and youve already begun to see that so if you think about the diversification of the product suite itself youre in a position where if you see flows in one business go down youve seen flows go up in other businesses and so thats giving you this ballast almost in that business specifically but in addition to that and i mentioned this in my prepared remarks if you look at the second thing that we had highlighted a lot when we purchased eaton vance was the different distribution networks so we have an international or morgan stanley msim had an international distribution capability that eaton vance didnt have so a product such as calvert where you have a cyclical tailwind in terms of and a secular tailwind in terms of people being interested in that sustainability space that is going to be sold using our international distribution channels beginning in the first half of this year i think that shows the progress and momentum that we have in place as youre marrying those two different sort of companies and theyre coming together as one daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks and one of the other attributes youve highlighted is the parametric opportunity within wealth i guess is it too early to talk about uptake of that some of the tax advantage strategies they offer in terms of your wealth clients sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley well parametric was already offered and very well received within the wealth management platform i think were looking for more ways to sell to offer that product i should say within different parts of the wealth management channel morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 19jan2022 daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc got it thank
