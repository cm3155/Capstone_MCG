morning everyone thanks for joining us i know you have a very very busy morning so we did our best to keep these earnings uncomplicated for you heading into we anticipate as everybody did a more volatile market and obviously we saw that in the first quarter the year started with rising inflationary pressures accelerated expectations for tightening of monetary policy and most notably and sadly the invasion of the ukraine morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 this backdrop injected significant uncertainty into the markets and further tested resiliency of our franchise against this quickly evolving market environment our diversified business model again generated high returns the firm produced revenues of billion and a rotce of im pleased to report that our first quarter results continued to exemplify morgan stanleys strength and affirm our longterm strategy first institutional securities delivered another very strong quarter with revenues of billion making it one of its highest performances ever compared to last years record first quarter we saw a different mix of businesses driving the strength of this segment while underwriting was muted advisory was a highlight equity and fixed income again delivered exceptional results particularly in asia and europe as we supported our global clients amid a turbulent backdrop global balanced institutional businesses are complex they require many years to build and an enormous amount invested in human capital the breadth and depth of our franchise today is a competitive differentiator wealth management showcased its resiliency in the quarter notwithstanding fluctuating market levels the business generated a margin of approximately excluding integrationrelated expenses etrade integration continues to go very well and given the current path were on a significant portion of the integration will be done by the end of this year by the end of we expect to no longer separate our integration expenses net new assets for the quarter were billion that included an asset acquisition nonetheless organic growth in our existing business remained very strong in a volatile market this is very affirming of the model further we saw our first rate hike of the year in the first quarter and with our strong and growing deposit base this will have a near immediate economic impact to our business and it supports our path to delivering the margins that we projected in excess of in investment management the increased diversification of the business supported results in a very choppy market feebased asset management revenues which were billion in the quarter have grown with the addition of parametric calvert and the broadening of our alts and fixed income platforms weve performed better with these franchises than we would have without it and it has brought much more balance to our asset management business and with respect to the eaton vance integration it progresses very smoothly as well the teams remain stable and culturally its a terrific fit our markets continue to evolve we remain confident about our position and the many opportunities ahead finally a brief word on the russian invasion of the ukraine in managing a global business particularly a marketsbased global business we must always remain vigilant about the potential for shocks or unexpected events obviously the invasion of the ukraine is one such event first of all and most importantly our hearts go out to the ukrainians and all those who have been impacted as it relates to the business apart from the volatility its created theres been very limited financial impact to morgan stanley a few years ago we decided to give up our banking license and we significantly scaled back operations in russia further as a result of these actions and the current war were not entering into any new business in the country and our activities are limited to helping global clients address and close out preexisting obligations im very proud of how our team has managed through a difficult market backdrop and going forward we continue to navigate the turbulent markets and broader geopolitical environment with confidence ill now turn the call over to sharon to discuss the quarter in greater detail and together well take your questions morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 sharon yeshaya chief financial officer morgan stanley thank you and good morning the firm produced revenues of billion in the first quarter representing the second highest quarter in our firms history excluding integrationrelated expenses our eps was and our rotce was the firms first quarter efficiency ratio excluding integrationrelated expenses was and reflects our expense discipline while continuing to invest in the businesses results of the first quarter illustrate resiliency and durability equity and fixed income supported our clients while navigating volatile markets wealth management proved resilient and investment management benefited from diversification now to the businesses institutional securities revenues of billion represented the third highest quarter on record results declined from the record set in the prior year this quarters performance again demonstrated the power of our global integrated investment bank with balance across businesses and a strong presence across geographies we remain a global diversified leader europe delivered its best quarter in over a decade while asia saw a second highest result with strengths in both equities and fixed income investment banking revenues were billion led by strength in advisory compared to the prior year revenues declined by advisory revenues were million almost double the prior years first quarter reflecting higher completed ma volumes equity underwriting revenues were million a meaningful decline from last years elevated results in line with market volumes heightened volatility led clients to delay issuance activity fixed income underwriting revenues were million down compared to the prior year as macroeconomic conditions contributed to lower bond issuances investment banking pipelines remain healthy across sectors and regions however the conversion from pipeline to realized will be largely dependent on market conditions going forward equity revenues were billion reflecting broadbased strength in performance against the backdrop of volatile markets we continue to be a global leader in this business cash revenues were solid with particular strength in europe consistent with market volumes by geography derivative revenues were robust and the business navigated the volatility well prime brokerage revenues were strong while intraquarter balances were impacted by uncertainty we saw balances rebound alongside markets fixed income revenues of billion were in line with the very strong prior year in the quarter commodities and macro particularly foreign exchange led the strength macro revenues increased meaningfully from the prior quarter clients remained engaged and the trading environment proved constructive micro results were strong but reflected lower revenues compared to the prior year commodities delivered a more diversified results with revenues notably higher than the previous first quarter benefiting from the heightened levels of activity turning to wealth management revenues were billion declines in dcp negatively impacted the revenues by approximately million excluding the impact related to dcp revenues increased versus the prior years first quarter results results underscore the resilience of the franchise the value offered to clients during uncertain times and the benefits of our scaled multichannel model morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 retail clients remained invested with allocations across asset classes consistent with last year pbt was billion and the margin was or excluding integrationrelated expenses these strong results should continue to be supported as we realize the benefits of rising rates asset management revenues were billion up versus last year benefiting from the growth in feebased assets this growth continues to reflect the investments we have made into the business over time and affirms our strategy is working net new assets were billion for the quarter nna was inclusive of an asset acquisition which i will touch on shortly absent this asset acquisition annualized growth was and despite the volatility net new assets were generated from all channels the advisorled channel benefited from an even split of existing and new clients as well as positive net recruiting feebased flows were also strong and inclusive of the asset acquisition were billion workplace continues to benefit from the establishment of companion accounts retention of assets also continued to rise as a result of incremental companion account adoption and the value of the platform in the quarter we added billion of retirement assets through an asset acquisition of an institutional retirement consultant we remain a platform of choice and this is the second institutional retirement plan to join us in the last nine months we continue to view these asset acquisitions as incremental opportunities to reach the expanded audience through education and financial wellness the acquired teams client base includes nearly million of plan participants transactional revenues were million excluding the impact of dcp which is reflected in this line revenues were strong although activity moderated from the prior year selfdirected daily average trades remained above million in the quarter over three times etrades preasset acquisition record we have also seen meaningful interest in our alternatives offering given our broadbased access to managers and their retailoriented products loan growth remained strong in the quarter with bank lending balances growing billion driven by securities based lending and mortgages we expect loan growth over the remainder of the year to be consistent with our prior guidance of approximately billion per quarter deposits increased billion in the quarter to billion the average rate on deposits declined to basis points we have completed the net runoff in wholesale deposits and do not anticipate further declines in deposit costs net interest income was billion excluding prepayment amortization nii increased from the prior year driven by loan growth back in january we indicated that the fourth quarter nii was a reasonable base to inform and that we would expect million of incremental nii on the back of rising rates due to the further moves in rate expectations since january we should see this benefit at least double if the forward curve and our modeled assumptions are realized over the remaining nine months of the year moving to investment management my remarks will refer to quarteroverquarter changes as the timing of the eaton vance acquisition makes the prior quarter a more relevant benchmark revenues were billion the sequential decline reflects the seasonally lower performance fees which are mostly recognized in the fourth quarter and a more challenging market environment morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 despite headwinds this business is benefiting from increased scale and a more diversified product offering total aum of trillion declined quarteroverquarter as a result of market declines and outflows longterm net outflows reflected approximately billion of institutional outflows in our solutions business including the expected redemption of a large asset manager who brought their equity trading implementation inhouse equity strategies saw a giveback of some of the prior years asset appreciation as the broader market experienced a rotation out of growth this was partially offset by its continued strong flows into parametric customized portfolios as well as our inflationrelated and interest ratesensitive products asset management and related fees decreased sequentially to billion on the back of the aforementioned seasonality and market volatility performancebased income and other revenues were a loss of million in the quarter driven by markdowns in one of the asia private equity funds declines in deferred compensation plan investments and negative marks associated with legacy international real estate investments away from these specific markdowns we saw broadbased gains across our alternatives platform reflecting the strength and diversity of the platform turning to the balance sheet total spot assets increased to trillion our standardized cet1 ratio sequentially declined and now stands at multiple factors contributed to this change standardized rwas increased as client activity returned after the more moderated levels at the end of and volatility increased oci related to our availableforsale securities portfolio reflected an increase of an unrealized loss of billion as a result of higher interest rates while this should earn back over time it impacted our cet1 ratio by basis points in the quarter we continue to return capital to our shareholders we are executing on our billion buyback authorization as we repurchased billion of stock in the quarter we remain in a strong capital position our tax rate was for the quarter the vast majority of sharebased award conversions takes place in the first quarter creating a tax benefit we continue to expect our full year tax rate will be in line with full year the first quarter again tested the resiliency of our franchise we are pleased with how our team navigated the volatile environment and stayed close to clients during times of uncertainty while the outlook for the remainder of the year is difficult to predict the second quarter has started constructively and clients remain engaged with that we will now open up the line to questions morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 question and answer section operator we are now ready to take questions operator instructions the first question is from glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thank you maybe just to start off big picture so putting up a rotce in this tape im sure it is good performance and it is affirmation of the strategy and what you built so my question is you have enough capital you have a lot of earnings power rates are going up im curious how you think about is there whats next i mean what do you do with this higher earnings production with all the capital thats being produced do you continue to chip away and find bolton acquisitions are you thinking about a next act i mean organic growth alone can power this but im just curious in the next couple of years how youre thinking about that james james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley glenn its a highclass problem and its great position to be in weve been very protective of keeping a sort of buffer on a buffer because you never know in this world and i think what weve experienced with the markets in the last quarter were extremely volatile and you just have to you have to anticipate the worst and make sure youre prepared for that we clearly have done that weve been chipping away at the excess capital if you add back the oci were running about cet1 we were well above so clearly well see where our ccar results are i think last year theyre around or id be surprised if theres material changes but lets see so were still sitting on a significant buffer listen were clearly going to keep pushing capital distribution through buyback and dividend to shareholders thats clearly the case weve just done two major acquisitions with about billion we would do more deals if they fit with our strategy we wont do things that take us offline off piece we want to stay true to our strategy and our strengths in our three core businesses so yeah continued buyback but also a lot of investment in the business i mean were doing a lot on the tech side obviously we want to stay completely compliant with our regulatory responsibilities and well continue to invest to make sure were bestinclass there but a lot of investment technology and a lot of investment around the retirement workplace platform which i think is sort of the next frontier and were just in baby steps were very early days of that but i think thats a huge opportunity and finally i do think that there are opportunities outside of the us even though were along the us and that served us incredibly well and i think will serve us very well for the next decade but i think in the wealth and asset management spaces internationally we punch below our waist on institutional securities we dont and we had a very strong quarter in europe and asia in institutional securities but i think theres clearly more we can do internationally so sort of watch that space glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay i appreciate all of that thank you maybe just one followup sharon you mentioned alternatives on the wealth management platform i think youre the largest in the world but yet its still in terms of distributor of morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 alternative product but its still at a low level percentagewise of client assets so im curious james mentioned building technology building people how much do you have to prepare the platform or is it there waiting for this deluge of products thats coming im trying to get a window into whats coming in terms of alternative distribution on your platform sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley i think its a great question and as you said we continue to invest in it weve obviously seen the alternative players creating more product and you see that from peers but you also even see that from our own from msim as a secular growth trend in a place that were investing theyve obviously created products now that are more appropriate or more suitable for retail and our platform is there were working very closely together theres clearly more that we can do as james said were continuing to invest but i agree with you that this is a place where weve seen an uptick we noted it over the course of this quarter it was interesting to us as i know weve discussed it individually as well glenn and i think its a place where youll just continue to see that kind of growth investment from both us and also on the product side operator thank you our next question is from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay good morning thanks for taking my question sorry the desk is covered in paper couldnt even find the handset so i had a question first on the wealth management deposits and thanks sharon for that indication of updating the nii outlook but when we think about the deposits and the potential beta whats your expectation for beta this time around and what percentage of your deposits are actually on the selfdirected platform we get the asset percentages but its my sense that selfdirected runs with a higher percentage of cash so im guessing the percentage of deposits would skew higher than the assets do on that platform and could that impact your beta this time around thanks sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley sure i think its a great question i think about it as two parts probably actually a bit separately one with beta beta for us is informed by the last rate hike cycle so weve given you historically and we stand by at sort of a beta as an end state but obviously beta also moves through time as you see different rate cycles and so thats stage sort of point a if you think about just where the beta is your point on deposits is also interesting i think that we think about deposits as we look at the composition of the deposits and obviously what etrade did and the selfdirected channel did is it offered us more deposits from smaller accounts with smaller levels and that might to your point that might have a different beta so theres a beta obviously holistically but then theres a beta as youve mentioned that might depend on where you are within the size of the accounts and the stickiness that you might see associated with those deposits so were looking at it from two ways overall beta the same but the deposits themselves and the way that we think about the runoff of the deposits might be different this time around just given our own composition of the deposits as theyve been acquired by etrade morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great that makes a lot of sense and then for the followup sticking with the rate sensitivity sbl growth has been quite remarkable for the past many years when we think about what happened last rate hiking cycle i went back and i looked through and the interesting thing is the sbls werent often thought of as rate sensitive but they continued to grow in the last rate hiking cycle so how do you think about this time around the product is obviously mature but more mature and so maybe could be more subject to some rate sensitivity but also like advisors and customers probably understand the value of the product better too and so theres a couple of crosscurrents and i cant quite get my head around exactly how to think about it what are your thoughts on that sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley thanks for the question i think when you your points are i think appropriate youre looking at obviously yes it was nascent what id say about our profile is we didnt have the same size of household penetration across lending products then and even today there is still id say room to run in better understanding educating products and educating our clients about the different products that are available to them now of course the pace may change and thats not impossible given what were seeing or what you might think could happen thats not really the prediction but the idea is theres still more education that can be done and thats why i think we feel comfortable that even though we might see rates rise the actual amount that we gave you as guidance from a lending perspective should continue part of that obviously being sbl part of that being mortgages but when you look at the household penetration even five six years ago you were in very lowdouble digits for us and youve only reached that midteen numbers so still a lot more to go as i said around the education of that product for clients where thats suitable operator thank you our next question is from dan fannon with jefferies daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning the billion acquisition of aum that you got within wealth management this is the second transaction i think over the last months can you talk about the capabilities that youre getting with this and how this is being integrated more broadly into the wealth platform and also just thinking about the backdrop and strategy should we see more of these type of transactions going forward sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley so why dont i start with just saying well see more when its appropriate for our were obviously continuing to look at this space what these are and as james said when were looking at retirement were looking at defined benefit were looking at understanding how workplace coincides with the fa advisorled space together and the way that i would think of this is just an extension of our strategy so the best kind of concept that you can say is yes we had a proof point in the third quarter of last year were obviously in a situation where weve acquired a similar plan and group of advisors the group of advisors cover defined benefit contribution plans those defined benefit contribution plans have corporations associated with them that may also have participants in this case we have a million participants that were added morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 those participants if you go back to our strategy of the funnel theyre a top portion of that funnel that we begin to advise or educate or learn or teach people about financial wellness we give them access to our services particularly weve already developed in the workplace channel and so that educational content has a crossover and then they now understand better what financial wellness is they can say im interested in speaking to a financial advisor so thats where the channels begin to converge and merge and where youre beginning to really think about the top of the funnel into potentially providing access and advice to clients over time daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc got it that makes sense and you did talk about within the workplace higher retention rates and more companion accounts i dont know if you can give some stats around that but maybe youve also i think highlighted that the integration costs will be done with etrade by the end of the year so maybe whats left in terms of milestones with that and then within the kind of workplace some of the momentum and progress any numbers would be helpful thank you sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley sure so the companion accounts what weve said is that by the end of this year approximately of us stock participants will be in a position to access a companion account do they want to or should they have the stock to invest into the account so thats the point there the question around the retention of assets we had given that metric at the beginning of in the january deck and we talked about aiming towards and we have made improvements from the that we gave you at the end of the quarter so all of those are milestones as you think about integration and integrationrelated expenses and also the points that james had made around the investment in our business in technology and in the integration more broadly operator thank you our next question is from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so i wanted to start off with a question on nna outlook organic growth has moderated granted versus what admittedly was a neckbreaking pace that we had seen last year and to what extent does the market volatility disrupt advisor movement across the wealth space and have you seen any improvement in breakaway broker trends or just the recruiting backlog more broadly as volatility has started to moderate versus the level seen in jan and feb sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley thanks for the question steve so as it relates to net recruiting still seeing inflows on the back of net recruiting in fact all three channels as you think about nna were contributors to the nna number excluding the asset retention so if you just take that other piece or the asset acquisition and if you look just at the advisorled channel a couple of factors so one net recruiting positive two on the actual advisor side evenly split between existing accounts or existing clients and new clients so continuing to see consolidation of assets held away as well as new client relationships going forward and then we had a contribution from workplace which is obviously impacted by both the companion accounts and also retention of assets and selfdirected so really broadbased contributions from the different channels and net recruiting as i said remains very in a good in a solid place morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc understood and just for a followup just trying to clarify some of the nii guidance i was hoping you could provide sharon an update on the loan growth outlook whether youre still comfortable with the midteens loan growth you had guided to previously and does the more than billion nii benefit that you alluded to in your prepared remarks contemplate some continued loan growth or is that on a static balance sheet sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley its the same loan growth number that i gave you so the percent that you gave if you take that and you think it was basically about billion a quarter so we just gave you in dollars this time around so its the same that i gave in january and then that is whats the point around the i dont know if it was illusion i actually gave you that it was double so i said at least double in terms of the nii guidance increase that really has to do with the realization of the forward curve and the change in the forward curve operator thank you our next question is from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning just a quick couple of followups one sharon if you could remind us in terms of the nii guide how big is the money market waivers kind of coming back now that weve had the first fed hike and is there any additional improvement that we should expect if the fed hikes by bps in may sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley so our money market guidance we gave you was about plus million and we stand by plus million but id say its for the full year its really based on two factors that are contributing to that one is the balances as well as the industry and the waivers how quickly those waivers roll off so were million for the remainder of the year for the increase for investment management ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood and just as a followup when you think about its a tougher question around the macro outlook when we think about ma ipos coming back any sense in terms of when you look at the world feels like volatility is going to be high which bodes well for trading but how do you handicap just talking to sort of your corporate clients around appetite for deal making and given just the current geopolitical backdrop any color would be helpful sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah so a couple of things first on the advisory pipeline in particular pipeline remains healthy and diversified so taking a look at the underlying pipeline still diversified across sectors which i think is another healthy sign in terms of the marketplace as it relates to the underwriting calendar that obviously you do have deals that didnt necessarily come to market in the first quarter that pipeline to realize that was associated really with the volatility and the uncertainty in the first quarter as that recedes to the extent that it does that would move things from the pipeline state to the realized state morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 operator thank you our next question is from mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i have a question then a followup i guess no good deed goes unpunished going back to you said core net new asset growth for the quarter was if i got that right excluding the deal and so that is down from where you were before but its certainly up from where you guys had been a few years ago so where do you expect that to settle out and whats the relative contribution say etrade versus the other legacy businesses sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley weve given what i think we where we started mike is we said and james said it in january which we saw last year was exceptional and we didnt expect that to be repeated in the near term or we werent sure and we wanted to see how the pipeline moved out and how these different channels work together but what we did say is to is where we used to be and we werent expecting to see that obviously were also at a higher base now and so thats also something to bear in mind so i think we feel very good about where we are and this is well within that range that we had basically given you we said we would spend time better understanding the channels to provide guidance over time you asked another the contribution from each of the channels as i said three different channels all contributed very very nicely we dont break it out into different pieces but i would say that the integration is going well and the etrade client and client usage is also doing well mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and my followup question is on the block trading investigation which you guys highlighted in your filings and i know youre limited about what you want to say i know you cant and shouldnt give any expectations but there might be some things that you could disclose around this this might wind up being a nonevent i mean theres investigations all the time we get it but every now and then one of these investigations leads to something im not saying that this is the case but i just want to when investors ask me what do you think the impact of the block trading investigation of morgan stanley could be itd be nice for me and investors to have that answer so with that big wind up how much do you make from block trading per year and were these issues selfdisclosed by morgan stanley to the regulators or did it come from an outside party thank you james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley hey mike certainly preferred your first question about the net new money growth and highclass problems of not achieving organic is generating something like billion to billion net a year so its actually a great problem and i think as sharon said the various channels there are going to continue to contribute my telling you all of this is to say i cant talk about ongoing investigations of block trades obviously and were not going to do that on an earnings call but you can look at our equities business and how it performs generally and how it has done over many many years and its current performance and draw whatever conclusions might be appropriate but right now we cant talk about ongoing investigations and it doesnt matter whether its this one or any other one from any authority its always the same rule morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 operator thank you our next question is from gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi sharon sharon can you share with us when you take a look at the equities business as well as the ficc business and all the disruption we saw in the quarter has there been any opportunity for you guys to grab market share from maybe some other competitors that are weaker and are unable to handle the volatility the way you guys did sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley thanks gerard for the question actually i know a lot of the peers have released this morning so i havent looked specifically at this quarters number in terms of the public market share but what i can tell you is that we have seen increased share over time i think were really proud of the positions that weve made in both of the sales and trading franchises a lot of that has to do with what james discussed more directly in his script which is building these investing our people and talent both geographically and also making sure that we have it across different functions so all of these things are important i think its decades in the making rather than just one quarter and were really proud of the way that we thought about the continuous velocity of all of our resources to make sure that we can better and more efficiently support client flows gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and then a second following up on your commentary about your pipeline and we all understand the volatility of whats going on out there if the markets settle down but they settle down at lower valuations in the underwriting area do you still think that could come back or do we need higher valuations so that theres not basically down almost like a down round where private has to go public if thats their intention at a lower price than what theyve raised money at on the private side sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley i think that will be very i think individual companies will make their own decisions in terms of where they have that from an advicedriven perspective james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i just if you look at pipeline and you look at investment banking revenue through cycles its actually remarkably stable on an annual basis on a quarterly basis its extremely volatile i mean look at the change between fourth quarter ecm and first quarter ecm but then look at what ma did the advisory business i think over million but if you go through the end of the year im sure youll find its much more stable and reflective of what weve done in period so i dont think that its a very interesting question you raised but i dont think that individual companies they dont make their decisions obviously based on averages of what the market is they make them based on what their own equity capital needs are or debt capital needs or ma needs and listen weve got we have one of the best franchises in the world it is global so any crossborder deals any global companies were in it that wont change its just a question is it  or  so im really unphased by the volatility in banking on a quarterly basis morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 operator thank you our next question is from jeremy sigee with bnp paribas jeremy sigee q analyst exane bnp paribas hi there thank you i wanted to talk about the lower transaction revenues in wealth management and not so much about what happened in the quarter but just looking at march and april whats the state of mind in your wealth management clients is this an environment where theyre going to stay active or become more active again or is this a sort of waitandsee kind of mood among your clients sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley so actually its an interesting question two things that struck me as we sort of went through and thought about the quarter one is the fact that when you look at allocations of investors in the retail space in terms of where their positions were in equities fixed income cash cash equivalents et cetera on a proportional basis over the last year or two actually those percentages have actually also remained relatively stable so the retail investors investment is something that hasnt necessarily fluctuated based on the data that we have that weve seen those positions have remained there despite the fact that theres been volatility the second point is specifically on selfdirected is the etrade the fact that this is what i tried to mention in the script was where we are from the daily average trade levels still very very high three times the high from when etrade was a standalone company and so i think it highlights the change that weve seen in the retail sentiment over the course of the last two or three years james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley id just add two points to that number one the transaction revenue line in wealth management has the dcp impact in it which was actually very big this quarter that bounces around and secondly if you look at the pl of wealth management actually the transaction revenues as a driver of the overall health of the business is relatively small i mean the much more important are the feebased revenues the net interest income what were doing in the banking side so and then some of the new issue stuff so i just put that out there again its one of these things that honestly im not very pleased im much more interested in asset growth net new asset growth and what were doing in the bank than deposits transactions will bounce around given market volatility jeremy sigee q analyst exane bnp paribas thats very helpful thank you could i just ask a followup im sitting in europe you mentioned europe was strong could you talk about which bits were driving that what was so great in europe this quarter sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley i think that this is really based on the advicedriven model right do you have uncertainty in europe theres a lot going on obviously there are pieces of commodities for example its very specific but then you also just see client engagement as it relates to various parts of europe and being able to service that advice is all part of this diversified model operator thank you our next question is from devin ryan with jmp securities morgan stanley ms corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2022 devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc great good morning everyone question on the family office strategy there was an interesting article recently and i figured to dig in here a little bit more i know its always been a focus for morgan stanley and really the firm is uniquely positioned in my opinion to really take advantage of that but im curious kind of what is new in the strategy and how you guys would maybe frame the evolution and kind of where the opportunity is accelerating sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley absolutely im actually glad you asked the question i think its a really interesting space and i think its an example of connecting the dots so over the course of the last couple of years what weve realized is theres a need for family offices to have access to services that we already offer institutional securities clients through our fund services platform and so bringing together those conversations between whats happening in the institutional securities group and what strategy were driving in wealth management is just an example of how the business is working more closely together to find those opportunities to service clients as family offices begin to feel more like institutional accounts and that back and forth in dialogue is really amongst the team the leadership and then throughout the organization devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay great thanks sharon quick followup just on the digital asset strategy and maybe how you would frame where you are today both in gwm and institutional and what we could expect over the next year sharon
