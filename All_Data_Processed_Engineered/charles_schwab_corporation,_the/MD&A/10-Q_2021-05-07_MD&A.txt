sheet assets were billion at the end of the first quarter of up from yearend and our tier leverage ratio increased to integration of td ameritrade against a backdrop of unprecedented client activity and volume growth in the first quarter of the company continued its integration of td ameritrade as a result of the significant growth seen in recent quarters across key client volume metrics including the number of active brokerage accounts dats and peak daily trades the company is expanding the scope of technology work related to the integration we anticipate greater technology buildout to support the expanded volumes of our combined client base based on our revised integration plans and expanded scope of technology work the company expects to complete client conversion within to months from the date of acquisition and we expect to incur total acquisition and integrationrelated costs and capital expenditures of between billion and billion the companys estimates of the nature amounts and timing of recognition of acquisition and integrationrelated costs remain subject to change based on a number of factors including the expected duration and complexity of the integration process and the heightened uncertainty of the current economic environment more specifically factors that could cause variability in our expected acquisition and integrationrelated costs include the level of employee attrition workforce redeployment from eliminated positions into open roles changes in the levels of client activity as well as increased real estaterelated exit cost variability due to effects of the covid19 pandemic over the course of the integration we continue to expect to realize annualized cost synergies of between billion and billion with onequarter to onethird on an

variety of risks including operational compliance credit market and liquidity risks the company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact as part of our integration of td ameritrade the company is aligning td ameritrades historical risk exposures with schwabs risk appetite our integration work includes evaluating new or changed risks impacting the combined company and may involve modifications to our existing risk management processes though integration work continues the companys operations inclusive of td ameritrade remain consistent with our enterprise risk management erm framework for a discussion of our risk management programs see item risk management in the form 10k interest rate risk simulations net interest revenue simulation for our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulations include all balance sheet interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments repricing of financial instruments and reinvestment of matured or paiddown securities and loans net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets include investment securities margin loans and bank loans these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans and control the composition of our investment securities we have some ability to manage our net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted the following table shows the simulated change to net interest revenue over the next months beginning march and december of a gradual basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period march december increase of basis points decrease of basis points net interest revenue sensitivities as of march remained relatively consistent with december due to the continued low interest rate environment higher shortterm interest rates would positively impact net interest revenue as yields on interestearning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources a decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the companys investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources compressing net interest margin in addition to measuring the effect of a gradual basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel and nonparallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue bank deposit account fees simulation consistent with the presentation on the consolidated statement of income the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the net interest revenue simulation described above as of march simulated changes in bank deposit account fee revenue from gradual basis point changes in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates did not have a significant impact on the companys total net revenues economic value of equity simulation management also uses economic value of equity eve simulations to measure interest rate risk eve sensitivity measures the longterm impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment key assumptions in our eve calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments term structure models of interest rates nonmaturity deposit behavior and pricing assumptions our net interest revenue bank deposit account fee revenue and eve simulations reflect the assumption of nonnegative investment yields phaseout of libor the company has established a firmwide team to address the phasingout of libor as part of our efforts we have assessed our libor exposures the largest of which are certain investment securities and loans in purchasing new investment securities we ensure that appropriate fallback language is in the securitys prospectus in the event that libor is unavailable or deemed unreliable and we have sold certain securities lacking appropriate fallback language we are updating loan agreements to ensure new liborbased loans

nongaap financial measures in addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with gaap managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain references to the nongaap financial measures described below we believe these nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information about the financial performance of the company and facilitate meaningful comparison of schwabs results in the current period to both historic and future results these nongaap measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to nongaap financial measures presented by other companies schwabs use of nongaap measures is reflective of certain adjustments made to gaap financial measures as described below nongaap adjustment or measure definition usefulness to investors and uses by management acquisition and integrationrelated costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets schwab adjusts certain gaap financial measures to exclude the impact of acquisition and integrationrelated costs incurred as a result of the companys acquisitions amortization of acquired intangible assets and where applicable the income tax effect of these expenses adjustments made to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets are reflective of all acquired intangible assets which were recorded as part of purchase accounting these acquired intangible assets contribute to the companys revenue generation amortization of acquired intangible assets will continue in future periods over their remaining useful lives we exclude acquisition and integrationrelated costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets for the purpose of calculating certain nongaap measures because we believe doing so provides additional transparency of schwabs ongoing operations and is useful in both evaluating the operating performance of the business and facilitating comparison of results with prior and future periods acquisition and integrationrelated costs fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and integration activities thereby limiting comparability of results among periods and are not representative of the costs of running the companys ongoing business amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of the companys underlying operating performance return on tangible common equity return on tangible common equity represents annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity tangible common equity represents common equity less goodwill acquired intangible assets net and related deferred tax liabilities acquisitions typically result in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and acquired intangible assets we believe return on tangible common equity may be useful to investors as a supplemental measure to facilitate assessing capital efficiency and returns relative to the composition of schwabs balance sheet beginning in the company also uses adjusted diluted eps and return on tangible common equity as components of performance criteria for employee bonus and certain executive management incentive compensation arrangements the compensation committee of cscs board of directors maintains discretion
