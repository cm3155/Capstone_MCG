twice for a total of basis points to near zero on the longerend of the curve the 10year treasury rate declined by over basis points the changes in the economic environment in the first quarter of

interestearning assets for the first quarter of were higher by compared to the same period in the increase in average interestearning assets for the first quarter of was primarily driven by higher client cash balances in bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients our net interest margin was during the first quarter of down from a year earlier this decrease was driven primarily by lower yields received on interestearning assets due largely to the federal reserves and interest rate decreases we expect some net interest margin compression in coming quarters largely due to the impact of lower interest rates across maturities at the same time higher balances of cash and other interestearning assets can be additive to net interest revenue the amount of net interest margin compression

risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact for a discussion of our risk management programs see item risk management in the form 10k net interest revenue simulation for our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulations include all interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments repricing of financial instruments and reinvestment of matured or paiddown securities and loans net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets primarily include investment securities margin loans and bank loans these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans and control the composition of our investment securities we have some ability to manage our net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the simulated net interest revenue change over the next months beginning march and december of a gradual basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period march december increase of basis points decrease of basis points the change in net interest revenue sensitivities as of march reflects a significantly lower interest rate curve from the fourth quarter of due to the global economic impact from the covid19 pandemic higher shortterm interest rates would the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted positively impact net interest revenue as yields on interest earning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources a decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the companys investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources compressing net interest margin in addition to measuring the effect of a gradual basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel and nonparallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue economic value of equity simulation management also uses economic value of equity eve simulations to measure interest rate risk eve sensitivity measures the longterm impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment key assumptions in our eve calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments term structure models of interest rates nonmaturity deposit behavior and pricing assumptions as a result of the low interest rate environment in the first quarter of the downward assessments of our net interest revenue and eve simulations as of march reflected the assumption of nonnegative investment yields expected phaseout of libor the company has established a firmwide team to address the likely discontinuation of libor as part of our efforts we have inventoried our libor exposures the largest of which are certain investment securities and loans in purchasing new investment securities we ensure that appropriate fallback language is in the securitys prospectus in the event that libor is unavailable or deemed unreliable we are updating loan agreements to ensure new liborbased loans adequately provide for an alternative to libor furthermore we plan to phaseout the use of libor as a reference rate in our new lending products before december consistent with our through clients eyes strategy our focus
