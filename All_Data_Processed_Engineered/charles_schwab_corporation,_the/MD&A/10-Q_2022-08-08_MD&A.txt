integrationrelated costs remain subject to change based on a number of factors including the expected duration and complexity of the integration process and the continued uncertainty of the economic

the time of origination or purchase changes in interest rates on floatingrate securities and loans and changes in prepayment levels for mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities and loans interest rates increased significantly from yearend through june shortterm rates were near zero until the federal reserve began its tightening cycle in march ultimately increasing the federal funds target overnight rate three times between march and june for a total increase of basis points while longterm interest rates increased throughout the first six months of the year despite significant seasonal taxrelated client cash outflows in the second quarter schwab continued to see strength in net new client assets throughout the first six months of which along with transfers of bda balances to the companys balance sheet see bank deposit account fees drove growth in schwabs interestearning assets partially offsetting this growth sustained equity market volatility and softening investor sentiment during the second quarter and the first six months of reduced demand for margin loans which declined from yearend in addition over recent quarters the company has increased its cash holdings and reduced the duration of incremental investment securities purchases to provide flexibility to support changes in client cash allocations associated with higher shortterm interest rates these steps also help keep schwab positioned to benefit from interest rate increases the following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interestearning assets and funding sources on

occupancy and equipment expenses increased in both segments primarily due to an increase in software maintenance and other agreements as well as other technology equipment costs to support growth of the business and the integration of td ameritrade in addition depreciation and amortization increased for both segments primarily due to higher amortization of purchased and internally developed software and higher depreciation of hardware along with increases to enhance our technological infrastructure to support growth of the business for investor services these increases were more than offset by lower other expenses due to a charge of approximately million in the second quarter of for a regulatory matter see item note resulting in a slight decrease in total expenses excluding interest in the second quarter and first six months of compared to the same periods in risk management schwabs business activities expose it to a variety of risks including operational compliance credit market and liquidity risks the company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact as part of our ongoing integration of td ameritrade the company has aligned td ameritrades risk management practices with schwabs risk appetite our integration work included evaluating new or changed risks impacting the combined company the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted and taking action through various means though integration work continues the companys operations inclusive of td ameritrade remain consistent with our enterprise risk management erm framework for a discussion of our risk management programs see part ii item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management in the form 10k interest rate risk simulations net interest revenue simulation for our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulations include all balance sheet interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments repricing of financial instruments and reinvestment of matured or paiddown securities and loans net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets include investment securities margin loans bank loans and cash and cash equivalents these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans and control the composition of our investment securities we have some ability to manage our net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the simulated change to net interest revenue over the next months beginning june and december of a gradual basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period june december increase of basis points decrease of basis points the companys simulated increase of basis points in market interest rates had a lower impact on net interest revenue as of june compared to december primarily due to increased sensitivity to the companys higher projected client deposit rates and decreased sensitivity to the companys mortgagebacked investment securities a simulated decrease of basis points in market interest rates had a larger impact on net interest revenue as of june compared to december primarily due to increased sensitivity of cash and shortterm investments this increased sensitivity was partially offset by higher starting client deposit rates which relative to the december simulation provide greater responsiveness to lower simulated interest rates higher shortterm interest rates would positively impact net interest revenue as yields on interestearning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources a decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the companys investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources compressing net interest margin in addition to measuring the effect of a gradual basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel and nonparallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted bank deposit account fees simulation consistent with the presentation on the consolidated statement of income the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the net interest revenue simulation described above as of june and december simulated changes in bank deposit account fee revenue from gradual basis point changes in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates did not have a significant impact on the companys total net revenues economic value of equity simulation management also uses economic value of equity eve simulations to measure interest rate risk eve sensitivity measures the longterm impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment key assumptions in our eve calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments term structure models of interest rates nonmaturity deposit behavior and pricing assumptions our net interest revenue bank deposit account fee revenue and eve simulations reflect the assumption of nonnegative investment yields phaseout of libor the company has made significant progress to prepare for the phasingout of libor as described in part ii item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management in the form 10k and additional transition efforts to prepare for the phasingout of libor are ongoing on march president biden signed the consolidated appropriations act of into law which includes the adjustable interest rate libor act containing legislation related to the transition away from libor this legislation is intended to establish a uniform process for replacing libor in existing contracts and securities that continue after the cessation of libor and do not contain clearly defined or practicable fallback provisions on july the federal reserve board released a proposal that provides default rules for certain contracts that use libor which would implement the libor act with replacement rates based on the secured overnight financing rate sofr the company believes the libor act and the federal reserve boards proposed regulation help provide clarity for the transition of our legacy libor contracts including investment securities loans and preferred stock to alternative reference rates in an orderly manner liquidity risk liquidity risk is the potential that schwab will

critical accounting estimates certain of our accounting policies that involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity are discussed in part ii item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates in the form 10k there have been no changes to critical accounting estimates during the first six months of nongaap financial measures in addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain references to the nongaap financial measures described below we believe these nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information about the financial performance of the company and facilitate meaningful comparison of schwabs results in the current period to both historic and future results these nongaap measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to nongaap financial measures presented by other companies schwabs use of nongaap measures is reflective of certain adjustments made to gaap financial measures as described below nongaap adjustment or measure definition usefulness to investors and uses by management acquisition and integrationrelated costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets schwab adjusts certain gaap financial measures to exclude the impact of acquisition and integrationrelated costs incurred as a result of the companys acquisitions amortization of acquired intangible assets and where applicable the income tax effect of these expenses adjustments made to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets are reflective of all acquired intangible assets which were recorded as part of purchase accounting these acquired intangible assets contribute to the companys revenue generation amortization of acquired intangible assets will continue in future periods over their remaining useful lives we exclude acquisition and integrationrelated costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets for the purpose of calculating certain nongaap measures because we believe doing so provides additional transparency of schwabs ongoing operations and is useful in both evaluating the operating performance of the business and facilitating comparison of results with prior and future periods acquisition and integrationrelated costs fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and integration activities thereby limiting comparability of results among periods and are not representative of the costs of running the companys ongoing business amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of the companys underlying operating performance return on tangible common equity return on tangible common equity represents annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity tangible common equity represents common equity less goodwill acquired intangible assets net and related deferred tax liabilities acquisitions typically result in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and acquired intangible assets we believe return on tangible common equity may be useful to investors as a supplemental measure to facilitate assessing capital efficiency and returns relative to the composition of schwabs balance sheet the company also uses adjusted diluted eps and return on tangible common equity as components of performance criteria for employee bonus and certain executive management incentive compensation arrangements the compensation committee of cscs board of
