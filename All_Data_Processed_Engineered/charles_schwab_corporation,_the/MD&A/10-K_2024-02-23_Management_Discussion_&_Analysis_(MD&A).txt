trillion in client assets across more than million client accounts including rias from td ameritrade to the schwab platform across four transition groups the company has now completed the transition of rias and approximately of all td ameritrade client accounts in connection with the completed transitions we have experienced some dealrelated attrition of client assets from retail accounts and rias which have been below our initial estimates when we announced the acquisition the company expects to complete the remaining client transitions from td ameritrade to schwab in a final transition group in may the company continues to expect total acquisition and integrationrelated costs and capital expenditures will be between billion and billion the companys estimates of the nature amounts and timing of recognition of acquisition and integrationrelated costs remain subject to change based on certain factors including the duration and complexity of the remaining integration process and the continued uncertainty of the economic environment more specifically factors that could cause variability in our expected acquisition and integrationrelated costs as we prepare for the last

fiduciary regulation for brokerdealers the us department of labor released another proposed rule to significantly broaden the definition of fiduciary under the employee retirement income security act of among other requirements the rule would subject brokerdealers who provide nondiscretionary investment advice to retirement plans and accounts to a best interest standard the rule could significantly impact the products services and support that firms can make available to retirement investors and the company continues to evaluate such impacts and the related implementation and operational issues pending final adoption in october the us federal banking agencies issued a final rule that makes extensive revisions to the regulations implementing the cra these revisions include the delineation of assessment areas the overall evaluation framework and performance standards and metrics the definition of community development activities and data collection and reporting and requires significant new lending by banks to lowandmoderate income communities the new rule generally becomes effective on january with its additional data collection and reporting requirements effective january the company has begun to prepare for complying with the requirements included in the new rule by the applicable effective dates we do not expect the new rule will have a material impact on the companys business financial condition or results of operations in august the us federal banking agencies issued a proposed rulemaking on longterm debt requirements for certain large banking organizations among other things the proposed rule would require csc to maintain outstanding minimum levels of eligible longterm debt as defined by the proposed rule issued externally the proposed rule would also require our banking subsidiaries to maintain outstanding minimum levels of eligible longterm debt which our banking subsidiaries would be required to issue internally to csc the proposed rule would be phasedin over a threeyear transition period the comment period for the proposed rule ended on january and the rule proposal is subject to further modification the proposed rule could have a significant impact on the amount of debt that csc and our banking subsidiaries are required to maintain in july the us federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking with amendments to the regulatory capital rules among other things the proposed rules would require us to include aoci in regulatory capital and to calculate our riskweighted assets using a revised riskbased approach a component of which is based on operational risk phased in over a threeyear transition period beginning july and ending july the comment period for the proposed rules ended on january the impact of the proposal would be significant to schwab as the proposed rules could increase regulatory capital requirements for consolidated csc and our banking subsidiaries in anticipation of the rules being adopted the companys capital management for consolidated csc and our banking subsidiaries now incorporates measures that are inclusive of aoci see capital management for additional information in december the sec proposed a set of four related equity market structure rules that would make significant changes to how national market system nms stock orders are priced executed and reported the four proposed rules are described below the order competition rule would require that before most individual investors orders could be executed internally by a trading center like wholesaler market makers those orders must first be exposed to a qualifying orderbyorder auction in which both market makers and institutional investors can participate regulation best execution would establish an seclevel best execution standard in addition to the existing finra and msrb best execution rules for brokerdealers and require them to establish maintain and enforce written policies and procedures addressing how the brokerdealer will comply with the best execution standard and make routing or execution decisions for customer orders regulation best execution would apply not only to equities but to all securities amendments to rule of regulation nms requiring enhanced disclosures of order execution quality for large brokers that handle retail orders a rule to i amend minimum pricing increments or tick sizes that would apply to both the quoting and trading of nms stocks ii reduce the exchange access fee caps and iii require transparency of oddlots the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted the comment periods for the proposed rules ended on march while the impacts to schwab of the proposed rules cannot be fully assessed until final rules are released as proposed the rules would have a significant impact to numerous aspects of critical equity market structure and the execution of orders for retail investors among other impacts certain of the proposed rules would likely result in increased transaction costs for retail investors which could affect client investment and trading decisions and would require substantial operational changes for financial intermediaries including the company in november the sec proposed a rule that would require substantial changes to the liquidity risk management programs for openend mutual funds other than money market funds funds and require them to implement swing pricing and impose a hard close on the acceptance of purchase and redemption orders swing pricing would require funds that are not exchangetraded funds or money market funds to adjust the funds current net asset value nav per share by a swing factor if the fund has either i net redemptions no threshold or ii net purchases that exceed a specified threshold of the funds net assets to implement the swing pricing requirements the proposed rule also would require that a fund its transfer agent or a registered clearing agency receive purchase and redemption orders prior to the time the fund has established for determining the nav typically market close in order to receive a given days nav a hard close current practices permit fund orders received by a financial intermediary prior to the fund cutoff time to be transmitted to the fund after the fund cutoff time and still receive that days nav under the proposed rule orders received by the fund its transfer agent or registered clearing agency after the fund cutoff time would receive the next days nav the comment period for the proposed rule ended on february while the impacts to schwab of the proposed rule cannot be fully assessed until the final rule is released we believe the proposed rule could impact investor interest in mutual funds which could lead to changes in investor behavior in addition implementation of the proposed rule would require that financial

changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or market conditions schwab is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates within our interestearning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets to manage interest rate risk we have established policies and procedures which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity eve risk to remain within these limits we manage the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios management monitors established guidelines to stay within the companys risk appetite in the company began to utilize interest rate swap derivative instruments to assist with managing interest rate risk the effects of which are incorporated into the companys net interest revenue and eve analyses for further information on our interest rate risk management strategies utilizing interest rate swaps see item note our measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue bank deposit account fees or eve actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix financial instruments are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument we are indirectly exposed to option futures and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers and client securities loaned out as part of the brokerage securities lending activities equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity margin borrowing and overall client engagement with schwab additionally we earn mutual fund and etf service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue we earn our market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material net interest revenue simulation for our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulations include all balance sheet interest ratesensitive assets and the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted liabilities and include derivative instruments key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors rates and balances of nonmaturity client cash held on the balance sheet prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments repricing of financial instruments and reinvestment of matured or paiddown securities and loans we use independent thirdparty models to simulate net interest revenue sensitivity and related analyses fixed income analytical vendors provide term structure models prepayment speed models for mortgagebacked securities and mortgage loans and cash flow projections based on interest income contractual maturities and prepayments consistent with our policies related to the management of interest rate risk the companys net interest revenue sensitivity analysis primarily involves gradual parallel increasesdecreases in interest rates over a twelvemonth period though we also regularly simulate the effects of nonparallel shifts and instantaneous shifts of interest rates on net interest revenue net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets include investment securities margin loans bank loans and cash and cash equivalents these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans and control the composition of our investment securities we have some ability to manage our net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions when we have liquidity needs that exceed our primary sources of funding the company has needed to utilize highercost funding sources which can reduce net interest margin and net interest revenue higher prevailing shortterm interest rates generally improve yields on shorter duration interestearning assets during periods of rapidly rising interest rates clients tend to reallocate cash out of sweep products into higheryielding offbalance sheet fixed income securities and money market funds within schwabs product offerings this can result in lower interestearning assets andor may require replacement funding with higher funding costs which therefore tend to constrain net interest revenue when interest rates are moving rapidly higher a decline in shortterm interest rates could also negatively impact the yield on the companys investment and loan portfolios to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources compressing net interest margin net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates while this approach is useful to isolate the impact of changes in interest rates on a staticallysized asset and liability structure it does not capture changes to client cash allocations we conduct simulations on eve to capture the impact of client cash allocation changes on our balance sheet as we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure we have taken and would typically seek to take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment as part of the companys ongoing evaluation of its modeling in the fourth quarter of the company updated deposit beta assumptions in a declining market interest rate environment for its net interest revenue simulation model the following table shows simulated changes to net interest revenue over the next months beginning december and of a gradual increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period table start december increase of basis points increase of basis points increase of basis points decrease of basis points decrease of basis points decrease of basis points table end reflects the impact of the assumption updates implemented in the fourth quarter of the prior period has not been recast the companys simulated incremental increases in market interest rates had a larger impact on net interest revenue as of december compared to december primarily due to higher margin loan and cash balances which was partially offset by an increased allocation to fhlb borrowings and other shortterm borrowings across the companys banking subsidiaries in the absence of the assumption updates simulated decreases of and basis points as of december would have reduced net interest revenue by and respectively simulated incremental decreases in market interest rates had a lesser impact on net interest revenue as of december compared to december due primarily to the change in assumptions for deposit betas which along with a lower rate environment drove greater expense the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted savings across nonmaturity deposits and an increased allocation to shorterterm liabilities partially offset by higher concentrations of margin loan and cash balances effective duration effective duration measures price sensitivity relative to a change in prevailing interest rates taking account of amortizing cash flows and prepayment optionality for mortgagerelated securities and loans duration is measured in years and commonly interpreted as the average timing of principal and interest cash flows we seek to manage the companys asset duration in relation to managements estimate of the companys liability duration the companys liability duration is impacted by the composition of funding sources and typically decreases in periods of rising market interest rates and increases in periods of declining market interest rates the companys estimated effective duration of consolidated total assets was approximately years at december inclusive of the impact of derivative instruments and years at december the estimated effective duration of our afs investment securities portfolio was approximately years years inclusive of the impact of derivative instruments as of december and years as of december the estimated effective duration for the companys total afs and htm investment securities portfolio was approximately years as of both december and years inclusive of the impact of derivative instruments on afs securities as of december afs and htm securities comprised approximately and of the companys consolidated total assets as of december and respectively the estimated effective duration of the remaining balance sheet assets in aggregate was less than one year as of both december and economic value of equity simulation management also uses eve simulations to measure interest rate risk eve sensitivity measures the longterm impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities and includes the impact of derivative instruments while eve does not have a direct accounting relationship the measure aims to capture a theoretical value of assets and liabilities under a variety of interest rate environments eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors key assumptions in our eve calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments term structure models of interest rates behavior of nonmaturity client cash held on the balance sheet and pricing assumptions we use both proprietary and independent thirdparty models to simulate eve sensitivity and related analyses we develop and maintain client credits and deposits runoff models internally based on historical experience and prevailing client cash realignment behaviors we rely on thirdparty models for term structure modeling prepayment speed modeling for mortgagebacked securities and mortgage loans and cash flow projections based on interest income contractual maturities and prepayments as interest rates rose throughout eve sensitivity generally trended higher due to a shortening of liability duration while the companys asset duration remained largely stable during the period of rising interest rates liability duration shortened significantly and is now shorter than asset duration bank deposit account fees simulation consistent with the presentation on the consolidated statement of income the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the net interest revenue simulation described above as of december and simulated changes in bank deposit account fee revenue from gradual changes in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates under the interest rate scenarios described above for net interest revenue did not have a significant impact on the companys total net revenues our net interest revenue eve and bank deposit account fee revenue simulations

the market approach to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value and to determine fair value disclosures see item notes and for more information on our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements of schwab have been prepared in accordance with gaap item note contains more information on our significant accounting policies made in applying these accounting principles while the majority of the revenues expenses assets and liabilities are not based on estimates there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on schwabs financial position and financial results these critical accounting estimates are described below management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors additionally management has reviewed with the audit committee the companys significant estimates discussed in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income taxes schwab estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate including federal state and local domestic jurisdictions and immaterial amounts owed to several foreign jurisdictions the estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income in taxes on income accrued taxes are reported in other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets are recognized if in managements judgment their realizability is determined to be more likely than not uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize an uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement in estimating accrued taxes we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates interpretations of tax laws the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities and newly enacted statutory judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions these changes when they occur affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the company see item note for more information on the companys income taxes legal and regulatory reserves reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter after considering among other factors the progress of the case prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases available defenses and the opinions and views of legal counsel in many cases including most class action lawsuits it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred or to estimate the range of that loss until the matter is close to resolution in which case no accrual is made until that time reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved see item note for more information on the companys contingencies related to legal and regulatory reserves the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted nongaap financial measures in addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain references to the nongaap financial measures described below we believe these nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information about the financial performance of the company and facilitate meaningful comparison of schwabs results in the current period to both historic and future results these nongaap measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to nongaap financial measures presented by other companies schwabs use of nongaap measures is reflective of certain adjustments made to gaap financial measures as described below beginning in the third quarter of these adjustments also include restructuring costs which the company began incurring in connection with its previously announced plans to streamline its operations to prepare for postintegration of td ameritrade see item note for additional information table start nongaap adjustment or measure definition usefulness to investors and uses by management acquisition and integrationrelated costs amortization of acquired intangible assets and restructuring costs schwab adjusts certain gaap financial measures to exclude the impact of acquisition and integrationrelated costs incurred as a result of the companys acquisitions amortization of acquired intangible assets restructuring costs and where applicable the income tax effect of these expenses adjustments made to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets are reflective of all acquired intangible assets which were recorded as part of purchase accounting these acquired intangible assets contribute to the companys revenue generation amortization of acquired intangible assets will continue in future periods over their remaining useful lives we exclude acquisition and integrationrelated costs amortization of acquired intangible assets and restructuring costs for the purpose of calculating certain nongaap measures because we believe doing so provides additional transparency of schwabs ongoing operations and is useful in both evaluating the operating performance of the business and facilitating comparison of results with prior and future periods costs related to acquisition and integration or restructuring fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions integration and restructuring activities thereby limiting comparability of results among periods and are not representative of the costs of running the companys ongoing business amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of the companys underlying operating performance return on tangible common equity return on tangible common equity represents annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity tangible common equity represents common equity less goodwill acquired intangible assets net and related deferred tax liabilities acquisitions typically result in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and acquired intangible assets we believe return on tangible common equity may be useful to investors as a supplemental measure to facilitate assessing capital efficiency and returns relative to the composition of schwabs balance sheet adjusted tier leverage ratio adjusted tier leverage ratio represents the tier leverage ratio as prescribed by bank regulatory guidance for the consolidated company and for csb adjusted to reflect the inclusion of aoci in the ratio inclusion of the impacts of aoci in the companys tier leverage
