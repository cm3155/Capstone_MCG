interest revenue schwabs primary interestearning assets include cash and cash equivalents cash and investments segregated margin loans which constitute the majority of receivables from brokerage clients investment securities and bank loans revenue on interestearning assets is affected by various factors such as the composition of assets prevailing interest rates and spreads at the time of origination or purchase changes in interest rates on floating rate securities and loans and changes in prepayment levels for mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities and loans fees earned on securities borrowing and lending activities which are conducted by csco using assets held in client brokerage accounts are primarily included in other interest revenue and expense schwabs interestbearing liabilities include bank deposits payables to brokerage clients shortterm borrowings eg federal home loan bank fhlb advances and longterm debt noninterestbearing funding sources include stockholders equity certain client cash balances and other miscellaneous liabilities we establish the rates paid on clientrelated liabilities and management expects that it will generally adjust the rates paid on these liabilities at some fraction of any movement in shortterm rates schwab deploys the funds from these sources into the the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted assets outlined above we do not use shortterm wholesale borrowings to support our longterm investment activity but may use such funding including fhlb advances for shortterm liquidity purposes or to provide temporary funding eg for investment purchases ahead of anticipated balance sheet deposit growth in order to keep interestrate sensitivity within established limits management actively monitors and adjusts interestrate sensitivity through changes in the balance sheet primarily by adjusting the composition of our banking subsidiaries investment portfolios as schwab builds its client base we attract new client sweep cash which is a primary driver of funding balance sheet growth towards the end of the federal funds target interest rate increased to levels not seen in over a decade leading us to expect some clients would shift more of their cash holdings from brokerage deposits swept to our banking subsidiaries to higheryielding alternatives like purchased money market funds we therefore expected brokerage deposits swept to our banking subsidiaries excluding organic growth to decline during the first part of as a result we held a higher amount of shortterm liquidity at our banking subsidiaries at the end of to accommodate this potential client cash sorting while average interest rates throughout the year in were higher than average rates in interest rates across maturities declined from december to december lower interest rates typically result in longer durations on our clientrelated liabilities and shorter durations on our investment securities especially mortgagerelated securities with options to prepay without penalty during to maintain our overall targeted interest rate risk profile we began positioning our banking entities investment portfolios to include a higher percentage of fixedrate longer duration investments to reduce our interest rate sensitivities which would naturally increase as market rates declined we did however once again hold a higher level of shortterm liquidity at the end of to accommodate a typical seasonal buildup of client cash much of which then generally moves to other assets within a few months we believe that the process of clients sorting between transactional cash and cash held for investment is subsiding aligned with market consensus we do not expect to see a significant increase in market rates in the near term over the course of we expect to further reduce our exposure to lower rates primarily by adding a larger percentage of fixedrate securities with relatively longer duration to our ongoing purchases as a result of maturities prepayments organic deposit growth onboarding of usaaimco client cash to our balance sheet and any potential assetliabilitymanagementdriven investment portfolio rebalancing as such we expect the duration difference between our liabilities and assets to decline over the course of the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in

of financial instruments and reinvestment of matured or paiddown securities and loans net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets primarily include investment securities margin loans and bank loans these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans and control the composition of our investment securities we have some ability to manage our net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in

that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the simulated net interest revenue change over the next months beginning december and of a gradual basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period table start december increase of basis points decrease of basis points table end the yearoveryear change in net interest revenue sensitivities reflects lower interest rates across the yield curve producing higher adverse sensitivity to lower rates as funding costs more rapidly reach rate floor assumptions in addition to measuring the effect of a gradual basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel and nonparallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue economic value of equity simulation management also uses economic value of equity eve simulations to measure interest rate risk eve sensitivity measures the longterm impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment key

addition to the direct holdings in foreign companies and securities issued by foreign government agencies schwab had outstanding margin loans to foreign residents of million at december fair value of financial instruments schwab uses the market approach to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value and to determine fair value disclosures see item notes and for more information on our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value when available schwab uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities quoted prices for investments in exchangetraded securities represent endofday close prices published by exchanges quoted prices for money market funds and other mutual funds represent reported net asset values when utilizing market data and bidask spread we use the price within the bidask spread that best represents fair value when quoted prices in active markets do not exist prices are obtained from independent thirdparty pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets we generally obtain prices from three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value our primary thirdparty pricing service provides prices for our fixed income investments such as commercial paper certificates of deposits us government and agency securities state and municipal securities corporate debt securities assetbacked securities foreign government agency securities and nonagency commercial mortgagebacked securities such prices are based on observable trades brokerdealer quotes and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads and weightedaverage maturity for the same or similar tobeissued securities we compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent thirdparty pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded at december and we did not adjust prices received from the primary independent thirdparty pricing service critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements of schwab have been prepared in accordance with gaap item note contains more information on our significant accounting policies made in connection with its application of these accounting principles while the majority of the revenues expenses assets and liabilities are not based on estimates there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on schwabs financial position and reported financial results these critical accounting estimates are described below management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors additionally management has reviewed with the audit committee the companys significant estimates discussed in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income taxes schwab estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate including federal state and local domestic jurisdictions and immaterial amounts owed to several foreign jurisdictions the estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income in taxes on income accrued taxes are reported in other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets are recognized if in managements judgment their realizability is determined to be more likely than not uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize an uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement in estimating accrued taxes we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates interpretations of tax laws the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities and newly enacted statutory judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions these changes when they occur affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the company see item note for more information on the companys income taxes legal and regulatory reserves reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter after considering among other factors the progress of the case prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases available defenses and the opinions and views of legal counsel in many cases including most class action lawsuits it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred or to estimate the range of that loss until the matter is close to resolution in which case no accrual is made until that time reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved see item note for more information on the companys contingencies related to legal and regulatory reserves the charles schwab corporation
