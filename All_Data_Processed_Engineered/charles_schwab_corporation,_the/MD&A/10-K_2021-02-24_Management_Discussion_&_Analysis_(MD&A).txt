a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or market conditions schwab is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on our interestearning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets to manage interest rate risk we have established policies and procedures which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity risk to remain within these limits we manage the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios management monitors established guidelines to stay within the companys risk appetite our measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue bank deposit account fees or economic value of equity eve actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix financial instruments are also

ratesensitive assets and liabilities key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments repricing of financial instruments and reinvestment of matured or paiddown securities and loans net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets include investment securities margin loans and bank loans these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans and control the composition of our investment securities we have some ability to manage our net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted the following table shows the simulated change to net interest revenue over the next months beginning december and of a gradual basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period table start december increase of basis points decrease of basis points table end the change in sensitivities of net interest revenue as of december reflects a significantly lower interest rate curve relative to december due to the global economic impact from the covid19 pandemic higher shortterm interest rates would positively impact net interest revenue as yields on interestearning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources a decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the companys investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources compressing net interest margin in addition to measuring the effect of a gradual basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel and nonparallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue economic value of equity simulation management also uses eve simulations to measure interest rate risk eve sensitivity measures the longterm impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment key assumptions in our eve calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments term structure models of interest rates nonmaturity deposit behavior and pricing assumptions our net interest revenue and eve simulations reflect the assumption of nonnegative investment yields bank deposit account fees simulations consistent with the presentation on our statement of income the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the interest rate sensitivity analysis described above as of december the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to changes in interest rates is limited as a significant portion of bda deposit balances are allocated to fixedrate obligation amounts expected phaseout of libor the company has established a firmwide team to address the phasingout of libor by june as part of our efforts we have assessed our libor exposures the largest of which are certain investment securities and loans in purchasing new investment securities we ensure that appropriate fallback language is in the securitys prospectus in the event that libor is unavailable or deemed unreliable and

financial distress schwab is required to maintain a tier leverage ratio for csc of at least and we have a longterm operating objective of due to the relatively low risk of our balance sheet assets and riskbased capital ratios at csc and csb that are well in excess of regulatory requirements the tier leverage ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on cscs asset growth our banking subsidiaries are subject to capital requirements set by their regulators that are substantially similar to those imposed on csc by the federal reserve our banking subsidiaries failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that could have a direct material effect on the banks schwabs principal banking subsidiary csb is required to maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least to be well capitalized but seeks to maintain a ratio of at least based on its regulatory capital ratios at december csb is considered well capitalized as a result of the significant inflow of client cash in our tier leverage ratios for csc and csb declined from and respectively at yearend to and respectively at december though below our longterm operating objectives these ratios are well above the regulatory minimum for both csc and csb the pace of our return to the longterm operating objectives over time depends on a number of

uninsured ida balances on june as well as optional ida balances in future periods as available pursuant to the terms of the ida agreement the companys ability to migrate these balances to its balance

corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted fair value of financial instruments schwab uses the market approach to determine the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value and to determine fair value disclosures see item notes and for more information on our assets and liabilities recorded at fair value when available schwab uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities quoted prices for investments in exchangetraded securities represent endofday close prices published by exchanges quoted prices for money market funds and other mutual funds represent reported net asset values when utilizing market data and bidask spread we use the price within the bidask spread that best represents fair value when quoted prices in active markets do not exist prices are obtained from independent thirdparty pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets we generally obtain prices from three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value our primary thirdparty pricing service provides prices for our fixed income investments such as commercial paper certificates of deposits us government and agency securities state and municipal securities corporate debt securities assetbacked securities foreign government agency securities and nonagency commercial mortgagebacked securities such prices are based on observable trades brokerdealer quotes and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads and weightedaverage maturity for the same or similar tobeissued securities we compare the prices obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable schwab does not adjust the prices received from independent thirdparty pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material differences in the amounts recorded at december and we did not adjust prices received from the primary independent thirdparty pricing service critical accounting estimates the consolidated financial statements of schwab have been prepared in accordance with gaap item note contains more information on our significant accounting policies made in applying these accounting principles while the majority of the revenues expenses assets and liabilities are not based on estimates there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on schwabs financial position and financial results these critical accounting estimates are described below management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors additionally management has reviewed with the audit committee the companys significant estimates discussed in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income taxes schwab estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate including federal state and local domestic jurisdictions and immaterial amounts owed to several foreign jurisdictions the estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income in taxes on income accrued taxes are reported in other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and represent the net estimated amount due to or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or deferred to future periods deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting purposes versus income tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets are recognized if in managements judgment their realizability is determined to be more likely than not uncertain tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize an uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement in estimating accrued taxes we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates interpretations of tax laws the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities and newly enacted statutory judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of tax positions these changes when they occur affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the operating results of the company see item note for more information on the companys income taxes legal and regulatory reserves reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter after considering among other factors the progress of the case prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases available defenses and the opinions and views of legal counsel in many cases including most class action lawsuits it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred or to estimate the range of that loss until the matter is close to resolution in which case no accrual is made until that time reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved see item note for more information on the companys contingencies related to legal and regulatory reserves business combinations we have accounted for our acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting the acquisition method requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date as we allocate the purchase price to the estimated fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets and the liabilities assumed we also use our best estimates to determine the useful lives of the tangible and definitelived intangible assets which impact the periods over which depreciation and amortization of those assets are recognized these best estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain as they pertain to forward looking views of our businesses client behavior and market conditions in our acquisitions we have also recognized goodwill at the amount by which the purchase price paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired see item note for more information on our valuation methods and the results of applying the acquisition method of accounting including the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and where relevant the estimated remaining useful lives our ongoing accounting for goodwill and the tangible and intangible assets acquired requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions as we exercise judgement to evaluate these assets for impairment our processes and accounting policies for evaluating impairments are further described in item note one of our reporting units has an immaterial amount of goodwill the results of the annual goodwill impairment testing for our other two reporting units indicated that the estimated fair values substantially exceeded their carrying amounts nongaap financial measures in addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with gaap managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain references to the nongaap financial measures described below we believe these nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information about the financial performance of the company and facilitate meaningful comparison of schwabs results in the current period to both historic and future results these nongaap measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to nongaap financial measures presented by other companies the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted schwabs use of nongaap measures is reflective of certain adjustments made to gaap financial measures as described below table start nongaap adjustment or measure definition usefulness to investors and uses by management acquisition and integrationrelated costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets schwab adjusts certain gaap financial measures to exclude the impact of acquisition and integrationrelated costs incurred as a result of the companys acquisitions amortization of acquired intangible assets and where applicable the income tax effect of these expenses adjustments made to exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets are reflective of all acquired intangible assets which were recorded as part of purchase accounting these acquired intangible assets contribute to the companys revenue generation amortization of acquired intangible assets will continue in future periods over their remaining useful lives we exclude acquisition and integrationrelated costs and amortization of acquired intangible assets for the purpose of calculating certain nongaap measures because we believe doing so provides additional transparency of schwabs ongoing operations and is useful in both evaluating the operating performance of the business and facilitating comparison of results with prior and future periods acquisition and integrationrelated costs fluctuate based on the timing of acquisitions and integration activities thereby limiting comparability of results among periods and are not representative of the costs of running the companys ongoing business amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded because management does not believe it is indicative of the companys underlying operating performance return on tangible common equity return on tangible common equity represents annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity tangible common equity represents common equity less goodwill acquired intangible assets net and related deferred tax liabilities acquisitions typically result in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and acquired intangible assets we believe return on tangible common equity may be useful to investors as a supplemental measure to facilitate assessing capital efficiency and returns relative to the composition of schwabs balance sheet table end beginning in the company also uses adjusted diluted eps and return on tangible common equity as components of performance criteria for employee bonus and certain executive management incentive compensation arrangements the compensation committee of cscs board of directors maintains discretion in evaluating performance
