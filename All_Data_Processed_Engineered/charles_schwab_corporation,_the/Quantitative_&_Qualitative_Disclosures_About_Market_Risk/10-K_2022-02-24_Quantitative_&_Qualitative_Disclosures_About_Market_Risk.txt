risk management schwabs business activities expose it to a variety of risks including operational compliance credit market and liquidity risks the company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact despite our efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures there can be no assurance that schwab will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks our risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment risk measurement risk monitoring and reporting and risk mitigation controls we use periodic risk and control selfassessments control testing programs and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls the activities and governance that comprise the risk management process are described below the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition

purpose vision and values which form the bedrock of our corporate culture and set the tone for the organization we designed the erm framework to enable a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered by schwab in its business activities the framework incorporates key concepts commensurate with the size risk profile complexity and continuing growth of the company risk appetite which is defined as the amount of risk the company is willing to accept in pursuit of its corporate strategy is developed by executive management and approved by the board of directors risk governance senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying measuring and controlling risks the global risk committee which is comprised of senior executives from each major business and control function is responsible for the oversight of risk management this includes identifying emerging risks assessing risk management practices and the control environment reinforcing business accountability for risk management supervisory controls and regulatory compliance supporting resource prioritization across the organization and escalating significant issues to the board of directors we have established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite the risk metrics with risk limits and tolerance levels are established for key risk categories by the global risk committee and its functional risk subcommittees the chief risk officer regularly reports activities of the global risk committee to the risk committee of the board of directors the board risk committee in turn assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to our risk management program including approving risk appetite statements and related key risk appetite metrics and reviewing

systems or from external events or relationships impacting the company andor any of its key business partners and third parties while operational risk is inherent in all business activities we rely on a system of internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep operational risk and operational losses within the companys risk appetite we have specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk and use control testing programs and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls where appropriate we manage the impact of

settle transactions with clearing corporations mutual funds and other financial institutions even if schwabs clients or a counterparty fail to meet their obligations to the company market risk market risk is the potential for changes in earnings or the value of financial instruments held by schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or market conditions schwab is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates within our interestearning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets to manage interest rate risk we have established policies and procedures which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity eve risk to remain within these limits we manage the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios management monitors established guidelines to stay within the companys risk appetite our measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue bank deposit account fees or eve actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix financial instruments are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument we are indirectly exposed to option futures and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers and client securities loaned out as part of the brokerage securities lending activities equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity margin borrowing and overall client engagement with schwab additionally we earn mutual fund and etf service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue we earn our market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material interest rate risk simulations net interest revenue simulation for our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulations include all balance sheet interest ratesensitive assets and liabilities key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments repricing of financial instruments and reinvestment of matured or paiddown securities and loans net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets include investment securities margin loans and bank loans these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans and control the composition of our investment securities we have some ability to manage our net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates as we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood we would take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment the following table shows the simulated change to net interest revenue over the next months beginning december and of a gradual basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period december increase of basis points decrease of basis points the companys simulated increase of basis points in market interest rates had a slightly lower impact on net interest revenue at yearend compared with yearend due to an increase in the companys projected repricing of client deposit rates across higher market interest rate scenarios which was partially offset as a result of holding a higher allocation of floatingrate assets on the balance sheet at december relative to the prior yearend a simulated decrease of basis points in market interest rates had a slightly larger impact yearoveryear primarily as a result of holding a higher allocation of floatingrate assets higher shortterm interest rates would positively impact net interest revenue as yields on interestearning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources a decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the companys investment and loan portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources compressing net interest margin the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted in addition to measuring the effect of a gradual basis point parallel increase or decrease in current interest rates we regularly simulate the effects of larger parallel and nonparallel shifts in interest rates on net interest revenue bank deposit account fees simulation consistent with the presentation on the consolidated statement of income the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the net interest revenue simulation described above as of december and simulated changes in bank deposit account fee revenue from gradual basis point changes in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates did not have a significant impact on the companys total net revenues economic value of equity simulation management also uses eve simulations to measure interest rate risk eve sensitivity measures the longterm impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors as well as our expectations of the economic environment key assumptions in our eve calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments term structure models of interest rates nonmaturity deposit behavior and pricing assumptions our net interest revenue bank deposit account fee revenue and eve simulations reflect the assumption of nonnegative investment yields phaseout of libor the company continues to prepare for the phasingout of libor undertaking many efforts coordinated by its firmwide transition team the libor transition team is overseen by executive leadership and has organized its efforts to address both clientimpacting and nonclientimpacting workstreams from a client perspective the company has established pages on the clientfacing websites for csco and td ameritrade inc to provide information for our clients to help them understand how they may be impacted by libors discontinuation in addition we maintain internal informational resources for our clientfacing employees awareness regarding libors phaseout the companys largest exposures to libor are certain investment securities and loans in purchasing new investment securities we ensure that appropriate fallback language is in place in the event that libor becomes unavailable or is deemed unreliable and we have sold certain securities lacking appropriate fallback language additionally in accordance with regulatory feedback we are limiting our purchases of liborbased securities and we ensure that any new purchases of liborbased securities were issued prior to january as of december substantially all of the companys remaining investment securities with exposure to libor provide for appropriate fallback in the event libor is no longer available consistent with guidance from the alternative reference rate committee a group of privatemarket participants jointly convened by the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york to help ensure a successful transition from libor the company phasedout the use of libor as a reference rate in new loans prior to yearend and the companys portfolio of legacy loans have fallback language if libor is no longer available certain of the companys technology systems and financial models have historically utilized libor and we have
