or the value of financial instruments held by schwab as a result of fluctuations in interest rates equity prices or market conditions schwab is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates within our interestearning assets relative to changes in the costs of funding sources that finance these assets to manage interest rate risk we have established policies and procedures which include setting limits on net interest revenue risk and economic value of equity eve risk to remain within these limits we manage the maturity repricing and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios management monitors established guidelines to stay within the companys risk appetite in the company began to utilize interest rate swap derivative instruments to assist with managing interest rate risk the effects of which are incorporated into the companys net interest revenue and eve analyses for further information on our interest rate risk management strategies utilizing interest rate swaps see item note our measurement of interest rate risk involves assumptions that are inherently uncertain and as a result cannot precisely estimate the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue bank deposit account fees or eve actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies including changes in asset and liability mix financial instruments are also subject to the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument we are indirectly exposed to option futures and equity market fluctuations in connection with client option and futures accounts securities collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers and client securities loaned out as part of the brokerage securities lending activities equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity margin borrowing and overall client engagement with schwab additionally we earn mutual fund and etf service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue we earn our market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material net interest revenue simulation for our net interest revenue sensitivity analysis we use net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates the simulations include all balance sheet interest ratesensitive assets and the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted liabilities and include derivative instruments key assumptions include the projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors rates and balances of nonmaturity client cash held on the balance sheet prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments repricing of financial instruments and reinvestment of matured or paiddown securities and loans we use independent thirdparty models to simulate net interest revenue sensitivity and related analyses fixed income analytical vendors provide term structure models prepayment speed models for mortgagebacked securities and mortgage loans and cash flow projections based on interest income contractual maturities and prepayments consistent with our policies related to the management of interest rate risk the companys net interest revenue sensitivity analysis primarily involves gradual parallel increasesdecreases in interest rates over a twelvemonth period though we also regularly simulate the effects of nonparallel shifts and instantaneous shifts of interest rates on net interest revenue net interest revenue is affected by various factors such as the distribution and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the spread between yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on interestbearing liabilities which may reprice at different times or by different amounts and the spread between short and longterm interest rates interestearning assets include investment securities margin loans bank loans and cash and cash equivalents these assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes in prepayment levels that tend to increase in a declining rate environment and decrease in a rising rate environment because we establish the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and bank deposits and the rates charged on certain margin and bank loans and control the composition of our investment securities we have some ability to manage our net interest spread depending on competitive factors and market conditions when we have liquidity needs that exceed our primary sources of funding the company has needed to utilize highercost funding sources which can reduce net interest margin and net interest revenue higher prevailing shortterm interest rates generally improve yields on shorter duration interestearning assets during periods of rapidly rising interest rates clients tend to reallocate cash out of sweep products into higheryielding offbalance sheet fixed income securities and money market funds within schwabs product offerings this can result in lower interestearning assets andor may require replacement funding with higher funding costs which therefore tend to constrain net interest revenue when interest rates are moving rapidly higher a decline in shortterm interest rates could also negatively impact the yield on the companys investment and loan portfolios to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding sources compressing net interest margin net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates while this approach is useful to isolate the impact of changes in interest rates on a staticallysized asset and liability structure it does not capture changes to client cash allocations we conduct simulations on eve to capture the impact of client cash allocation changes on our balance sheet as we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure we have taken and would typically seek to take steps to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment as part of the companys ongoing evaluation of its modeling in the fourth quarter of the company updated deposit beta assumptions in a declining market interest rate environment for its net interest revenue simulation model the following table shows simulated changes to net interest revenue over the next months beginning december and of a gradual increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period december increase of basis points increase of basis points increase of basis points decrease of basis points decrease of basis points decrease of basis points reflects the impact of the assumption updates implemented in the fourth quarter of the prior period has not been recast the companys simulated incremental increases in market interest rates had a larger impact on net interest revenue as of december compared to december primarily due to higher margin loan and cash balances which was partially offset by an increased allocation to fhlb borrowings and other shortterm borrowings across the companys banking subsidiaries in the absence of the assumption updates simulated decreases of and basis points as of december would have reduced net interest revenue by and respectively simulated incremental decreases in market interest rates had a lesser impact on net interest revenue as of december compared to december due primarily to the change in assumptions for deposit betas which along with a lower rate environment drove greater expense the charles schwab corporation managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular amounts in millions except ratios or as noted savings across nonmaturity deposits and an increased allocation to shorterterm liabilities partially offset by higher concentrations of margin loan and cash balances effective duration effective duration measures price sensitivity relative to a change in prevailing interest rates taking account of amortizing cash flows and prepayment optionality for mortgagerelated securities and loans duration is measured in years and commonly interpreted as the average timing of principal and interest cash flows we seek to manage the companys asset duration in relation to managements estimate of the companys liability duration the companys liability duration is impacted by the composition of funding sources and typically decreases in periods of rising market interest rates and increases in periods of declining market interest rates the companys estimated effective duration of consolidated total assets was approximately years at december inclusive of the impact of derivative instruments and years at december the estimated effective duration of our afs investment securities portfolio was approximately years years inclusive of the impact of derivative instruments as of december and years as of december the estimated effective duration for the companys total afs and htm investment securities portfolio was approximately years as of both december and years inclusive of the impact of derivative instruments on afs securities as of december afs and htm securities comprised approximately and of the companys consolidated total assets as of december and respectively the estimated effective duration of the remaining balance sheet assets in aggregate was less than one year as of both december and economic value of equity simulation management also uses eve simulations to measure interest rate risk eve sensitivity measures the longterm impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities and includes the impact of derivative instruments while eve does not have a direct accounting relationship the measure aims to capture a theoretical value of assets and liabilities under a variety of interest rate environments eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to hypothetical instantaneous shifts in the level of interest rates this analysis is highly dependent upon asset and liability assumptions based on historical behaviors key assumptions in our eve calculation include projection of interest rate scenarios with rate floors prepayment speeds of mortgagerelated investments term structure models of interest rates behavior of nonmaturity client cash held on the balance sheet and pricing assumptions we use both proprietary and independent thirdparty models to simulate eve sensitivity and related analyses we develop and maintain client credits and deposits runoff models internally based on historical experience and prevailing client cash realignment behaviors we rely on thirdparty models for term structure modeling prepayment speed modeling for mortgagebacked securities and mortgage loans and cash flow projections based on interest income contractual maturities and prepayments as interest rates rose throughout eve sensitivity generally trended higher due to a shortening of liability duration while the companys asset duration remained largely stable during the period of rising interest rates liability duration shortened significantly and is now shorter than asset duration bank deposit account fees simulation consistent with the presentation on the consolidated statement of income the sensitivity of bank deposit account fee revenue to interest rate changes is assessed separately from the net interest revenue simulation described above as of december and simulated changes in bank deposit account fee revenue from gradual changes in market interest rates relative to prevailing market rates under the interest rate scenarios described above for net interest revenue did not have a significant impact on the companys total net revenues our net interest revenue eve and bank deposit account fee revenue simulations

banking subsidiaries principal and interest due on corporate debt and dividend payments on cscs preferred and common stock the liquidity needs of our brokerdealer subsidiaries are primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin lending activities and capital expenditures the capital needs of the banking subsidiaries are primarily driven by client deposit levels and other borrowings we have established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions we seek to maintain client confidence in the balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the company to meet its obligations to this end we have established limits and contingency funding plans to support liquidity levels during both business as usual

ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during marketrelated or companyspecific liquidity stress events liquidity sources are also tested periodically and results are reported to the financial risk oversight committee a number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the organization and are reviewed with management

including us treasury securities our clients bank deposits and brokerage cash balances primarily originate from our million active brokerage accounts more than of our bank deposits qualified for fdic insurance as of december our clients allocation of cash held on our balance sheet as bank deposits or payables to brokerage clients is sensitive to interest rate levels with clients typically increasing their utilization of investment cash solutions such as purchased money market funds and certain fixed income products when those yields are higher than those of cash sweep features schwabs need for borrowings from external debt facilities arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements including in the event the outflow of client cash from the balance sheet is greater than cash flows from operations and investment securities and bank loans payments on interestearning investments movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation
