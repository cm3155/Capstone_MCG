management discussion section jeff edwards managing director headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp hello and welcome to the schwab fall business update this is jeff edwards head of investor relations and im joined today by our panel of presenters cochairman and ceo walt bettinger president rick wurster and cfo peter crawford we have plenty to cover today so im certainly going to get out of the way here pretty quickly but lets touch on a few housekeeping matters similar to past events ill be helping facilitate qa and another friendly reminder to please adhere to the one question no followup format as always please dont hesitate to reach out to your friendly ir team with any clarifying or other reconciling questions the slides for todays business update will be posted to the ir website at the beginning of peters section and finally the forwardlooking statements page in all its glory which reminds us all that the future is indeed uncertain so please stay in touch with our ongoing disclosures and with that ill turn it over to walt walter w bettinger ii cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp good morning everyone thank you for joining us for our october business update rick peter and i are excited to share good news with you as we review our third quarter youll hear about our tremendous progress in the conversion of former ameritrade clients over to schwab our ongoing success serving clients and gathering assets the significant opportunity for ongoing organic growth and marked improvement in some of the key indicators that have attracted outsized attention recently including the pace of client cash realignment but maybe most importantly youll hear about the consistency of our strategy our ideal positioning in the fastest growing segments of the investment services industry our everstrengthening position as the low cost provider the worldclass trust and confidence our clients place in us our superior pretax profit margins even during one of the most difficult environments possible for our financial model and our commitment to disciplined ongoing investments designed to drive organic growth for many years to come now certainly i understand that the overall backdrop of the environment today is decidedly negative and i understand that for some it might be easier to look at the nearterm challenges we face at schwab but i encourage you to consider the entirety of our position and the potential it creates for the future so the actions of the federal reserve to recover from their mistaken transitory inflation viewpoint continue to reverberate across the financial markets these actions are slowing the rate of inflation but at a significant cost to the markets to consumers to investors and to firms like schwab while shortterm interest rates continued to rise over the past year longer term rates are now also rising during the third quarter investors began to feel this pain they acknowledge it as investor sentiment plunged during the quarter moving down into bear market sentiment of course its not surprising as both equity and fixed income markets continued to suffer cash was virtually the only safe place to invest an interesting perspective as at schwab we have always believed that cash should be a key part of every investors longterm investment portfolio the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 16oct2023 i think its particularly important to look at the chart on the bottom of this slide and place ourselves in the minds of investors who viewed their bonds as conservative ballast against the expected volatility of equity markets even those who maintained shorter bond holdings of two to five years have seen substantial declines in their assets between and again truly there have been few places for investors to go in recent times to avoid losses other than in cash and of course at schwab weve been similarly impacted by falling bond prices and a rush to cash investments but throughout this period our clients have continued to trust us continued to be loyal and continue to recommend schwab as a place for their friends and family to invest and third parties clearly feel the same way with schwab bank recently named by a wide margin incidentally the most trusted bank in the industry by investors business daily and schwab was ranked by jd power as number one in investor satisfaction among fullservice wealth management firms i share these thirdparty endorsements not because we place undue weight on them but as a reminder that our strong client positioning contributes to our optimism for ongoing organic growth and the metrics back this up yeartodate weve captured approximately billion in core net new assets and opened well over million new brokerage accounts of course these firmwide new asset figures reflect the expected attrition from the integration of ameritrade clients and of course the july and august net new asset figures were impacted as some of the ria firms from ameritrade opted to find alternative custodians ahead of our labor day conversion by either their decision or in cases by ours and while this attrition weighed on our net new assets for those two months it was less than what we had allowed for in our original dealrelated modeling and it has largely passed looking only at clients who originally opened their accounts at schwab weve captured approximately billion in core net new assets yeartodate an increase of about yearoveryear again illustrating the strength of the business and that works out to an over organic growth rate so let me pivot here for a few moments to speak more indepth about the ameritrade acquisition and progress on our integration efforts we announced the deal in late merely a few months before the covid pandemic hit at the time of that deal announcement ameritrade had approximately trillion in client assets million client brokerage accounts and was processing about million trades per day by the time we got to yearend these figures had grown substantially to approximately trillion in client assets million client brokerage accounts and amazingly about million trades per day from the day the deal was approved by stockholders and regulators we began an integration process that we referred to as best of both it means that unlike in most acquisitions where the acquired firms clients are merely ported over to the acquiring firms platforms we instead carefully evaluated the capabilities of both firms and built capabilities that would maintain and leverage the best of both firms services and platforms this approach was consistent with our through clients eyes strategy and we believe it also sets up the combined firm in an ideal position for longterm organic growth after the integration is complete so where are we today weve completed three of five total transition groups these groups make up about of the total ameritrade retail clients and of the ria firms who previously custodied their client assets at ameritrade todate weve executed this integration with a level of accuracy and service that i have not previously seen in any conversion during the three conversions todate our speed to answer client phone calls has averaged less than minute and with our largest conversion over the labor day weekend now completed we are averaging complaints the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 16oct2023 per million of converted accounts i just want to reemphasize that complaints per million of converted accounts just to put that into context client escalations during the meme stock activity in early there were approximately escalations per million accounts now clearly there is an adjustment period for some of our clients as they familiarize themselves with new processes new websites new mobile apps and we continue to make enhancements in every one of these areas the work is far from done but even the most negative observers have acknowledged the skill and attention to detail that is going into our integration efforts and clients are responding former ameritrade retail clients are rewarding us with levels of loyalty and retention that are far better than we anticipated when we announced the acquisition back in and similarly attrition from former ameritrade ria custodial clients is also below our estimate even taking into consideration the substantial amount of assets that we actively moved away from because we felt these firms did not either fit our risk profile at schwab or whod be better served by converting to an alternative custodian given the ria firms emphasis on maintaining a substantial sales commission driven business model and as weve communicated almost all ria attrition occurs before the conversion date because a firm considering leaving schwab would not want their employees and clients to learn our new processes and technology only to switch to a different custodian and have to relearn all new processes and technology at that new custodian we carefully tracked all ria firms and their engagement with the many seminars and planning events that we offered prior to the conversion weekend and not surprisingly those firms who took advantage of these programs which make up the majority of the client assets have had the smoothest path to conversion lastly the vast majority of active former ameritrade ria firms are operating their businesses placing trades and already opening new accounts on the schwab platform where ria firms have offered us suggestions for enhancements and improvements were fast at work making these and were grateful to the firms for their ideas when we complete the final two transition groups we are confident that we will have the broadest most robust offering in investment services for individual investors and the advisors who serve them from industryleading advisory solutions to worldclass trading platforms banking solutions at exceptional pricing awardwinning digital content and investor education including the newly renamed schwab network phone service combined with almost branches for inperson planning and service value pricing that is supported by what we believe is the lowest cost structure in the industry and a rich history of client benefiting disruption rick before i turn it over to you i want to take a moment to review a slide that ive shared in the past despite the environment despite the noise we are supremely confident in our positioning for longterm growth as i mentioned earlier we are ideally positioned among the fastestgrowing segments of investment services our competitive advantages are unmatched and our current domestic market share is modest at approximately i truly believe the opportunity before us is quite bright rick richard a wurster president the charles schwab corp thank you walt and good morning everyone i want to spend our time today talking about how weve driven to organic growth historically and how we plan to drive it in the future through our model of generating to of nna growth from our existing clients and to of growth from new clients and a return on our strategic focus areas the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 16oct2023 our through clients eyes strategy has allowed us to generate to growth from existing clients when clients turn to schwab they know they will get industryleading value exceptional service and transparency in every interaction they have by treating clients the way they want to be treated we build trust and were able to deepen relationships and capture a greater share of wallet you see this in the billion in yeartodate nna we see from existing retail clients and the billion in yeartodate nna we see from existing advisor clients we have also been able to consistently drive to asset growth from new clients this is due in part to our diversified acquisition model which includes leveraging the strong personal relationships created by our branch footprint and our ria service model earning referrals from our delighted clients and deploying datadriven marketing campaigns and investing in complementary acquisition channels including our workplace business which ill talk more about shortly yeartodate this has driven newtofirm households to our retail business approximately of whom are under age and approximately advisorintransition teams the third part of our growth recipe is our continued investment in our strategic focus areas ill start today with scale and efficiency we shared with you in july that we are taking steps to enhance our flexibility and efficiency with an annual run rate expense savings target of billionplus walt spoke earlier about our ameritrade integration and one component of our expense savings will come from capturing million in remaining ameritrade expense synergies another millionplus in annual savings will come from streamlining our operating model which includes eliminating positions from predominantly nonclientfacing areas and reducing our real estate footprint as weve previously shared these actions are expected to result in a nongaap expense charge of million to million a portion of which you saw in our results this morning with the remainder to follow either later this year or in with these actions we expect yearoveryear expense growth to be roughly flat even while we continue to invest aggressively in client products and service its this investment that leads to the winwin monetization ill talk about now one area we are investing in and one ive discussed in this forum several times is wealth ive said it before there is a bull market for advice today we have approximately billion in retail assets receiving ongoing advisory services not only do these clients see schwab as a place to get advice but our advice offers have among the highest client promoter scores across all of schwab with the investments weve made and continue to make more and more of our retail clients are turning to us for wealth management as they move into a life phase where they need advice you can see this in our managed investing flows where weve seen yeartodate record highs in schwab wealth advisory wasmer schroeder and schwab personalized indexing yeartodate net flows in the schwab wealth advisory are a record billion up nearly over last year the third quarter was also a record quarter for schwab wealth advisory with billion in flows coming into our flagship wealth solution yeartodate net flows into wasmer schroeder are a record billion up nearly over last year while we believe we are still in the early days clients and fcs are starting to learn about the potential benefits of direct indexing and accommodation of tax benefits and personalization are attractive to them lending is also an increasingly important part of the wealth management relationship and weve recently launched a fully digital onboarding experience that lets advisors access a pledged asset line or a pal for their clients the new pal process reduced the time to submit a pal application to just minutes and enables clients to be approved in just one to two days growing pal is a winwin opportunity its good for the advisor because it helps them retain assets and compete with banks and its good for schwab because of the positive spread to securities the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 16oct2023 now ill turn to another area where we have a winwin monetization opportunity and thats our workplace business our workplace business meets the needs of individuals who become investors through their employers and includes our retirement plan business and our stock plan business among others this business is strategic as it allows us to introduce millions of workplace participants to schwab many of whom are investing for the very first time providing us with a pipeline of future retail and advisor services clients workplace connects more than employers advisory firms and million investor households to greater schwab in fact today one in three newtofirm households at schwab are originated through our workplace business we retain of eligible rollover retirement assets and our stock plan business contributes about to retail nna and finally nearly of workplace households have a broader relationship at schwab and when they do they have times the assets through those relationships with workplace we have an opportunity to fuel nna growth for schwab into the future through our grow retain and extend approach to do this we are making investments to more fully integrate our workplace digital experiences so participants can benefit from all we have to offer on schwabcom mobile and with our broader retail offer and were investing in our technology this will require a multiyear investment and well provide a deeper dive and more specifics about this opportunity at future updates ill turn now to our third strategic focus area client segmentation last quarter i talked about our two new branded client experiences within retail schwab private client services and schwab private wealth services for our millionplus and millionplus clients respectively this is all about delivering differentiated experiences across relationship service operations product and price the launch has been very wellreceived by our clients this quarter ill talk more about our trader offer traders are one of our most highly engaged client segments on average compared to nontrader retail clients they bring in times the nna and have times the household assets and generate times higher roca were continuing to invest in this offer to provide the worldclass trading experience traders expect just today we launched our reimagined trader offer schwab trading powered by ameritrade with this new experience were combining the best of schwab and ameritrade by giving all of our clients access to the thinkorswim and schwab trading platforms unparalleled trading education including many elements of ameritrades trader education offer and specialized service traders at schwab have access to all that schwab has to offer wealth management banking and more in fact our virtual active trader branch includes active trader financial consultants who focus on both trader coaching and wealth management to help meet the unique needs of qualifying traders we think this offer sets the bar for what a trading experience should be putting it all together with our through clients eyes strategy we are wellpositioned to consistently generate to organic growth from both existing and new clients and there is an opportunity ahead as we start to see returns on the investments weve made in our strategic focus areas as weve shared in prior quarters we have an opportunity to close the share of wallet gap between ameritrade and schwab clients and we have an attractive opportunity to delight our retail clients with our wealth management and to delight both our retail and advisor clients with our lending offerings while growing our revenue and ill wrap up where walt started our relentless focus on serving our clients needs creates a clear path to organic growth and delivering longterm value to our clients and stockholders and with that ill turn it over to peter the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 16oct2023 peter b crawford managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp thank you very much rick so walt and rick talked about how despite a difficult environment were continuing to earn the loyalty and trust of our clients and driving strong organic growth the enormous progress we have made with the ameritrade acquisition and the exciting potential that the combination presents for our clients and our stockholders the other significant growth opportunities were pursuing and how were working hard to capitalize on those opportunities continuing to invest in enhancing our platform even as we take steps to strengthen our industryleading cost advantage in my time today ill briefly review our third quarter financial performance update our scenario and offer some early thoughts on and beyond the important point is that in the third quarter we saw notable improvement across several tactical metrics on which there has been a lot of focus lately we might argue too much focus in the context of our ability to create value over time and im referring specifically to the pace of client cash reallocation activity our capital levels the level of supplemental borrowing and the trajectory of our net interest margin when you combine these developments with the measures walt and rick shared to demonstrate our strong business momentum it reinforces our confidence in our ability to move through this part of the economic cycle as we have so many times before and emerge from this period a larger stronger and even more resilient company as walt mentioned the third quarter was a challenging one for many of our clients and for our business model and so not surprisingly our financial performance was off last years record levels with a little under billion of revenue and of adjusted eps and yet that bottom line performance was better than the second quarter of this year and with an adjusted pretax margin of over on a gaap basis due to the large restructuring charge this quarter we are navigating from a position of strength turning our attention to the balance sheet bank deposits were down sequentially due to client cash allocation decisions but following a brief uptick in that activity in august the pace slowed dramatically in september as a result of that slowing activity we were able to further reduce the amount of supplemental funding we have outstanding we issued a little over billion in debt to supplement our parent liquidity and assuming the markets continue to be constructive we will likely issue a bit more debt primarily to build up extra liquidity ahead of some debt maturities we have early next year and our capital position continues to get even stronger with our consolidated tier leverage ratio rising to and our adjusted tier leverage ratio inclusive of aoci and therefore what our binding constraint would be if we lose the aoci optout at schwab bank now into the mid range and thats using average assets its more like today on a spot basis as it steadily climbs towards by the end of the year meaning that we will be in a position to meet the new proposed regulatory requirement organically and several years ahead of the anticipated full implementation date i know theres a lot of commentary there has been a lot of commentary about the increased client cash allocation activity in august activity which seemed to buck the clear trend of deceleration weve been experiencing over the previous several months we said at the time that it felt more like an anomaly and now having closed the books on september we have a number of tangible proof points that indicate that outflows are easing and were getting closer to the return of sweep cash growth including the fact that the overall pace of realignment activity decelerated in september to the lowest level we have seen during the current cycle and we experienced our first month of bank sweep deposit growth since before the hiking cycle started and both the absolute number and size of client realignment events dropped further from the level we shared last quarter the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 16oct2023 and all this in spite of an increase in rates across the curve and while we saw increased flows into purchased money funds we caution you again not to use those daily flow numbers as a proxy for overall deposit flows only around of the purchased money fund purchases lately have been funded with bank sweep and schwab one with the remainder coming from equities fixed income or oftentimes money coming from outside schwab thats been attracted by our very competitive yields and low expense ratios on those funds now were now halfway through october and the trend has largely continued with overall transactional cash balances excluding again schwab one and the ida in line with the september trend despite delayed tax payments by many of our clients in california and elsewhere as we have said many times that trend is not surprising but it is encouraging and it brings greater clarity towards our core earnings power during walts and ricks sections they talked about some of the measures that demonstrate how were continuing to win with clients metrics such as client promoter score net new assets new accounts and organic growth rate the dealrelated attrition that has been lower than our initial expectations and advice flows and those are clearly the most important predictors of our longterm success and all portend a bright future but the more tactical balance sheet metrics have all trended in a positive direction as well and we believe we are well on our way towards those indicators returning to more normal levels the level of supplemental borrowing has continued to fall as the ongoing cash flow generated from our investment portfolio has been more than sufficient to support the slowing deposit bank sweep outflows and wed expect this level of temporary borrowing to drop substantially over the next handful of quarters paving the way for us to resume reinvestment activity in which assuming rates follow expectations will provide a meaningful boost to our net interest margin speaking of net interest margin assuming rates follow the dot plots we still anticipate it building through and approaching by the end of despite rising interest rates our adjusted tier leverage ratio at the banks and for the consolidated corporation rose roughly basis points during the quarter approaching the level to be considered wellcapitalized several years before that measure is slated to become our regulatory ratio and wed expect those ratios to continue to increase due to continued strong capital formation the accretion of the unrealized marks back to equity and a reduction of our balance sheet as we pay off the remaining supplemental borrowings bringing back the potential for opportunistic capital return over time so what does all this mean for the rest of this year and our outlook for this year is pretty similar to what we shared back in july as client cash allocation activity continues to abate wed still expect to see a return of transactional cash growth later this year we should see a stabilization of revenue and then a resumption of growth over time and full year revenue is expected to decline a bit more than the previously mentioned to range but ultimately trading volumes and market levels will influence how things shake out on the expense side wed still expect our adjusted expense growth to be somewhere in the 6ishpercent range inclusive of the million onetime fdic charge that of course was not contemplated when we set out our initial spending plan at the beginning of the year meaning that our other spending is tracking at least basis points below the range we communicated back in january as we adjust and optimize our expense base consistent with ricks earlier comments now turning our attention to well share specific scenarios at our winter business update but needless to say the revenue outlook will be shaped by a range of factors including of course the path of interest rates and the equity markets the pace of deposit growth and the level of client engagement but our expectation is that well make substantial progress in reducing our usage of fhlb advances and cds rick described the work were doing on the expense front and we expect that to result in adjusted expenses that are no higher than the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 16oct2023 and finally wed expect to continue to grow both our regulatory capital ratios and our adjusted tier leverage ratio boosting that latter ratio back above several years before it becomes a formal requirement there is no doubt that we have been navigating through a difficult environment but it should be apparent that the core pillars of the multidecade investment thesis for schwab are as strong today as ever we are the premier asset gatherer with industryleading client loyalty a strong competitive moat and a leadership position in the two fastestgrowing segments within wealth management we have multiple ways to convert that asset growth into revenue growth including growing advice with both schwab and ameritrade clients as well as a longterm nim tailwind as we eventually reinvest our securities portfolio at much higher prevailing rates we continue to manage expenses with discipline with billion or more of remaining expense synergies and other efficiency opportunities and we are a company that has shown the ability to couple strong organic growth with opportunistic capital return a combination which were confident will reemerge in the years ahead now admittedly that powerful combination has been obscured recently by some of the fog as walt described it back in july but this fog continues to clear with dealrelated attrition abating allowing our net new assets to return to our normal levels which are anything but client cash allocation activity slowing supplemental borrowing decreasing and our nim rebounding expense growth slowing and poised to slow further as we prepare for the significant remaining expense actions in the quarters ahead and our capital levels building despite the headwinds posed by increasing rates i talked earlier about longterm predictors of success versus more tactical nearterm metrics but when you step back to look at the whole picture you see a healthy resilient company with a lot of momentum and a lot of opportunity in front of that with that ill turn it over to jeff to facilitate our qa the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 16oct2023 question and answer section jeff edwards a managing director headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp great operator can you please remind everyone how they can queue up and ask a question and then lets go and get started operator yes thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from ken worthington with jpmorgan you may go ahead kenneth b worthington q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning thanks for taking the question so interestearning assets have declined in recent quarters you mentioned the positive deposit growth for september and on the last call you highlighted the expectation that deposits would grow later this year given your prioritization for the paydown in shortterm borrowing if current macro trends continue and the forward curve is right when would you expect to see interestearning assets trough and at about what level would you expect them to trough peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp thanks ken for the question so our expectation is that we will continue to prioritize paying down the supplemental borrowings that is the fastest way to get to that nim that we talked about by the end of so what that could mean is that we could be seeing deposits grow as transactional cash grow even as interestearning assets are declining again because our focus is really on paying down those supplemental borrowings so that would be you could see a scenario where interestearning assets are declining but nim is growing and actually net interest revenue is growing even as that is happening great thanks operator thank you our next question is from patrick moley with piper sandler you may go ahead patrick moley q analyst piper sandler co yeah thanks for taking my questions so great to see the slower cash realignment in september and appreciate the comments on the of money market fund inflows coming from customer cash but just wondering on the pickup in realignment activity in august maybe if you could elaborate on what you thought triggered that sorting and maybe the types of accounts that that was coming from and whether that number applied in the month of august it seemed like it was triggered by the rate hike in late july and maybe just sort of piggybacking off of kens question if you could maybe just talk about how youre thinking about customer behavior as it relates to realignment in the event we see a couple more rate hikes this cycle thanks peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp sure so yeah i dont recall the exact percent of the assets that were or purchased money fund balances that were coming from bank sweep what i can say is august i think was a couple of things it was in part a reaction to the feds increase in late july and some of the headlines maybe that that captured we also saw actually net the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 16oct2023 inflows into equities so theres definitely an investor sentiment aspect to it in terms of going forward i mean our expectation is that when the fed increases it has a small but decreasing and temporary impact on deposit flows if people are yieldsensitive the cash is yieldsensitive and fed fund is at theyll move it doesnt make a huge difference whether its i think its more about the headlines frankly that that creates that may prompt some people to move but i want to emphasize that a high for longer scenario is a very good scenario for schwab for our business model while in the nearterm that rate increase can lead to a little bit more in deposit activity that higher rate over the long term means more a higher yield on the roughly onethird of our interestearning assets that are tied to floating rates thats things like our margin lending and the cash the segregate cash and the cash we have at the parent the cash we have at the bank et cetera so sort of a high for longer scenario which just seems to be what were easing our way into here is it is a good scenario for us because that impact on transactional cash balances is shortlived operator thank you our next question is from brennan hawken with ubs you may go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my question peter i would appreciate if we could maybe try and square slide where you talked about the client cash realignment versus when we run through the calculation for the september monthly data based on the various cash disclosures percentage of client assets and whatnot if i adjust out the cds and the money funds out of there so just getting what should be the bank sweep bda and the brokerdealer cash indiscernible similar to a decline that we saw in july and so how do i square that with the slide does slide just not include the brokerdealer cash is that the delta can you help me understand that jeff edwards a managing director headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp hey brennan its jeff im happy to cover that off i mean it includes the same stuff it always has in terms of bank sweep plus brokerdealer balances s1 plus bda so its the same consistent view weve talked about so we can take that offline and chat about any other items that are in there but yeah this is a consistent view with the monthly and prior quarterly data operator thank you the next question is from kyle voigt with kbw you may go ahead kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning so a question for peter you issued about billion of cds in september just given the trends that youre seeing with cash sorting can you talk about expectations for the shortterm funding mix between cds and fhlb as we look out over the next couple of quarters and kind of maybe within that maybe you could kind of address how you intend to handle cd maturities going forward and then what happens if we do see another kind of reacceleration or another blip in another month going forward how you intend to how would you manage through that in terms of liquidity and where you access liquidity from thank you peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 16oct2023 sure so i would expect that were going to have a mix of cds and fhlb going forward there are advantages of each the cds today are a little bit lower cost and we like the idea of paying our clients and clients of other brokers the nice thing about the fhlb is that its very you can really dial in the maturity and get the exact amount you can also prepay fhlb so if we see a growth in deposits we have the ability to prepay those fhlb advances so id expect itd be a mix we like the fact of having a diversity of funding sources going forward but i think either way i think wed expect both of those balances collectively to trend down as i said over the next several quarters jeff edwards a managing director headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp were going to take one question here from the console operator this one lets do the one for walt walt obviously since the time we had the ameritrade approval for the deal and actually beginning the conversion was around lets say or years this timeframe is a bit longer than maybe some more other recent transactions could you talk a little bit about what drove that timeline walter w bettinger ii a cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp sure thanks jeff ive referenced in my prepared remarks about our best of both approach in which rather than following a traditional integration which is simply moving clients in the acquired firm over to the platforms of the acquiring company instead we look to bring over a series of capabilities whether its thinkorswim that i think now is available to all schwab clients as of today things like rebalancing ph pikes but maybe even to go beyond that just quickly every brokerage conversion that i am familiar with in the history of our industry involves simply bringing over account assets and then a limited amount of demographic data things like address social security numbers things like that we took a very different approach in addition to bringing over the most basic information that others would always bring over we also brought over transaction history i think i believe it was four years of history we brought over historical documents all of the documents that the client would have had at ameritrade open orders client preferences watch lists things like cash sharing and move money instructions so we just took a very different approach and i think that that is part of what has contributed to the extraordinarily low level of client complaints that we have seen as again i referenced in my prepared remarks and so i just would roll this all back into the big picture of our through clients eyes strategy that weve approached this integration that these are exceptionally important clients that we look to serve for many many years to come and despite the environment that we happen to be in make the right longterm decision its fascinating to hear all the discussion around client cash realigning because client cash realigning is cyclical but our through clients eyes strategy is not and as we work our way through the very tactical issues being raised today and the nearterm issues i think the power of schwab is going to emerge and once again reward our clients as well as our stockholders in a manner we have many many times in the past operator thank you our next question is from dan fannon with jefferies you may go ahead daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning i wanted to follow up on nna i get the outlook and the guidance and certainly september was improved can you talk about the backlog today for potential advisors and how that compares to previous periods and then with the ameritrade integration now mostly done should we not anticipate much in terms of the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 16oct2023 movement in nna as a result of that and also if you could maybe clarify on some of those outflows how much was schwabs decision to walk away from that business or client decisions richard a wurster a president the charles schwab corp sure absolutely as it relates to the backlog of advisors we continue to see a healthy pipeline in our advisor services business so no change there very robust and i think what we are seeing is a resumption of that activity for a few months around the conversion a lot of our effort and energy was put into that a lot of advisors were holding back clients that they would have brought to schwab because they didnt want them to have to go through a conversion so they held on them and now were seeing a resumption back to all normal levels of activity so thats on the backlog of advisors what was the last one oh so yeah let me talk about some of the attrition on our advisor services indiscernible came from a combination of three things number one were some relationships where it just didnt fit either for economic reasons or for services that the ria firm wanted that we werent going to provide second reason there may have been some other business reasons why it didnt make sense it used to be an advisor maybe that we had served and the relationship didnt make sense for us to serve in the future so there was a chunk of relationships where it didnt make sense for both parties for us to serve them and then there was some element of regrettable attrition clients we would have liked to have served but for a variety of reasons they chose to go somewhere else so it was a combination of those three things walter w bettinger ii a cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp i think one of the things thats very important when we talk about nna is we put it in the context of the trillion of assets that are coming over as part of this acquisition if i can remember properly from four years ago we estimated something like to asset attrition and about revenue attrition and we are substantially outperforming those numbers but the reality is to of what is now trillion is a meaningful number and so when you compare attrition from this acquisition and you apply it to monthly net new asset figures youre going to get a decline in monthly numbers its just math but as rick indicated accurately this is waning and in the ria side it was all concentrated in the couple of months before the conversion so we feel exceptionally good about where we are despite the very few rias who rick identified who did choose regrettably to go somewhere else but that was a small number overall and a significant amount of the attrition were clients that we had previously terminated relationships with who had maybe switched over to ameritrade or as i mentioned run a commissionoriented business that really doesnt fit with our model we work much better with advisors who have decided to principally go fee and get largely out of the commission side operator thank you and our next question is from steven chubak with wolfe research you may go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning so its certainly encouraging to see the capital build the nna acceleration in september i think the one element of area of concern for investors continues to be the sweep cash dynamics and while bank sweep deposits increasing in september are certainly encouraging total sweep cash was down billion for the month and peter you alluded to the fact that youre seeing similar trends in october versus september how should we interpret what the total cash sweep decline will be not exclusively the bank sweep deposits it feels the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 16oct2023 like theres some bifurcated trend between payables and bank sweep deposits hoping you can unpack that better peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah so thanks steven so im not sure where your billion figure is coming from but that is higher than what were tracking if you do the math on that page where we show the daily flow i think youre looking at a number thats about half that level so im not sure where the billion is coming from and you can maybe work that through with the ir team and so october is tracking in line with that lower number so again it just it reinforces the fact that we saw a decline from april to may and may to june and june to july and then we had this one blip in august and then september has really continued the trend and now october is consistent with september so all this reinforces our conviction that weve been saying for quite some time which is this cash reallocation activity is declining and that were seeing again in terms of the number of people who are reallocating and the size of those trades that theyre making so it all reinforces our conviction that were very close to the end of this cycle operator thank you our next question is from alex blostein with goldman sachs you may go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc thank you good morning just a quick question around the balance sheet again and some of the liquidity dynamics peter can you just frame to us how much of securities will be maturing through the end of between available for sale and htm buckets just a refresher on that and then i know you made a point about longterm debt so as you kind of work through your liquidity requirements any incremental capital changes how do you think the appropriate level of longterm debt for schwab will look like by the end of peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah so in terms of when we think about principal and interest off of the investment portfolio its tracking now at about billion or so per month so roughly billion to billion per quarter maybe a little bit more in the next quarter but somewhere in that range over the next five quarters so that provides a meaningful amount of resources liquidity to pay down those supplemental borrowings when you add that together with of course the net new assets that we attract via new accounts thats those are the two of the bigger drivers in terms of paying down those supplemental shortterm borrowings in terms of the right amount of liquidity i would think about this in terms of parent liquidity as we raise debt to keep liquidity at the parent we do that primarily to support the activity our client needs at the brokerdealers and so we have through as weve been going through these conversions we have wanted to operate with a little bit more parent liquidity given to make sure weve got ample resources through these conversion weekends and so we are running with a higher level of liquidity now than we might expect to have after we pay out and we also have these debt maturities in the early part of next year so we want to make sure weve got the funds necessary to pay off those maturities so once we get done with that well be comfortable with the level of liquidity that we have at the parent operator thank you our next question is from mike cyprys with morgan stanley you may go ahead the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 16oct2023 michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning thanks for taking the question i wanted to circle back to your commentary on the workplace business so i was hoping you could help size the business just in terms of assets and accounts how much does that represent and maybe you could talk about how much that has contributed to nna in the recent years as well as some of the steps that youre thinking about taking to broaden this client acquisition funnel over the next couple of years richard a wurster a president the charles schwab corp yeah i think as it relates to the steps were taking its an exciting opportunity for us because it increases the top of the funnel the amount of clients that could become future schwab clients for us and what were focused on is really twofold increasing that top of the funnel bringing more and more employees into the schwab workplace business and then secondly converting them into schwab clients and so we have efforts going along two fronts number one integrating the business and tying it more into schwab so the experience leverages all that schwab has to offer our retail mobile site our retail website our branches all of those capabilities that we can bring to bear for the workplace clients if we do that successfully well convert a greater number of our workplace clients into longterm schwab clients and when we do that as i shared earlier they bring times the assets that they have through the workplace business and then the second thing we need to do is we need to win more of the employeebased businesses at the top of the funnel and thats why were investing in the experience and the technology around it so the business has the potential i think to add a lot more to our nna going forward than it does today and were quite excited about the prospects operator thank you our next question is from brian bedell with deutsche bank you may go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks a lot of my questions were answered maybe just one on the securities portfolio the aoci the improved or the stability there is that entirely due to the accretion of the unrealized marks getting paid down or is hedging the securities portfolio playing a substantial part of that peter b crawford a managing director chief financial officer the charles schwab corp yeah no thanks brian no thats mostly the or i should say that really is the impact of the accretion of those marks back to par they are with the duration on our available for sale portfolio of just over two years youre looking at roughly 600ish million per quarter in terms of amortization so thats even in a flat rate scenario so thats really whats going on there jeff edwards managing director headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp im just doing a time check here looking maybe were up on the top of the hour here peter do you want to maybe close with some of those final remarks the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update
