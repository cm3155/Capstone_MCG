management discussion section jeff edwards managing director headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp good morning everyone and welcome to schwabs fall business update this is jeff edwards head of investor relations and im joined today by a slightly larger contingent of esteem presenters including co chairman and ceo walt bettinger president rick wurster new cfo mike verdeschi and managing director peter crawford today is certainly a little bittersweet as the team is certainly excited to provide their perspective about all the exciting things happening at schwab right now but today also marks the final business update for walt and peter i dont believe im going too far out on a limb to say that were all going to miss having both of them in the room with us each quarter especially walt who has helped set the energy and pace for these business updates for well over a decade and a half im certainly going to reach out to mr fowler to see if hes still planning on hosting quarterly business update watch parties for those former schwabies who are enjoying from his undisclosed location given the larger group today we should have a familiar but slightly different cadence to the session walt will kick things off with some opening remarks and then he and rick who will be stepping into the ceo role come january will provide insights around our clients and overall strategic picture and then given the recent cfo transition at the beginning of the month we thought it made sense to allocate the financial update between peter who will focus on results and mike who will touch on our thinking as we enter the final stretch for and then this time around we will save a few extra minutes at the end for some closing remarks from walt some quick housekeeping reminders the slides for todays business update will be posted to their usual spot on the ir website at the end of the prepared remarks qa remains structured as the one question no follow ups and lets be mindful of those multipart questions that we certainly encourage anyone to reenter the queue if another question comes to mind and as always please dont hesitate to follow up with ir with any additional questions and finally the thread that links us all together through the years the eternal wall of words regarding our forward looking statements reminding us that the future is indeed uncertain so please stay in touch with our disclosures and with that walt please start us off walter william bettinger cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp thank you jeff and good morning everyone thanks for joining us for our october business update ive had the honor of speaking with all of you at these updates dating back to when i assumed responsibility for our investor services or retail business of course as jeff indicated going forward in my role as executive cochair i wont be participating in these calls so i want to take a moment and thank all of you for your interest your thoughtful questions as well as the insights you shared with me over the years through all the ups and downs the changing economic and competitive environments lead to ive always respected your professionalism and integrity so thank you the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 15oct2024 so lets go ahead and dive right into our discussion the third quarter was an important quarter for us during this transition year some might refer to it as an inflection point although only time will tell on that perspective nevertheless rick peter mike and i have a series of positive developments to share with you today in the quarter we made strong progress across virtually all key areas former ameritrade clients are continuing to generate positive net new assets thats the second quarter in a row our clients are growing transactional sweep cash balances weve made meaningful progress in paying down supplemental funding were experiencing ongoing strengthening in firmwide net new assets clients are enrolling into our retail advisory solutions at record levels all these facts along with other key metrics illustrate the health of the franchise and fuel our solid optimism for the future the third quarter did see some choppiness in the markets overall our clients remained solidly engaged and we continue to make progress on key areas of focus across the firm which rick will spend some more time on i think at this point any questions about our longterm growth trajectory should seemingly be fading during the quarter inflation eased and as the fed began to lower interest rates equity markets responded by reaching alltime highs investor sentiment remained bullish during the quarter overall trading activity was solid including some modest softening late in the quarter as our traders digested the future of rates as well as an equity market at alltime highs client engagement was quite healthy across our full spectrum of capabilities whether it be trading banking services advisory solutions custody for rias as well as asset management for the quarter trades were up about from the prior quarter while margin balances grew over billion to end at billion managed investing or retail advisory flows broke another record totaling billion during the third quarter net new assets were also quite strong during what is sometimes a slower quarter given that the summer months are included net new assets more than doubled from the third quarter of last year as former ameritrade clients continued to generate positive albeit still modest net asset flows and during the quarter clients entrusted us with almost million new brokerage accounts slide here is particularly important for those who track our net new assets closely and have been trying to ascertain our progress back to our longterm track record of to organic growth when we acquired ameritrade we recognized that we would be benefiting from a onetime large lift in client assets but along with it would be the noise of attrition that we estimated at to of assets ultimately applied to nearly a trillion client base what we saw during the third quarter as more of that attrition faded into the rearview mirror was that yeartodate net new assets for this year crossed over the trajectory of net new assets in we all know that net new asset levels can be fickle as multiple factors influence them from investor sentiment to market performance interest rates and even the level of promotional cash for assets temporarily offered by some competitors but when we dig through the various factors that do influence net new assets we remain quite confident in our plans to build our way back to our historical ranges this confidence is further supported by the response from former ameritrade clients as these clients become more familiar with the schwab platforms and service experience we are seeing an increase in client promoter scores or client satisfaction whether it be retail or ria clients the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 15oct2024 their engagement across the business in our various solutions is further evidence of the success of the integration and consistent with our best of both approach to the ameritrade integration legacy schwab clients are now taking advantage of the thinkorswim trading platform at a robust level consistent with prior years we continue to be recognized by a variety of thirdparty sources for our quality of services our overall client offering as well as our reputation we were particularly proud of the fact that investors business daily named schwab bank as the most trusted bank given the negative press and at times misperceptions regarding our bank over the past months we were especially pleased with this particular result rick let me turn it over to you to review some more details of our progress serving clients and building the franchise and ill close this out as jeff indicated after the qa session with just a few final observations richard a wurster president the charles schwab corp thank you walt and good morning everyone picking up on where walt left off weve been able to achieve this industry recognition because our through clients eyes approach remains the foundation of our strategy and it will continue to drive our longterm growth through the cycle in the near term we deliver for clients through our four strategic focus areas and in the third quarter we advanced initiatives in each area that you see on the screen starting with scale and efficiency weve captured of our ameritrade run rate expense synergies and expect to capture the rest by the end of the year in an industry where pricing matters to clients having a lowcost position is a huge competitive advantage one were committed to maintaining with our cost discipline and ongoing investments in our operations and infrastructure were continuing to lower our cost to serve clients in todate our adjusted expense on client assets or eoca fell to basis points down from basis points in our second focus area is winwin monetization which is all about how we attract and retain assets by meeting more of our clients evolving financial needs wealth management is one of our key areas of focus and clients continue to turn to us for advice across the spectrum of our solutions yeartodate managed investing net flows are up compared to last year in the third quarter new and existing clients added billion to our full service wealth offers which include schwab wealth advisory and schwab advisor network this is more than the prioryear quarter clients continue to turn to schwab wealth advisory in record numbers we also recently began introducing a discretionary option for schwab wealth advisory clients which will help us meet even more of the comprehensive wealth management needs of investors clients continue to have strong interest in our other wealth offerings including our wasmer schroeder fixed income strategies where yeartodate net flows are up nearly compared to last year clients are also increasingly turning to us for their borrowing needs powering strong growth and adoption of our pledged asset line or pal pal balances reached a record billion an increase of over last year notably former ameritrade clients represent of pal balance growth our account originations are up yearoveryear and we expect if rates fall the amount drawn on the pal will increase the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 15oct2024 the increased adoption is in large part due to the digital enhancements that weve made to the process nearly of pals are now digitally originated and more than of retail applications are now initiated by a financial consultant compared to less than just a few years ago this makes it easier on our clients and helps fcs deepen relationships with our clients the entire process from the time a client opens an application to when they can access their loan takes on average just business days and only minutes for most loans this industry leading offer is delighting our clients and client promoter scores have increased roughly percentage points in this product since with client segmentation were focused on serving distinct retail and advisor client groups with tailored solutions specific to their unique needs rias have been and remain an incredibly important client segment for schwab we have the same goal as the rias we serve can make a meaningful difference in the financial lives of our clients and we are committed to continuing to help our advisors grow compete and succeed in pursuit of this mission we have a worldclass custody business and well continue to invest in it to provide rias of all sizes with the open architecture platform and unmatched resources services and education that they have come to expect from us im thrilled to have the opportunity to dive into this in more detail at our upcoming impact conference next month turning to our retail business we know that relationships matter and were investing to give more of our clients access to a dedicated financial consultant our ultra high net worth clients have been a particular area of focus as they have some of the most complex financial planning and wealth management needs among our client base weve added additional expertise for this group including wealth consultants and tax trust and estate experts weve also enhanced our approach to service and operations for this client group all of which has been well received by clients as evidenced by their high client promoter scores we plan to launch retail alternatives to this client segment this quarter which will be an important milestone for clients traders are another distinct and very important client segment for us i believe that the combination of schwab and ameritrade has produced the strongest trader offer in the industry and we are continuing to enhance our capabilities including investments in our mobile experience our platform and our research and education our fourth strategic area is the brilliant basics with the size of our client base the most attractive opportunity we have for growth is to delight our existing clients with every interaction they have with us so that they trust us with more of their assets conduct more of their financial lives here at schwab and refer others to us because we are delivering each day on the client experience in our retail business our average speed to answer the phone was less than seconds in the third quarter yeartodate through the third quarter the client easy score for our service teams is thats the highest score weve earned from clients in four years and the vast majority of incoming calls are addressed without the need to transfer the client call in advisor services our client easy score which is the clients real time rating of how easy it was to complete a specific task or transaction was in the third quarter and in our workplace business we were ranked number one by jd power in participant satisfaction for our retirement plan digital experiences the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 15oct2024 im confident in our ability to deliver for clients today and im energized by the opportunity to do even more as we look ahead and as we look to the future not just next quarter or next year but through the cycle and for the long term through clients eyes will remain the foundation of our strategy through clients eyes means we will relentlessly focus on serving the needs of individual investors workplace clients in rias and the clients that they serve through clients eyes is what will continue to drive the virtuous cycle and fuel our growth well into the future as we invest in the brilliant basics scale and efficiency and serving more of our clients needs across client segments i do want to take just a moment here to express my gratitude to walt for his vision his leadership his focus on our clients and the integrity and selflessness in which he has led our company that vision is not changing as he transitions into his new role as cochairman and i move into my new role as ceo in the new year im grateful to be stepping into this role in a period when our client capabilities have never been stronger and we are operating from a position of strength and with that ill turn it over to peter peter b crawford managing director the charles schwab corp all right well thank you very much rick so walt and rick talked about the strong engagement were seeing among our clients as they utilize our broad wealth management and trading capabilities our success in attracting assets and accounts from both existing and new clients the encouraging signs were seeing that fuel our confidence about returning to our historical growth levels and our progress and plans do just that as we execute on our four strategic priorities that rick talked about in this my final time addressing you today and mikes inaugural business update he and i will review our very solid and improving financial performance in the third quarter which was somewhat better than we expected heading into the quarter well provide an update on the latest developments regarding our clients cash realignment activity and how that enabled us to make progress in paying down bank supplemental borrowing and well share an updated outlook for  earnings and some very early thoughts on the important point is that we near the end of what we repeatedly called a transitional year we know we havent yet reached our traditional level of organic growth or peak financial performance and yet we feel really good about the progress we have made further unlocking the core earnings power that has been building through this whole cycle but which has been masked by other factors and reinvigorating our longterm financial formula with ameritraderelated attrition receding and ceasing to be a major drag in our organic growth our continued moderation of client cash realignment activity which allowed for sequential growth in client transactional cash in the third quarter due to strong net inflows during september sequential growth in both net interest revenue and overall revenue and finally a steady and continued increase in our capital levels inclusive of aoci and while we all appreciate the uncertain nature of the world we live in our positive momentum sets the stage for what we expect will be even better operating and financial performance in the quarters and years ahead as walt mentioned has been characterized by strong equity markets and consistent client engagement we saw that reflected in external benchmarks such as the sp and nasdaq as well as key drivers of our business performance including margin balances now up from the end of trading activity in the third quarter that was up modestly from the second quarter the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 15oct2024 and as rick mentioned a continuation of the very strong interest among clients for our advisory solutions and finally client cash realignment activity continues to decelerate enabling strong growth in overall client cash and transactional cash for the quarter and especially robust growth in the month of september now while weve repeatedly cautioned against overreacting to a specific months or even quarters transactional cash flows this recent activity is further evidence that we are at or near truly transactional levels of client cash enabling us to pay down a meaningful amount to supplemental borrowing at the banks and creating a good launching off point for  as mike will discuss in a moment now that backdrop helps support solid financial performance in the third quarter that exceeded our expectations with revenue up yearoveryear to billion adjusted pretax income up a similar amount an adjusted pre tax margin of little over and adjusted eps of now before i turn over to mike i want to make two brief comments first i want to join walt and thanking all of you within the investment community for your engagement and your interest over these last several years i firmly believe that the rigor the discipline and the transparency you demand of us makes us a better company and second i want to thank mike here for allowing me to step down from the cfo role with a confidence that between him and rick this company i care so much about is in great hands its really been a real privilege working with mike these last several months and ill continue to do what i can to help over the coming months he has already added a lot in his time here leveraging his very relevant experience and exceptional judgment and finally and importantly he connects with our purpose and his values align with the companys values and with that its my pleasure to turn the floor over to mike michael verdeschi chief financial officer managing director the charles schwab corp thank you peter and congratulations on your welldeserved retirement ive certainly enjoyed working with you and the broader management team to get up to speed these past few months youve been an outstanding leader for the firm with many contributions over the years which have had a positive and lasting impact on our clients and employees as i mentioned back in may at investor day there are so many exciting things happening around schwab so i feel very fortunate to be stepping into this role right now and i look forward to working with rick and the rest of our teams as we continue to serve the needs of our growing client base lets take it up with the summary of key balance sheet highlights for the quarter importantly we continue to support our clients with both margin and bank loans to clients up sequentially as peter alluded to earlier we saw a healthy rebound in transactional sweep cash during the quarter including billion of net inflows in september this positive development in cash enabled us to reduce high cost supplemental funding at the banks by billion at the same time we also continued to take proactive steps at the broker dealer to both support sustained client activity in areas such as margin lending and further diversify our funding profile those actions included transferring billion of client cash sweep balance to the broker dealer bringing the total yeartodate transfer to billion this allows us to align funding where its needed to support the large and the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 15oct2024 growing activity of our former ameritrade clients we also activated some efficient clientrelated wholesale funding at the broker dealer to again serve the needs of our growing client base especially those that tend to trade and utilize margin loans more frequently this wholesale funding has very little impact on our net interest revenue because the funds we take on are deployed into cash which earns a fairly similar rate the net result of these actions is increased flexibility to meet the evolving needs of clients while continuing to achieve our financial objectives such as paying down supplemental borrowings at the bank and ensuring growth in earnings finally our capital levels continue to build towards our adjusted tier leverage objective driven by a few factors first quarterly earnings then the accretion of unrealized marks which occurs at a pace of around billion per quarter regardless of changes in interest rates and lastly an incremental tailwind in  from the move lower in interest rates of course this rate related impact will vary over time based on fluctuations in interest rates across the curve turning to client cash trends the trends in transactional sweep were quite encouraging for the third quarter with total sweep cash balances growing billion including a billion net inflow during the month of september this result reflects the continued slowdown of raterelated realignment activity cash trends during september also benefited from anticipated seasonal trends as well moving forward its important to keep in mind that while cash trends do not move in a straight line monthover month we anticipate making further progress over time ultimately resulting in cash balances growing in proportion with client accounts and assets so while we will continue to monitor factors that can influence the trajectory of cash such as interest rates investor engagement as well as seasonality these encouraging trends help support our strategy and momentum into the end of the year the cash trends also positioned us to make incremental progress on reducing the amount of outstanding supplemental funding at the banks we reduced the balances by billion from the june level to just under billion at the end of the third quarter supplemental funding balances are now down over from peak levels back in may further pay down progress remains a priority as cash as well as principal and interest proceeds from the bank securities portfolio continue to be key drivers in paying down borrowings the exact timing for achieving our pay down goal will also be influenced by some of the same factors that we see in our transactional cash trends over the near term continuing to reduce the amount of supplemental funding outstanding is a key driver in achieving normalized earnings power and we expect to show continued progress from here turning our attention to capital lower rates supported our pace of capital build during the quarter with our adjusted tier leverage ratio expanding by over basis points to we are quickly approaching our to operating objective despite the recent back up in rates to start the fourth quarter we still expect to finish above the lower bound of the objective range as we begin we will start to pivot from what has been a focus on building our capital ratios inclusive of aoci to looking across our capital framework as always our number one priority for capital is to support the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 15oct2024 business growth to the extent we have excess capital beyond our business needs we have sought throughout our history to return it to stockholders through a variety of means including a common dividend which historically has risen alongside gaap earnings preferred security redemptions considering costs and an optimized equity funding mix as well as opportunistic stock buybacks but as we have previously noted in the near term there is an added consideration relating to our progress on reducing the highcost supplemental funding at the banks while this action is not a return of capital per se liquidity which otherwise could support capital buybacks may instead be used to pay down supplemental borrowings following our third quarter results we now anticipate fullyear revenue to increase by to versus this is slightly above the range that was communicated back in july due to a higher starting balance for transactional cash balances and reduced supplemental funding balances at the bank adjusted expense growth for fullyear is still expected to be approximately inclusive of certain non controllable items outlined earlier in the year combining this refresh perspective on top line growth with an expense trajectory that reflects the benefits of our scale and ongoing efficiency initiatives implies earnings expanding further into the upper range for the fourth quarter a bit above the level we communicated back in july before we wrap up lets spend a moment on we are right in the middle of our planning cycle so we wont get too far ahead of ourselves especially with the upcoming presidential election and two fomc meetings where the rate path remains uncertain however we thought it might be helpful to briefly touch on a few items that are helping inform our thinking heading into next year as noted we anticipate coming into with good momentum and expected to further build in the year ahead with of course the usual considerations for shifts in the macroeconomic backdrop interest rates market sentiment seasonality too while nim should continue to expand even in a lower rate environment the ultimate level will be influenced by a range of factors including the path of rates which is now much lower than back in july on the expense front consistent with the companys historical approach we will balance making investments to support sustainable longterm growth while also delivering on the firms nearterm financial objectives keeping that balanced approach in mind yearoveryear expense growth in the midsingle digits still feels like a reasonable starting point for now while acknowledging that changes in the broader environment client activity typical seasonality and other key factors will undoubtedly shape our expenses plenty of opportunities to discuss these topics a few months from now as we approach the end of its hard not to be excited about the opportunity in front of us momentum with clients continues to strengthen while our financial results put us in a position to deliver meaningful earnings power expansion as the combination of our diversified revenue model and a balanced approach to expense management yields profitable growth which we believe will be amplified by our capital efficiency through the cycle and with that its time for some qa jeff back to you jeff edwards managing director headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 15oct2024 operator can you please help outline the qa process for the group question and answer section operator absolutely operator instructions our first question comes from ken worthington from jpmorgan please go ahead kenneth b worthington q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning thank you for taking the question you reported a substantial improvement in transactional sweep cash and deposits this quarter i would love to better understand what drove this change in september compared particularly to august and earlier quarter levels given september nna was similar in september to august levels and given the ameritrade flows are positive but still modest and were seeing fund and etf buying similar again in september to august levels what is really driving the better or what really drove the better transactional cash in september and is this the beginning of a better outlook or is september really just a one off michael verdeschi a chief financial officer managing director the charles schwab corp let me address that with talking about the quarter in the quarter we did see organic growth of cash and i would say we also saw some of the variability that we typically see in client activity as they engage us so as you highlight we did see that pick up in september but over the course of the quarter as weve been saying this is further evidence of that realignment activity normalizing so a combination of organic growth and some of that variability as well so we feel good about this progress and again this is going to be one of the keys in addition to obviously taking on the principal and interest payments that come out of the securities portfolio in combination using those proceeds could make further progress on paying down the supplemental borrowings operator next well go to the line of alex blostein from goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hi good morning everybody thanks for the question and congrats to you all on your next respective chapters i wanted to ask mike you just your thoughts around how youre thinking about the securities portfolio given the fact that the cash seems to be stabilizing a bit and the capital is rebuilding thats come up a number of times in the past as well but obviously financially paying down securities a bit ahead of schedule to reduce fhlb and td balances makes sense but curious how youre thinking about any kind of holistic securities portfolio restructuring as you enter michael verdeschi a chief financial officer managing director the charles schwab corp sure well that remains certainly a popular topic within the investment community and we appreciate that question but it is something that were not currently pursuing and as we said in the past we do not want to create unnecessarily headline risk that could disrupt our trusted relationship with clients and i think an important factor that were looking at is again that ability to continue to make progress in paying down that supplemental the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 15oct2024 funding at the bank and so we do have an analysis we keep that analysis fresh of looking at what a restructuring could entail but for the reasons that i mentioned not at this time and the key factor that were focused on is the progress of paying down that supplemental funding operator thank you next well go to the line of brennan hawken from ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs investment bank good morning thanks for taking my question mike i believe you said midsingledigit expense growth was an early expectation for just wanted to clarify would that be before the averaging in of the efficiencies that were realized through the year in and would it exclude onetime items such as the fdic and other charges in michael verdeschi a chief financial officer managing director the charles schwab corp sure so that does that is inclusive of that restructuring from this year so again that midsingledigit is going to reflect really our intent to ensure we have resources made available to continue to invest in our capabilities so we are a growth company so that is going to be important that we have sustainable investment in our firm while at the same time were going to be demonstrating discipline in that expense deployment ensuring that were meeting our financial objectives so it does include those components operator thank you next well go to the line of dan fannon from jefferies please go ahead daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning question on organic growth which those trends continue to improve but it does seem like ameritrade clients continue to be somewhat of a drag can you talk about how you see that normalizing or when you see that normalizing and then also update us on the backlog currently for new advisors potentially joining the platform richard a wurster a president the charles schwab corp sure let me start with our organic growth so overall when we look at the schwab our schwabonly clients or legacy clients of schwab the growth with our legacy schwab clients remains in that to growth range that we historically had seen as it relates to ameritrade clients were going through what is a natural process of ameritrade clients coming to schwab joining our platform and realizing how much they love it our flows from ameritrade clients have outperformed our expectations walt shared earlier the expected level of attrition that we thought we would see weve seen less than that weve outperformed that and for two quarters in a row weve begun to see former ameritrade clients contribute positively to net new assets so our expectation is that over time as those clients become more familiar with our platform get comfortable with it as we build a relationship with those clients because i think thats a big difference between some of what they would have experienced at ameritrade and what theyre experiencing now as part of schwab is the relationship element of what we do the service part of what we do the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 15oct2024 as they get to experience that we believe they will contribute more net new assets over time and grow into the level that we see from our schwab clients so we do expect that that our longterm growth trajectory will continue we expect our ameritrade clients to continue to grow their net new assets at the firm as theyve done the last two quarters and importantly all signs that were seeing with our ameritrade clients suggest that our relationship model is working and if you look at our record flows into our wealth area a significant portion over a third of the flows are coming from former ameritrade clients and if you look at our lending capabilities half of new originations in our pledged asset line half of the growth came from former ameritrade clients so the push to put our arms around these ameritrade clients help them in their financial life just as weve done for schwab clients is working and our expectation is that you can youll see over the longterm our growth in the range that youve seen it at schwab operator thank you our next question comes from kyle voigt from kbw please go ahead kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning so you seem to be on track to be at the high end or even above your tier leverage target by year end however you reiterated this quarter that you want to make more progress on the repayment of supplemental borrowing before restarting share repurchases im just wondering if you could provide more color as to whether theres a certain level of supplemental borrowing at which youd feel comfortable executing on buybacks or if theres a certain level of tier leverage above your target where you would be comfortable executing on buybacks even without substantially making more progress on repayment of supplemental borrowings michael verdeschi a chief financial officer managing director the charles schwab corp so just to reiterate then thank you for the question paying down supplemental borrowings is very high priority obviously weve had some good progress this quarter we want to continue to make that progress and we really want to get those levels down much more meaningfully really get it down to that more permanent level which is going to be modest at very most so we have more work to do there were certainly encouraged by the cash trends that weve seen which will be an important driver of that pay down of supplemental borrowings and so we need to continue to see that sustained progress i wouldnt say there is an exact amount in mind its going to be a function of the broader environment as well and yes weve made good progress on the growth of that capital as you alluded to and that has been a combination of the earnings growth that weve seen so that organic growth you also have that accretion component as well from the securities portfolio and this quarter you did see some increase due to the variability in interest rates and thats a component keep in mind that will continue to play out over time but it then gets back to our capital framework to the extent we have capital over and above whats needed to support our firm and i want to make that point very clear the capital that we have is there to support our firm and to grow our strategy beyond that and beyond paying down supplemental borrowings then we look to our capital framework where we will look at an opportunity to return capital to shareholders and that could come in a variety of forms it could be through common dividends where historically weve been at to of gaap earnings but well also look at preferred securities outstanding and look to see when they are callable and make a decision whether that capital is needed and whether we wish to call them or not the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 15oct2024 and then beyond that we would look to buybacks so i think the when i think about capital were going to continue to ensure that the capital is available for our growth we have this different consideration this time around with paying down supplemental borrowings and then beyond that well look to our capital framework operator thank you next well go to the line of steven chubak from wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning so first off congrats walt and peter thank you for all of your insights over the years mike i did want to ask you on the funding strategy you touched on it a bit in your prepared remarks but i was hoping you could just speak to changes to your funding approach just trying to understand whether there is a funding arbitrage from raising wholesale borrowings at the broker dealer versus the bank and just help quantify the increase in borrowings at the broker dealer just trying to get a better or more holistic funding picture if you will across the firm given there seem to be some different moving pieces at the bank versus the broker dealer here michael verdeschi a chief financial officer managing director the charles schwab corp hi steve and thank you for the question so that funding at the broker dealer is certainly an efficient source of funds and it is important that we diversify our sources of funding that is just a general practice that we want to have here its a capability we want to have and its efficient in that the i would think of it as prepositioning funding that we are then subsequently placing in cash and earning a roughly equivalent yield that is very efficient and gives us the flexibility to meet the evolving needs of our client in the broker dealer with the completion of the ameritrade acquisition we have a growing client base we have a client base thats dynamic in how they engage us through margin lending and that type of broker dealer funding is very efficient in meeting that evolving need and it allows us to also achieve the financial outcomes that we want to achieve which is that growth of earnings that were focused on as well i think more broadly when i think about funding across the firm i talk about diversified sources of funding and thats the bank as well as the nonbank the broker dealer and that could be in a variety of forms it could be secured and unsecured in shortterm and longterm programs so its really about creating a construct and having a framework that allows us to have flexibility to meet our client needs while at the same time ensuring that were driving financial outcomes as well operator thank you for the next question well go to brian bedell from deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning and also congrats for to walt peter and rick and welcome mike my question just goes back to the deposits obviously a fantastic result for september i guess and i know months and months can be noisy of course but do you expect some reversion of that ie some deployment of that surge in deposits as we sort of move into october and then similarly that growth over the longterm that you outlined mike is that do you think well be able to still exit with a nim of given the forward curve or is that simply just lower and do you have a view of what that might be given the lower forward curve the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 15oct2024 walter william bettinger a cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp thanks brian let me address the cash part again i know mikes already addressed it but let me just make a quick comment there and ill turn over to mike to talk about the nim we have cautioned for a long time an excessive focus on monthly cash movements because you can simply have a one day difference making a huge impact in a monthly number depending on when fixed income maturities mature although the numbers are big if you look at these numbers as a percentage of a trillion client base theyre actually quite quite modest and so the right way to look at it is at a quarter not at a month and we feel very good about where we ended up for the quarter i dont think there is anything unique or oneoff in the results for the quarter and thats why we feel confident about the fact that we continue to make progress in building of our balance sheet cash and anticipate that as we move forward taking into account the seasonality that mike previously referenced mike let me turn it over to you for nim michael verdeschi a chief financial officer managing director the charles schwab corp thank you walt and sure theres been a lot of focus on nim and that previous outlook of nim approaching by the end of that endpoint december if you will that was informed by a rate path from earlier in the year that was much higher than the rate path that we see and say todays dot plot so its reasonable to expect with that much lower expected rate trajectory for nim to be modest modestly below that approaching level that we talked about for the end of but whats important to convey is that even in that lower expectation for rates that we expect to continue to expand net interest margin in and a key driver of that is going to be our confidence in making that sustained progress in reducing that high cost supplemental funding at the bank and so what were talking about for fourth quarter is nim into the well into the and importantly further meaningful expansion in as well now well be back in january as we typically do with the financial scenario at that time between now and then we have two more fomc meetings where the outcome of those meetings still remains uncertain in terms of their decisioning so well have more information between now and january when well come back to you and talk more about nim at that time jeff edwards a managing director headinvestor relations the charles schwab corp great thanks operator i think we have time for one final question operator and for our last question well go to the line of michael cyprys from morgan stanley please go ahead michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning and thanks for taking the question just wanted to ask about the ria custody business curious how youre thinking about opportunities for expanding your offering and solutions over time for the ria custody side and what opportunities might be there to enhance monetization i know historically youve not charged a custody fee and what sort of scenario could that might make sense thanks the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 15oct2024 richard a wurster a president the charles schwab corp thanks for the question michael let me talk a little bit about our advisor services business and start by just saying its been a growth powerhouse for us it continues to drive really strong net new asset formation both in terms of the rias coming onto our platform and the growth of the rias for whom we custody assets as we look at monetizing the business i think theres lots of opportunity in the future we have been trying to do more in wealth asset management and lending to support our advisors and you certainly see it our growth in all three of those areas as evidenced by some of the numbers we shared earlier rias have been asking us almost begging for us to lend to them and their clients over time because they want to work directly with us and they dont want to introduce another party into the relationship and as weve upped our game with our pledged asset line capability and some of our mortgage capabilities more and more clients are keeping their lending business with us and we expect that as rates fall well see that accelerate were also seeing on the wealth and the asset management side where our rias rely upon us in a number of different ways including our fixed income capabilities our schwab personalized indexing capabilities and a number of other areas i also think that theres more we can do for rias over time if you think about the value chain around the rias there are a number of ways in which rias spend money in their business and many of those ways are services that we could potentially provide and for which the ria would prefer to work with us because it would make their life easier those are all areas that we are exploring as it relates to custody fee we have we believe our current model works and has served the test of time we have asked rias if they would prefer a custody fee in lieu of taking a different approach and that has not been a popular idea when weve offered that to rias so we like our current model we do think theres lots of ways to monetize our position with rias and we expect to do that over time in a way that is client friendly and helps us build our business and helps the ria build their business most importantly walter william bettinger cochairman chief executive officer the charles schwab corp well thanks thanks all for dialing in and participating in our call today as i mentioned in my opening thoughts ive had the honor and the privilege to speak with many of you about schwabs results for almost years during that time i have learned so much from the thoughtful and seasoned analysts who cover our stock as well as the owners who i would regularly meet with so thank you and as i make this transition from ceo to executive cochair im especially grateful to the tens of thousands of schwabies and the millions of clients who have helped us grow during my tenure not only from an billion market cap company to something around billion but also quadruple our stock price i realized that these numbers are the lens that many will choose to look through to evaluate my time as ceo of schwab but if i could id like to go back to the very first conversation that chuck schwab had with me about the possibility of being ceo of the company someday this conversation actually happened several years before i formally became ceo and during that conversation i asked chuck this question if i do become ceo someday what would be the most important objective that you would like me to achieve during my time as ceo now i fully expected chuck to reply with maybe a certain level of client assets or client accounts maybe a level of market capitalization or even the stock price but for those of you who know chuck well you can probably suspect that his answer was none of the charles schwab corp schw corrected transcript business update call 15oct2024 those instead chuck shared that his definition of success would be if i did my part during my tenure to ensure that there would be a strong independent schwab years hence importantly because in chucks words investors need and deserve what we offer them first great service great value quality execution professional advice low cost mutual funds and etfs access to independent investment advisors and so much more and thanks to our employees our million clients and our longterm stockholders chuck has personally shared with
