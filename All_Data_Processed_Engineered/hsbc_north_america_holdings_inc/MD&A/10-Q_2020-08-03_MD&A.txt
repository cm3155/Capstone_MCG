whollyowned subsidiary of hsbc north america which is an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of hsbc husi may also be referred to in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda as we us or our economic environment the us economy deteriorated rapidly into recession during the second quarter of driven by the covid19 pandemic which resulted in disruption to business and economic activity as well as to the capital markets covid19s effects in the us and globally have been extreme and neither the magnitude nor the duration of the pandemic and its repercussions is clear unprecedented government economic intervention has likely dampened the pandemics effects but at uncertain longterm cost us gross domestic product gdp contracted at an estimated annual rate of percent in the second quarter of while the total unemployment rate increased significantly to percent at june after cutting shortterm interest rates by basis points to near zero in march and announcing various other initiatives to enhance liquidity and support the flow of credit to households and businesses the frb decided to hold shortterm interest rates steady in june and indicated it expects shortterm rates to remain unchanged until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events the impact of the covid19 pandemic on economic conditions both in the united states and abroad during the first half of has created global uncertainty about the future economic environment including the length and depth of a global recession concerns over interest rate levels energy prices domestic and global policy issues including civil unrest in the us trade policy in the us and geopolitical events as well as the implications of those events on the markets in general further add to this global uncertainty interest rate levels and energy prices in combination with global economic conditions fiscal and monetary policy and the level of regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in and beyond performance developments and trends as mentioned above the covid19 pandemic continues to cause disruption to our customers vendors and employees the outbreak of this virus has disrupted global financial markets and negatively affected supply and demand across a broad range of industries this pandemic has had a significant impact on our business financial condition and results of operations during the first half of the year including the impairment of goodwill associated with our retail banking and wealth management and private banking reporting units in the first quarter an increase to the provision for credit losses on our loan portfolio and valuation losses associated with certain financial instruments due to market volatility which have largely recovered during the second quarter additionally in april fitch changed the rating outlook for both hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa to negative from stable and in may standard and poors sp downgraded the long and shortterm issuer credit ratings of hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa by one notch following similar rating actions for hsbc the circumstances around this pandemic are evolving and will continue to impact our business in future periods as it may not be fully contained for an extended period of time should the current economic conditions persist or deteriorate further we expect that this environment will continue to adversely impact our business which could include but not be limited to further impacts on our income due to lower interest rates lower lending and transaction volumes higher expected credit losses lower wealth management revenue due to equity markets volatility and weakness and increased model risk including credit loss models capital models and assetliability management models due to the unprecedented impact on economic and market drivers related to the covid19 pandemic other potential risks include the impact of postponed health screenings on the wellbeing of our employees credit rating migration which could negatively impact our riskweighted assets and capital position and potential liquidity stress due among other factors to increased customer drawdowns notwithstanding the significant initiatives that the us government and the frb have put in place to support funding and liquidity this matter could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects liquidity financial condition results of operations and credit ratings in future periods the extent of such impact will depend on the outcome of certain developments including but not limited to the duration of the pandemic given that the pandemic may not be fully contained until a vaccine andor widely accepted treatment becomes available which might not occur for an extended period of time as well as its continuing impact on our customers vendors and employees all of which are uncertain see part ii item risk factors risks related to the impact of covid19 for further discussion late in the second quarter of we decided to lift the pause we had put in place in march on the staff reductions relating to our restructuring plan as covid19 restrictions have begun to ease as a result we recorded million of severance related costs during the second quarter including million of direct costs and million of allocated costs from hsbc technology services htsu our restructuring plan is moving forward as planned including consolidation of our retail branch network and wholesale and retail middle and back office functions each under a single operations structure and the creation of our wealth and personal banking business which was completed in the second quarter while we remain committed to our multiyear strategic plan to reprofile our business the timing of the strategic actions as outlined in our form 10k may be resequenced or delayed beyond months as the circumstances around the covid19 pandemic continue to develop we continue to reassess our strategic plan and may take additional actions in future periods see note strategic initiatives in the accompanying consolidated financial statements hsbc usa inc

with income of million and million during the three and six months ended june respectively income loss before income tax was income of million and a loss of million during the three and six months ended june respectively compared with income of million and million during the three and six months ended june respectively the decrease in income loss before income tax during the three and six months ended june was due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic and in the yeartodate period higher operating expenses driven by a goodwill impairment charge recorded during the first quarter of as discussed below also contributing to the decrease in the yeartodate period was lower net interest income during the first quarter of as a result of the deterioration in economic conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic and the amount of headroom calculated in our previous annual impairment test for certain reporting units we determined that an interim goodwill impairment test should be performed for all of our reporting units as of march and prepared updated cash flow projections for each reporting unit resulting in a reduction in the longterm forecasts of profitability for both our retail banking and wealth management and our private banking reporting units as compared to the prior year forecasts we completed our interim impairment test of goodwill utilizing cash flow projections based on these forecasts under a present value approach and in conjunction with valuation estimates determined under a market approach concluded that the fair value of our commercial banking reporting unit exceeded its carrying value including goodwill however the cash flow projections for our retail banking and wealth management and our private banking reporting units were significantly lower which in conjunction with valuation estimates under a market approach and in consideration of a challenging macroeconomic outlook resulted in a fair value that was significantly lower than their book values including goodwill as a result we recorded a noncash impairment charge of million in the first quarter of representing the entire amount of goodwill previously allocated to these reporting units beginning in the second quarter of our retail banking and wealth management and our private banking reporting units are being reported together within a newly created wealth and personal banking segment for segment reporting purposes as discussed in our form 10k our goodwill impairment testing is highly sensitive to certain assumptions and estimates used we will continue to monitor changes to our business forecasts as we continue to perform periodic analysis of the risks and strategies of our business and product offerings if further deterioration in economic and credit conditions a change in the strategy or performance of our business or product offerings or an increase in the capital requirements of our business occurs interim goodwill impairment tests could again be required which may result in an impairment charge for additional discussion of the results of our interim goodwill impairment testing see note goodwill in the accompanying consolidated financial statements our reported results in all periods were impacted by certain items management believes to be significant which affect comparability between periods significant items are excluded to arrive at adjusted performance because management would ordinarily identify and consider them separately to better understand underlying business trends the following table summarizes the impact of these significant items for all periods presented three months ended june six months ended june in millions income loss before income tax as reported goodwill impairment costs to achieve severance costs adjusted performance reflects costs related to the delivery of the strategic plan we announced in february to restructure our operations restructuring plan as discussed further in executive overview in mda in our form 10k costs to achieve primarily consisted of lease impairment and other related costs severance costs allocated costs from htsu and trading losses associated with the exit of certain derivative contracts see note strategic initiatives in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of these costs the expense during the six months ended june also includes a million gain on the sale of one of our owned retail branch properties reflects severance costs associated with a global effort aimed to rightsize our cost base represents a nonus gaap financial measure excluding the impact of the items in the table above our adjusted performance during the three and six months ended june decreased million and million compared with prior year periods due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses hsbc usa inc driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic and in the yeartodate period lower net interest income these decreases were partially offset by lower operating expenses see results of operations for a more detailed discussion of our operating trends in addition see balance sheet review for further discussion on our asset and liability trends liquidity and capital resources for further discussion on funding and capital and credit quality for additional discussion on our credit trends london interbank offered rate libor transition regulators and central banks in various national jurisdictions continue to actively work to help transition from interbank offered rates ibors to acceptable alternative rates such as the secured overnight financing rate sofr recommended by the alternative reference rates committee arrc convened by the frb in march the fasb issued changes to the us gaap guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens associated with this transition under the new guidance an entity can elect by accounting topic or industry subtopic to account for the modification of a contract affected by reference rate reform as a continuation of the existing contract if certain conditions are met in addition the new guidance allows an entity to elect on a hedgebyhedge basis to continue to apply hedge accounting for hedging relationships in which the critical terms change due to reference rate reform if certain conditions are met we have a considerable number of contracts referencing ibors primarily libor such as loans derivatives and longterm debt extending past when the uk financial conduct authority has announced it will no longer require banks to submit rates for libor we continue to actively participate in hsbcs global transition program with the objective of facilitating an orderly transition of all products processes models and curves as well as all legacy libor contracts onto replacement rates in particular during the first half of we implemented risk disclosures for new sales of liborbased products across all of our business lines incorporated the new fallback language recommended by the arrc into new liborbased contracts for adjustable rate mortgage loans and sold substantially all of our liborlinked variable rate debt securities maturing beyond while our global businesses continue to develop their capabilities to offer alternative rate products and the supporting processes and systems the covid19 pandemic has impacted the speed at which they are able to develop these capabilities and the readiness of our customers to use alternative rate products consequently the sale of liborbased products with maturities beyond will continue for longer than initially anticipated and is likely to increase the volume of legacy contracts that will need to be transitioned in addition the covid19 pandemic has likely affected the pace at which many of our customers will have been preparing to use alternative rate products and therefore also to transition their legacy contracts onto replacement rates therefore we expect the transition of legacy contracts onto replacement rates to occur over a shortened time period in combination with the greater number of legacy contracts requiring transition this increases the overall level of execution risk on the transition process which could potentially increase the level of conduct and operational risks we are currently targeting to have pricing and dataworkflow requirements related to transitioning legacy contracts onto replacement rates finalized in the third quarter of for further discussion of our libor transition program and the associated risks see executive overview in mda in our form 10k other covid19 related developments the covid19 pandemic has significantly disrupted economic activity in many countries including the united states and the us government has taken multiple actions to mitigate the magnitude and persistence of the effects of the covid19 pandemic the united states has been operating under a presidentially declared national emergency since march in march the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act which provides financial assistance for businesses and individuals and targeted regulatory relief for financial institutions was signed into law loan forbearance initiatives the cares act created a forbearance program for federallybacked mortgage loans and provided financial institutions with the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under us gaap related to troubled debt restructurings we have currently not elected this option because of the accounting treatment otherwise afforded under the interagency statement on shortterm loan modifications discussed below the cares act also prohibits servicers of federallybacked mortgage loans from initiating any foreclosure action on any residential property that is not vacant or abandoned for a period of days beginning on march this moratorium has been extended until august in addition to these federal measures some state governments have taken action to require forbearance with respect to certain loans and fees we are continuing to monitor federal state and international regulatory developments in relation to covid19 and their potential impact on our operations in april federal banking regulators issued a revised interagency statement on loan modifications and the reporting for financial institutions working with customers affected by the covid19 pandemic interagency statement the interagency statement confirmed that covid19 related shortterm loan modifications eg payment deferrals of six months or less provided to borrowers that were current less than days past due at the time the relief was granted are not troubled debt restructurings hsbc usa inc tdr loans we are applying the guidance in the interagency statement borrowers that were not current at the time the relief was granted are assessed for tdr loan classification in accordance with our accounting policies these loans were not significant at june in addition under the interagency statement for covid19 related loan modifications in the form of a payment deferral the borrowers past due status will not be impacted during the deferral period and if the loan was accruing at the time the relief was granted the loan will generally not be placed on nonaccrual status as long as the payment deferral is for six months or less for consumer loans when a borrower requests and is provided with extended relief in the form of a payment deferral of more than six months the loan will generally be placed on nonaccrual status and assessed for tdr loan classification any accrued interest recorded on these loans is generally not reversed against income and will remain recorded as accrued interest receivable we have not modified our commercial loan nonaccrual policies as a result of this guidance we have implemented various loan modification payment deferral programs to provide borrowers relief from the economic impacts of covid19 the following table summarizes information about loans under these programs as of june not included in the following table are other forms of relief that we have provided to commercial clients affected by the impact of covid19 such as covenant waivers and amendments and deferrals of financial statement and covenant compliance reporting requirements june number of loans loan amount program details in thousands in millions commercial primarily deferrals of up to twelve months consumer residential mortgages deferrals of either three or six month increments up to a maximum of twelve months home equity mortgages deferrals of either three or six month increments up to a maximum of twelve months credit cards deferrals of either four or six months increments up to a maximum of six months other consumer deferrals of either four or six months increments up to a maximum of six months total consumer total includes approximately million of commercial loans where the borrowers were provided with extended payment deferral relief of more than six months at june none of which have been placed on nonaccrual status or classified as tdr loans consumer mortgage loans where the borrowers were provided with extended payment deferral relief of more than six months and as a result have been placed on nonaccrual status and classified as tdr loans were not significant at june when the payment relief period ends we expect to offer borrowers various options including repaying the deferred payments in full repaying the deferred payments over an installment period or moving the deferred payments to the end of the loan depending on which actions a borrower takes at the end of their relief period some of these options would result in tdr loan classification if a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty when the payment relief period ends they may enter into a modification program to reduce the interest rate and extend the term of the loan which would result in the loan being classified as a tdr loan paycheck protection program the cares act created a new loan guarantee program entitled the paycheck protection program ppp targeted to provide small businesses with support to cover payroll and certain other expenses loans made under the ppp are fully guaranteed by the small business administration sba whose guarantee is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states ppp covered loans also afford borrowers forgiveness up to the principal amount of the ppp covered loan plus accrued interest if the loan proceeds are used to retain workers and maintain payroll or to make certain mortgage interest lease and utility payments and certain other criteria are satisfied the sba will reimburse ppp lenders for any amount of a ppp covered loan that is forgiven and ppp lenders will not be held liable for any representations made by ppp borrowers in connection with their requests for loan forgiveness lenders receive predetermined fees for processing and servicing ppp loans in addition ppp loans are riskweighted at zero percent under the generallyapplicable standardized approach used to calculate riskweighted assets for regulatory capital purposes hsbc bank usa is a ppp participating lender and had loans funded under the ppp which totaled million at june in july the paycheck protection program extension act was signed into law establishing august as the new deadline to apply for a ppp loan main street lending program in july the main street lending program mslp became fully operational the mslp was established by the frb under the cares act to support lending to small and mediumsized businesses that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the covid19 pandemic the mslp operates under various facilities depending on the hsbc usa inc size and other characteristics of the eligible businesses the federal reserve bank of boston has set up a special purpose vehicle which will purchase percent of each mslp loan that is submitted to the program provided that the required documentation is complete and the transactions are consistent with the relevant mslp facilitys requirements as such mslp lenders will retain only percent of an mslp loan we are evaluating whether we will participate in the mslp basis of reporting our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap group reporting basis we report financial information to hsbc in accordance with hsbc group accounting and reporting policies which apply international financial reporting standards ifrss as issued by the iasb and endorsed by the eu and as a result our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of hsbc groups accounting and reporting policies group reporting basis because operating results on the group reporting basis are used in managing our businesses and rewarding performance of employees our management also separately monitors profit before tax under this basis of reporting the following table reconciles our us gaap versus group reporting basis profit before tax three months ended june six months ended june in millions profit loss before tax us gaap basis adjustments expected credit losses goodwill impairment precious metal loans loan origination deposit incentives leases pension and other postretirement benefit costs other profit loss before tax group reporting basis the significant differences between us gaap and the group reporting basis as they impact our results are summarized in note business segments in our form 10k in addition see note business segments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant changes since december in the differences between us gaap and the group reporting basis impacting our results differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for the periods presented are explained below during the six months ended june expected credit losses were higher under us gaap than under the group reporting basis under the group reporting basis a majority of our commercial loans are considered to be in stage which requires a 12month expected credit losses estimate while under us gaap such loans require a lifetime expected credit losses estimate as a result of the different approaches the impact of the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of economic forecasts used to calculate expected credit losses and provisions for downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit was more pronounced under us gaap during the six months ended june goodwill impairment charges were lower under the group reporting basis than under us gaap under the group reporting basis goodwill was amortized until however goodwill was amortized under us gaap until which resulted in a lower carrying amount of goodwill and therefore a lower impairment charge under the group reporting basis during the three and six months ended june credit loss estimates were higher under us gaap than under the group reporting basis due primarily to the impact of downgrades in the commercial loan portfolio which was more pronounced under us gaap partially offset by a release in credit loss reserves under us gaap for risk factors associated with fraud in addition expected credit losses under the group reporting basis in the yeartodate period reflect a release in credit loss reserves due to hsbc usa inc the upgrade of a single oil and gas industry client which resulted in reclassification from stage which requires a lifetime expected credit losses estimate to stage which requires a 12month expected credit losses estimate critical accounting policies and estimates of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we have identified certain items as critical accounting estimates based on the associated degree of judgment and complexity see critical accounting policies and estimates in mda in our form 10k for further discussion determining the allowance for credit losses on loans has historically been identified as a critical accounting estimate on january we adopted new accounting guidance which requires entities to estimate and recognize an allowance for lifetime expected credit losses lifetime ecl for loans and other financial assets measured at amortized cost previously an allowance for credit losses on loans was recognized based on probable incurred losses see note allowance for credit losses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies and methodologies for establishing the allowance for credit losses and liability for offbalance sheet credit exposures the accounting estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses remains a critical accounting estimate for the following reasons changes in the provision for credit losses can materially affect our financial results estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses require us to project future borrower performance including cash flows delinquencies and chargeoffs along with when applicable collateral values based on a reasonable and supportable forecast period utilizing forwardlooking economic scenarios in order to estimate probability of default and loss given default and the allowance for credit losses is influenced by factors outside of our control such as industry and business trends geopolitical events and the effects of laws and regulations as well as economic conditions such as trends in housing prices interest rates gdp inflation energy prices and unemployment and judgment is required to determine whether the models used to generate the allowance for credit losses produce an estimate that is sufficient to encompass the current view of lifetime ecl because our estimates of the allowance for credit losses involve judgment and are influenced by factors outside our control there is uncertainty inherent in these estimates our estimate of lifetime ecl is inherently uncertain because it is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions and other factors outside of our control changes in such estimates could significantly impact our allowance and provision for credit losses as discussed further in note allowance for credit losses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements we use three forwardlooking economic scenarios to estimate lifetime ecl they represent a most likely outcome the central scenario and two less likely outer scenarios referred to as the upside scenario and the downside scenario during the second quarter of economic conditions remained weak and economic uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic continued to remain high given the high level of economic uncertainty in the current environment we developed and utilized a fourth scenario for estimating lifetime ecl at june referred to as the alternative downside scenario to reflect the possibility that the adverse impact associated with the deterioration in economic conditions could manifest itself over a far longer period of time each of the four scenarios were assigned weightings with the majority of the weighting placed on the central scenario the second most weighting placed on the downside scenario and lower equal weights placed on the upside and alternative downside scenarios this weighting was deemed appropriate for the estimation of lifetime ecl under current conditions as an illustration of the effect of changes in estimates relating to the allowance for credit losses using a percent weighting for the alternative downside scenario instead of using the four weighted scenarios as described above at june would have resulted in a combined increase to our allowance for credit losses and liability for offbalance sheet credit exposures of approximately million this illustration only represents the effect of changes in the weighting of these scenarios on our existing portfolios and does not consider changes in the allowance related to management judgment that might occur hsbc usa inc balance sheet review the following table provides balance sheet totals at june and increases

respectively see credit quality in this mda for a discussion of trends in our allowance for credit losses on loans commercial loans increased compared with december due to elevated demand driven by the deterioration in economic conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic as clients drew on their available lines of credit and we funded new loans largely associated with the paycheck protection program the increase in commercial nonaffiliate loans was primarily in the consumer services automobiles retailing capital goods and consumer durables and apparel industries partially offset by a decline in the diversified financials industry consumer loans increased modestly compared with december as higher residential mortgage loans were largely offset by paydowns in credit card receivables due to lower customer spending and changes in underwriting criteria driven by the current economic environment as well as a continued decline in home equity mortgages the increase in other consumer loans reflects higher personal loans driven by new product promotions the following table presents loantovalue ltv ratios for our residential mortgage loan portfolio excluding mortgage loans held for

appraised value at the time of loan origination updated by the change in the federal housing finance agencys house pricing index hpi at either a core based statistical area or state level the estimated value of the homes could differ from actual fair values due to changes in condition of the underlying property variations in housing hsbc usa inc price changes within metropolitan

breakout of trading securities by category trading securities balances decreased compared with december due primarily to decreases in equity and foreign sovereign positions trading security positions are held as economic hedges of interest rate credit and equity derivative products issued to clients of domestic and emerging markets balances of securities sold not yet purchased were lower compared with december driven by a decrease in short us treasury positions related to economic hedges of derivatives in the interest rate trading portfolio precious metals trading assets increased compared

to protect against changes in market pricing and an increase in positions held as economic hedges for client derivative activity as well as higher spot prices payables for precious metals were lower compared with december reflecting a decline in borrowing of gold inventory to support client activity levels precious metal positions may not represent our net underlying exposure as we may use derivatives contracts to reduce our risk associated with these positions the fair value of which would appear in derivatives in the table above derivative asset and liability balances both increased compared with december mainly from market movements partially offset by a reduction in positions driven by the exit of certain derivative contracts as part of our restructuring plan market movements resulted in higher valuations of interest rate foreign exchange and commodity derivatives partially offset by lower valuations of credit and equity derivatives securities securities include securities

the covid19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts we use for calculating lifetime ecl in and provisions for downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and risk factors associated with large loan exposures while a loss provision associated with loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit contributed to the loss provision in the yeartodate period a significant portion of commercial lines of credit that were drawn in march were repaid during the second quarter of resulting in a release of credit loss reserves partially offsetting the loss provision in the three months ended june in the prior year periods the loss provisions were driven by downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain

respectively the loss provisions in the current year periods were driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts we use for calculating lifetime ecl in and higher dollars of delinquency also contributing to the loss provisions in the current year periods was growth in personal loan balances due to new product promotions while loss provisions were recorded for credit cards in the current year periods the provision in the second quarter of was not as significant due to lower customer spending and changes in underwriting criteria driven by the current economic environment which resulted in a decline in credit card balances in the prior year periods the loss provisions were due primarily to provisions for credit losses on credit cards reflecting growth in balances due to increased customer activity and new product promotions including higher dollars of delinquency hsbc usa inc the provision for credit losses on offbalance sheet credit exposures reflects a release in credit loss reserves during the three months ended june as lower outstanding exposure and a lower estimate of expected future draws more than offset the impact of the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic consistent with commercial loans as discussed above in the yeartodate

offset by higher foreign exchange revenue as higher market volatility driven by the covid19 pandemic resulted in increased trading activity in both emerging markets and g10 currencies higher revenue

emerging markets rate products and interest rate swaps partially offset by million of trading losses recorded during the second quarter of associated with the exit of certain derivative contracts as part of our restructuring plan in addition while hedging activities resulted in higher revenue and contributed to the increase in the threemonth period they resulted in lower revenue and partially offset the increase in the yeartodate period foreign exchange and metals revenue increased during the three months ended june due primarily to higher metals revenue as valuation losses that were recorded in march due to market volatility caused by the covid19 pandemic largely recovered during the second quarter in the yeartodate period foreign exchange and metals revenue increased due to

is lending to various commercial institutional governmental and individual customers we participate in lending activity throughout the united states and on a limited basis internationally covid19 loan forbearance initiatives we have implemented various loan modification payment deferral programs to provide borrowers relief from the economic impacts of covid19 substantially all of the loans under these programs are not classified as tdr loans at june due to their shortterm nature as discussed under the interagency statement in addition under the interagency statement for covid19 related loan modifications in the form of a payment deferral the borrowers past due status will not be impacted during the deferral period and if the loan was accruing at the time the relief was granted the loan will generally not be placed on nonaccrual status as long as the payment deferral is for six months or less for consumer loans when a borrower requests and is provided with extended relief in the form of a payment deferral of more than six months the loan will generally be placed on nonaccrual status and assessed for tdr loan classification we have not modified our commercial loan nonaccrual

to a lesser extent higher loss estimates on our consumer loan portfolio our commercial allowance for credit losses at june increased million or percent as compared with march and increased million or percent as compared with january driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts we use for calculating lifetime ecl in and higher loss estimates for downgrades reflecting weakness in the financial condition of certain clients and risk factors associated with large loan exposures while higher loss estimates associated with loan growth as clients drew on their available lines of credit contributed to the increase as compared with january a significant portion of commercial lines of credit that were drawn in march were repaid during the second quarter of resulting in a release of credit loss reserves partially offsetting the increase as compared with march our consumer allowance for credit losses at june increased million or percent as compared with march and increased million or percent as compared with january driven by the deterioration of economic conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic which resulted in a worsening of the economic forecasts we use for calculating lifetime ecl in and higher dollars of delinquency also contributing to the increases was a higher allowance for credit losses on other consumer loans reflecting growth in personal loan balances due to new product promotion while a higher allowance for credit losses on credit cards contributed to the increase as compared with january lower customer spending and changes in underwriting criteria driven by the current economic environment resulted in a decline in credit card balances and a lower allowance for credit losses on credit cards as compared with march the liability for offbalance sheet credit exposures at june decreased million or percent as compared with march as a lower estimate of expected

concentration of credit risk a concentration of credit risk is defined as a significant credit exposure with an individual or group engaged in similar activities or affected similarly by economic

commercial institutional governmental and individual customers throughout the united states and internationally we manage the varying degrees of credit risk associated with on and offbalance sheet transactions through specific credit policies and procedures which provide for a strict approval monitoring and reporting process it is our policy to require collateral when it is deemed appropriate varying degrees and types of collateral are secured depending upon managements credit evaluation our consumer loan portfolio includes the following types of loans interestonly loans a loan which

position in the event the counterparties of such contracts fail to perform under the terms of those contracts in managing derivative credit risk both the current exposure which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered counterparties to our derivative activities include financial institutions central clearing parties foreign and domestic government agencies corporations funds mutual funds hedge funds etc insurance companies and private clients as well as other hsbc entities these counterparties are subject to regular credit review by the credit risk management department to minimize credit risk we may enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events in addition we reduce credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties the determination of the need for and the levels of collateral will differ based on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty andor regulatory requirements the total risk in a derivative contract is a function of a number of variables such as volatility of interest rates currencies equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments current market events or trends country risk maturity and liquidity of contracts creditworthiness of the counterparties in the transaction the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties and existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures the table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the general riskbased capital rules of the basel iii standardized approach which includes the net positive marktomarket of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount the regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and therefore allow for reductions of riskweighted assets when netting requirements have been met and collateral exists as a result riskweighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures furthermore many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral in addition many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date as a result these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital rules june december in millions risk associated with

standard over a fiveyear period hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa have elected the fiveyear transition option and as a result beginning in our capital ratios are reported in accordance with the transition rules in the interim final rule accordingly during and we will exclude from regulatory capital the change in retained earnings resulting from adoption of the new accounting standard on january as well as percent of the change in the allowance for credit losses recognized between january and december beginning january the excluded impacts will be phased in to regulatory capital over a threeyear transition period and will be fully reflected at january in addition in april the frb issued an interim final rule adopting a temporary change to the calculation of the slr that permits bank holding companies such as hsbc north america and hsbc usa to exclude us treasury securities and deposits at federal reserve banks from the denominator of their slr this change which took effect april will remain in place until march and is designed to allow banking institutions to expand their balance sheets to accommodate increased customer deposits while continuing to provide credit to companies and households in may the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that permits depository institutions such as hsbc bank usa to exclude us treasury securities and deposits at federal reserve banks from the denominator of their slr this change took effect june and will remain in place until march we manage capital in accordance with hsbc group policy the hsbc north america internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap works in conjunction with the hsbc groups icaap the hsbc north america icaap applies to hsbc bank usa and evaluates regulatory capital adequacy and capital adequacy under various stress scenarios our approach is to meet our capital needs for these stress scenarios locally through activities which reduce risk to the extent that local alternatives are insufficient as a whollyowned subsidiary of hsbc we would seek support from our ultimate parent regulatory capital requirements are based on the amount of capital required to be held plus applicable capital buffers as defined by regulations and the amount of riskweighted assets and leverage exposure also calculated based on regulatory definitions we are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by us banking regulators including basel iii the basel iii rule under the basel iii rule there are two methods available to calculate riskweighted assets the generallyapplicable standardized approach and the advanced approaches which are required in addition to the standardized approach for large banking organizations that meet certain thresholds in the frb and the other federal banking agencies jointly finalized rules to implement the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act relief act that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards for large bank holding companies bhcs and foreign banking organizations the tailoring rules the tailoring rules assign each bhc and ihc with billion or more in total us assets into one of five classifications categories i through hsbc usa inc iv and other firms based on its size and four riskbased indicators under the tailoring rules hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa are subject to category iii standards beginning january and are no longer considered advanced approaches banking organizations however hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa remain subject to certain other capital requirements that were previously applicable only to advanced approaches banking organizations including the slr and the countercyclical capital buffer prior to adoption of the tailoring rules hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa had requested and received regulatory approval to opt out of the advanced approaches and therefore have previously calculated and will continue to calculate their riskbased capital requirements for credit risk solely under the standardized approach the tailoring rules also permit category iii firms and their depository institution subsidiaries to optout of the requirement to recognize most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci in regulatory capital as a result hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa made a onetime election to optout of the requirement to include all components of aoci with the exception of accumulated net gains and losses on cash flow hedges related to items that are not carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet in common equity tier capital effective beginning with march reporting category iii firms and their depository institution subsidiaries will also benefit from i simpler capital requirements for mortgage servicing assets certain deferred tax assets and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions and ii a simplified treatment for the amount of capital issued by consolidated subsidiaries to third parties generally known as minority interests which can be included in regulatory capital these simplifying amendments were adopted in a separate rulemaking finalized by the federal banking agencies in and became effective beginning april although firms may choose to apply the simplifications as early as january as such hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa implemented both the tailoring rules and the simplifying amendments beginning with march reporting in the federal banking agencies also jointly amended the basel iii rule to implement a provision of the relief act by reducing the risk weighting applicable to highvolatility commercial real estate exposures and also finalized a rule to include a revised standardized approach for measuring counterparty credit risk saccr to calculate total riskweighted asset amounts for derivative transactions in addition to the existing current exposure method cem these changes also became effective beginning april the tailoring rules clarify that category iii firms and their depository institution subsidiaries are not required to use saccr to measure their derivative exposure instead they have the option to use either saccr or cem for their riskbased capital ratios and the slr as such hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa have elected not to use saccr at this time but will continue to

the frb requires ihcs and bhcs including hsbc north america to comply with the frbs capital plan rule and ccar program as well as the annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the frb and annual companyrun stress tests as required under doddfrank collectively dfast as amended by the relief act under the tailoring rules hsbc north america as a category iii firm is no longer subject to a midcycle stress testing requirement beginning january and is now required to disclose its companyrun stress test results only every other year the companyrun stress tests are forward looking exercises to assess the impact of hypothetical macroeconomic baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the frb and internally developed scenarios for the companyrun exercises on the financial condition and capital adequacy of a bankholding company over a nine quarter planning horizon in march the frb adopted a final rule on the stress capital buffer scb which will among other things replace the current fixed percent capital conservation buffer with a dynamic institutionspecific riskbased scb it is expected that the scb will vary in size throughout the economic cycle depending on a firms risk exposures and the severity of its stress scenarios under the final rule the scb would be recalibrated annually based on the sum of i a firms projected losses under the severely adverse scenario in supervisory stress tests and ii four quarters of a firms planned future dividends if hsbc north americas riskbased capital ratios were to fall to levels within the scb it would become subject to increasing restrictions on their capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments the final rule also eliminates the quantitative objection component of ccar and instead relies on the capital rules automatic restrictions on capital distributions that are triggered if a firm breaches its buffer requirements the scb will be officially set for each ccar firm by august based on supervisory stress testing results conducted as part of ccar and will become effective october hsbc north america already utilizes an internal capital assessment approach that is analogous to the scb and will continue to review the composition of its capital structures and capital buffers in light of the final rule the scb applies only to hsbc north america hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa remain

in the accompanying consolidated financial statements other regulatory developments frb liquidity facilities the frb announced the creation of several facilities aimed at stabilizing the markets addressing immediate liquidity concerns and facilitating lending and other assistance to businesses and individuals affected by shutdowns due to covid19 these programs include among others the money market mutual fund liquidity facility the term assetbacked securities loan facility the commercial paper funding facility the primary market corporate credit facility and the paycheck protection

private equity or hedge funds or engage in certain types of proprietary trading see part i regulation and competition the volcker rule in our form 10k in june the five regulatory agencies responsible for implementing the volcker rule approved a final rule that makes significant revisions to the covered funds provisions of the current implementing regulations these revisions include i new exclusions for credit funds venture capital funds family wealth management vehicles and client facilitation vehicles and an expanded scope for the public welfare fund exclusion and ii revisions to address practical obstacles to reliance on the existing exclusions for loan securitizations foreign public funds and small business investment companies these amendments to the volcker rule will become effective october we continue to assess the impact of the amendments on our operations uncleared swap margin also in june the us banking regulators approved a final rule that makes significant amendments to their margin requirements for noncleared swaps and securitybased swaps together swaps for swap dealers securitybased swap dealers major swap participants and major securitybased swap participants regulated by the agencies swap entities the margin rules the final rule mostly exempts swap entities from needing to collect initial margin im for swaps with affiliates preserves legacy status for swaps that are amended to replace certain interest rate provisions or due to technical amendments notional reductions or portfolio compression exercises clarifies the time at which im

estimated full year in billions increase decrease in funding needs net change in loans net change in shortterm investments and securities net change in trading and other assets total funding needs increase decrease in funding sources net change in deposits net change in trading and other shortterm liabilities net change in longterm debt total funding sources reductions to trading assets estimated during the july through december period are mainly related to select fixed income activities which will be consolidated in and operated from europe to better utilize hsbcs global scale which allows us to record revenue as a business introducer and hold fewer assets on our balance sheet in addition we will also exit certain derivative contracts as part of our restructuring plan as previously discussed the timing of our strategic actions may be resequenced or delayed in light of covid19 we continue to reassess our strategic plan and may take additional actions in future periods the above table reflects a longterm funding strategy daily balances fluctuate as we accommodate customer needs while ensuring that we have liquidity in place to support the balance sheet maturity funding profile should market conditions deteriorate we have contingency plans to generate additional liquidity through the sales of assets or financing transactions we remain confident in our ability to access the market for longterm debt funding needs in the current market environment we continue to seek wellpriced and stable customer deposits we also continue to sell new agencyeligible mortgage loan originations to third parties hsbc bank usa is subject to significant restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to and certain other covered transactions with hsbc usa and other affiliates for further discussion see part i regulation and competition affiliate transaction restrictions in our form 10k see risk management in this mda for further discussion relating to our liquidity contingency plans and our approach to liquidity and funding risk management hsbc usa inc offbalance sheet arrangements credit derivatives and other contractual obligations as part of our normal operations we enter into credit derivatives and various offbalance sheet arrangements with affiliates and third parties these arrangements arise principally in connection with our lending and client intermediation activities and involve primarily extensions of credit and in certain cases guarantees as a financial services provider we routinely extend credit through loan commitments and lines and letters of credit and provide financial guarantees including derivative transactions having characteristics of a guarantee the contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee the following table provides maturity information related to our credit derivatives and offbalance sheet arrangements many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default in addition implementation of our business strategy as described under the heading executive overview business update in our form 10k will affect our contractual obligations over time including with respect to credit derivatives as a result we believe that the contractual amount is not representative of the actual future credit exposure or funding requirements balance at june one year or less over one through five years over five years total balance at december in millions standby letters of credit net of participations commercial letters of credit credit derivatives other commitments to extend credit commercial consumer total includes million and million issued for the benefit of hsbc affiliates at june and december respectively includes million and million issued for the benefit of hsbc affiliates at june and december respectively includes million and million issued for the benefit of hsbc affiliates at june and december respectively other commitments to extend credit other commitments to extend credit include arrangements whereby we are contractually obligated to extend credit in the form of loans participations in loans lease financing receivables or similar transactions consumer commitments are comprised of certain unused mastercardvisa credit card lines where we have the right to change terms or conditions upon notification to the customer and commitments to extend credit secured by residential properties where we have the right to change terms or conditions for cause upon notification to the customer commercial commitments comprise primarily those related to secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit in addition to the above we have established and manage a number of constant net asset value cnav money market funds that invest in shorterdated highlyrated money market securities to provide investors with a highly liquid and secure investment these funds price the assets in their portfolio on an amortized cost basis which enables them to create and liquidate shares at a constant price the funds however are not permitted to price their portfolios at amortized cost if that amount varies by more than basis points from the portfolios market value in that case the fund would be required to price its portfolio at market value and consequently would no longer be able to create or liquidate shares at a constant price we do not consolidate the cnav funds because we do not absorb the majority of the expected future risk associated with the funds assets including interest rate liquidity credit and other relevant risks that are expected to affect the value of the assets hsbc usa inc fair value fair value hierarchy fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability the fair value framework the fair value framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants assumptions it emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs for financial instruments carried at fair value the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market level where the market for a financial instrument is not active valuation techniques are used the majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument level because level and level instruments are determined by observable inputs less judgment is applied in determining their fair values in the absence of observable market inputs the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs level the determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve we consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price the level of bidask spreads a lack of pricing transparency due to among other things complexity of the product and market liquidity whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data and whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities a financial instrument is classified as a level measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the overthecounter otc market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume we regard financial instruments such as debt securities equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded nonexchangetraded instruments classified as level assets include securities issued by the us treasury tobeannounced securities noncallable securities issued by us government sponsored enterprises and certain foreign governmentbacked debt level inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as level inputs we classify mortgage passthrough securities agency and certain nonagency mortgage collateralized obligations nonexchangetraded derivative contracts assetbacked securities obligations of us states and political subdivisions corporate debt securities certain foreign governmentbacked debt preferred securities securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements precious metals certain loans held for sale residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral real estate owned and beginning january certain student loans held for investment as level measurements where possible at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments we have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the third party pricing services to ensure that pricing information meets the fair value objective and where appropriate this pricing data is backtested to market trade executions where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value we investigate and reconcile the differences if the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value the instrument will be classified as level within the fair value hierarchy in general we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a nonderivative instrument level derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity the fair value of certain derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable indices traded in the otc market appropriate control processes and procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors level inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability that is level inputs incorporate market participants assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk we develop level inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances at june and december our level measurements included the following certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded credit foreign exchange or equity derivatives that have significant unobservable inputs eg volatility or default correlations assetbacked credit default swaps with certain inputs which are unobservable certain corporate debt securities certain assetbacked securities individually assessed commercial loans derivatives hsbc usa inc referenced to illiquid assets of less desirable credit quality and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of visa class b shares for which the fair value is dependent upon the final resolution of the related litigation see note fair value measurements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on level inputs level measurements the following table provides information about level assetsliabilities in relation to total assetsliabilities measured at fair value at june and december june december  are in millions level assets total assets measured at fair value level liabilities total liabilities measured at fair value level assets as a percent of total assets measured at fair value level liabilities as a percent of total liabilities measured at fair value presented without netting which allows the offsetting of amounts relating to certain contracts if certain conditions are met includes million of recurring level assets and million of nonrecurring level assets at june includes million of recurring level assets and million of nonrecurring level assets at december includes million of assets measured on a recurring basis and million of assets measured on a nonrecurring basis at june includes million of assets measured on a recurring basis and million of assets measured on a nonrecurring basis at december significant changes in fair value for level assets and liabilities see note fair value measurements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into out of level measurements during the three and six months ended june and as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value effect of changes in significant unobservable inputs the fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by derived from or corroborated by observable market data the resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value measurements of these financial instruments for the purpose of preparing the financial statements the final valuation inputs selected are based on managements best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities the unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures when we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately million or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement of approximately million at june the effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of credit derivatives executed against certain insurers and certain dealcontingent forward starting interest rate derivatives risk management overview managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities we use a comprehensive risk management framework across the organization and across all risk types underpinned by our risk culture this framework fosters continuous monitoring promotes risk awareness and encourages sound operational and strategic decisionmaking it also ensures a consistent approach to identifying assessing managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities our board of directors has the ultimate responsibility for effective management of risk it is advised on risk matters by the risk committee of the board of directors and the compliance and conduct committee in particular the risk committee of the board of directors advises the board of directors on risk appetite and its alignment with our strategy risk governance and internal controls as well as highlevel risk related matters robust risk governance and accountability are embedded throughout our business through an established framework that helps to ensure appropriate oversight of and accountability for the effective management of risk our material risks the principal risks associated with our operations include the following credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract hsbc usa inc capital and liquidity risk is the risk of having insufficient capital liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements including pension risk market risk is the risk that movements in market factors such as foreign exchange rates interest rates credit spreads equity prices and commodity prices will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios resilience risk is the risk that we are unable to provide critical services to our customers affiliates and counterparties as a result of sustained and significant operational disruption regulatory compliance risk is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of relevant laws codes rules regulations and standards of good market practice which as a consequence incur fines and penalties and suffer damage to our business financial crime and fraud risk is the risk that we knowingly or unknowingly help parties to commit or to further potentially illegal activity including both internal and external fraud strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify execute and react appropriately to opportunities andor threats arising from changes in the market some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances customer requirements demographic trends regulatory developments or competitor action model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from business decisions informed by models which can be exacerbated by errors in methodology design or the way they are used in the course of our regular risk management activities we use models to help quantify the risk we are taking we believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable within the parameters for which the models have been built and calibrated to operate but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models consequently actual results may differ significantly from model projections the severe projections of macroeconomic variables during the current covid19 pandemic represent events outside the parameters for which the models have been built as a result adjustments to model outputs to reflect consideration of management judgment are used with stringent governance in place to ensure appropriate results where models do not require adjustments enhanced model monitoring confirms models are performing as intended see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of the objectives of our risk management system as well as our risk management policies and practices there have been no material changes to our approach to risk management since december however during the first half of we continued to enhance our risk management by further simplifying our approach and articulation of risk management through combining our enterprise risk management framework and our operational risk management framework to create a single simplified risk management framework credit risk management credit risk is managed through a robust risk identification and control framework which outlines clear and consistent policies principles and guidance for risk managers credit risk is monitored using various internal risk management measures and within limits approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities our credit risk management procedures are designed for all stages of economic and financial cycles including challenging periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty as a result of market volatility and economic uncertainty driven by the covid19 pandemic we rereviewed the credit ratings assigned to substantially all of our material commercial loans during the first half of see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of our approach to credit risk asu process on january we adopted the requirements of asu financial instruments credit losses asu the implementation of asu represents a significant challenge to our risk and finance functions the asu introduces new concepts and measures such as lifetime ecl some of these new concepts and measures differ significantly from the ifrs financial instruments ifrs credit loss reporting that we implemented in for segment reporting under the group reporting basis as a result of asu adoption management has additional insight and measures not previously utilized which over time may influence our risk appetite and risk management processes the asu process comprises three main areas modeling the risk function had preexisting models developed in conjunction with our ifrs reporting to hsbc these models were enhanced or supplemented to address the requirements of asu such as incorporating forward economic guidance for a reasonable and supportable forecast period reversion to historical losses the expectation for zero losses under certain conditions and lifetime ecl for undrawn credit exposures with the appropriate governance and independent review the models vary in complexity and inputs depending upon the size of the portfolio the amount of data available and the sophistication of the market concerned implementation a centralized impairment engine has been implemented to perform the lifetime ecl calculation the impairment engine receives data which is subject to a number of validation checks and enhancements from a variety of client finance and risk systems once the lifetime ecl calculation has been calculated there are further data analysis checks and review and challenge of the results prior to commencing formal governance risk and finance work closely together throughout the execution of this process governance a management review committee has been established in order to review and approve the results of the lifetime ecl calculation the management review committee has representatives from credit risk and finance and is responsible for final approval of our lifetime ecl for the period the chief credit officer and the wpb chief risk officer hsbc usa inc share responsibility with the chief financial officer for establishing appropriate levels of allowances for credit losses inherent in various loan and other portfolios carried at amortized cost capital and liquidity risk management although our overall approach to capital and liquidity risk management has not changed we continuously monitor our capital ratios and the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our frameworks as necessary to reflect market events and the evolving regulatory landscape and view as to best practices see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of our approach to capital and liquidity risk capital risk see liquidity and capital resources in this mda for a discussion of our approach to capital risk including our capital ratios and regulatory capital requirements liquidity and funding risk as part of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management we employ the measures discussed below to define monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with hsbc policy the basel committee based liquidity coverage ratio lcr is designed to be a shortterm liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets hqla to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next days at both june and december hsbc usas lcr under the european lcr rule exceeded percent a lcr of percent or higher reflects an unencumbered hqla balance that is equal to or exceeds liquidity needs for a calendar day liquidity stress scenario hqla consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa are also subject to the us lcr rule and are required to report lcr to us regulators on a daily basis the tailoring rules reduced the us lcr requirement for category iii firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding under billion and their depository institution subsidiaries including hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa from to percent beginning january as a result under the us lcr rule a lcr of percent or higher reflects an unencumbered hqla balance that is equal to or exceeds percent of liquidity needs for a calendar day liquidity stress scenario during the six months ended june hsbc bank usas lcr under the us lcr rule remained above the percent minimum requirement the european calibration of the basel committee based net stable funding ratio nsfr which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities is still pending therefore our calculation of nsfr is based on our current interpretation and understanding of the basel committee nsfr guidance which may differ in future periods depending on completion of the european calibration and further implementation guidance from regulators the basel nsfr guidance has been interpreted in certain instances to include expected changes from the capital requirements directive and regulation commonly referred to as crr2 our calculation of nsfr will fully follow the crr2 reporting rules when they are expected to become effective in june at both june and december hsbc usas estimated nsfr exceeded percent a nsfr of percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of funding for assets and offbalance sheet exposures in april us regulators issued for public comment a proposal to implement the nsfr in the united states applicable to certain large banking organizations including hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa the tailoring rules also indicate that an percent nsfr requirement will apply to category iii firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding under billion and their depository institution subsidiaries including hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa once the nsfr is finalized as a result under the proposed us nsfr rule a nsfr of percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next months that is equal to or exceeds percent of the required amount of funding for assets and offbalance sheet exposures at both june and december hsbc bank usas estimated nsfr based on our current interpretation and understanding of the proposed us nsfr rule exceeded percent as a category iii firm hsbc north america remains subject to liquidity stress testing on a monthly basis and related liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa have adjusted their liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa may need to make further changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future rules our liquidity and funding risk management approach includes deposits supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans in addition regulations require banks to retain a portfolio of hqla as such we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities hsbc usa inc our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong ratings from the major credit ratings agencies the following table

matters all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions in april fitch changed the rating outlook for both hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa to negative from stable following a similar change in outlook to negative from stable for hsbc the outlook change reflects the economic disruption driven by the covid19 pandemic while the outlook changed fitch affirmed the longterm credit rating for hsbc usa concurrently fitch upgraded the longterm credit rating for hsbc bank usa by one notch to aa following a review of hsbcs resolution plan in may sp downgraded the long and shortterm issuer credit ratings of hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa by one notch following a similar rating action for hsbc the long and shortterm issuer credit ratings of hsbc usa were downgraded to a and a2 respectively from a and a1 respectively while the long and shortterm issuer credit ratings of hsbc bank usa were downgraded to a and a1 respectively from aa and a1 respectively these rating downgrades reflect sps view that the hsbc group will not be fully shielded from the global economic downturn resulting from the measures taken against the spread of covid19 and that weaker earnings arising from higher credit charges will be exacerbated by low interest rates in conjunction with these downgrades sp revised their rating outlooks for hsbc hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa to stable from negative while these rating actions by fitch and sp did not have a material financial impact on our borrowing costs or liquidity any future actions could have such an impact although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future at june there were no pending actions in terms of changes to ratings on the debt of hsbc usa or hsbc bank usa from any of the rating agencies see liquidity and capital resources in this mda for further discussion of our liquidity position including information regarding our outstanding borrowings the remaining availability of our debt issuance programs and our funding strategy market risk management exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios trading portfolios comprise positions arising from marketmaking and warehousing of clientderived positions nontrading portfolios comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities and financial investments classified as availableforsale and heldtomaturity we apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and nontrading portfolios our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimize return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of our approach to market risk value at risk var var is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence the use of var is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalize them in addition we calculate var for nontrading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk var measures are calculated to a percent confidence level and use a oneday holding period trading portfolios trading var generates from the global markets unit of the gbm business segment portfolios are mainly comprised of foreign exchange products interest rate swaps credit default swaps and precious metals ie gold silver platinum in both north america and emerging markets hsbc usa inc the following graph summarizes daily var for our trading portfolios at a percent confidence level in millions the following table summarizes our trading var for the six months ended june foreign exchange and commodity interest rate credit spread portfolio diversification total in millions at june six months ended june average maximum minimum at december portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types it represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types for example foreign exchange interest rate and credit spread together in one portfolio it is measured as the difference between the sum of the var by individual risk type and the combined total var a negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification as the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures the total var is nonadditive across risk types due to diversification effects for presentation purposes portfolio diversification of the var for trading portfolios includes varbased risknotinvar backtesting we routinely validate the accuracy of our var models by backtesting them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes nonmodeled items such as fees commissions and revenues of intraday transactions from the actual reported profit and loss we would expect under stable market conditions to see two or three losses in excess of var at the percent confidence level over a oneyear period however in periods of unstable market conditions we could see an increase in the number of backtesting exceptions during the six months ended june we experienced eight loss backtesting exceptions one loss exception in january was mainly driven by palladium volatility five loss exceptions in march and two loss exceptions in april were primarily due to intensified market volatility as a consequence of the covid19 pandemic despite the high number of loss exceptions performance of the var model was in line with expectations when considered in the context of the extraordinary market movements observed in march during the period market risk continued to be managed using a complementary set of exposure measures and limits including stress and scenario analysis nontrading portfolios nontrading var predominantly relates to bsm and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value which includes availableforsale and heldtomaturity assets and associated hedges our investment portfolio holdings are mainly comprised of us treasury us government agency mortgagebacked and us government sponsored mortgagebacked securities our nontrading var exposure is driven by interest rates and agency spread volatility hsbc usa inc the following table summarizes our nontrading var for the six months ended june interest rate credit spread portfolio diversification total in millions at june six months ended june average maximum minimum at december refer to the trading var table above for additional information the increase in nontrading var at june was due primarily to an increase in volatility of interest rates and us government agency credit spreads driven by the covid19 pandemic nontrading var also includes the interest rate risk of nontrading financial assets and liabilities held by the global businesses and transfer priced into bsm which has the mandate to centrally manage and hedge it see below for a broader discussion on how interest rate risk is

could be provided to our equity holder under a managed runoff scenario an eve sensitivity represents the change in eve due to a defined movement in interest rates we manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of basis points to the market implied interest rates at both june and december our eve remained within risk appetite for the up and down basis point interest rate shock scenarios net interest income simulation modeling techniques we utilize simulation modeling to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income these techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various scenarios such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by basis points as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by basis points over a twelve month period in the gradual scenarios percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter the following table reflects the impact on our projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques june december amount amount dollars are in millions estimated increase decrease in projected net interest income reflects projected rate movements on july and january respectively resulting from a gradual basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from a gradual basis point decrease in the yield curve other significant scenarios monitored reflects projected rate movements on july and january respectively resulting from an immediate basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from an immediate basis point decrease in the yield curve changes in the sensitivities since december have been primarily driven by the addition of payfixed positions and the acceleration of expected mortgage prepayments as a result of the significant drop in interest rates in addition the sensitivities in the downshock scenarios at june reflect no floors to the shocked market rates this is a change from the methodology published in our form 10k where previously market rates would have been floored to zero when applicable however customer product specific rate floors continue to be recognized where appropriate the projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality size and composition of the balance sheet therefore although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity actual results will differ from these estimates possibly by significant amounts hsbc usa inc consolidated average balances and interest rates the following table summarizes the quartertodate and yeartodate average daily balances of the
