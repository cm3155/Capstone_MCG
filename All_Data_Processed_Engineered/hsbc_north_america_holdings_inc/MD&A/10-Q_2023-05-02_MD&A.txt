raised concerns about potential weakness in the banking sector which could lead to tighter credit conditions for households and businesses further weighing on economic activity us gross domestic product gdp is currently forecast to have grown at an annual rate of percent in the first quarter of while the personal consumption expenditures price index of percent in march remained well above the frbs target inflation rate in march the frb increased shortterm interest rates by basis points the second such rate increase this quarter and indicated that some additional increases in shortterm interest rates may be needed in in order to fight inflation the impacts of high inflation rising interest rates and slowing economic growth in addition to recent banking sector concerns have created significant uncertainty about the future economic environment which will continue to impact our business in future periods concerns over domestic and global policy issues trade policy in the us and geopolitical events as well as the implications of those events on the markets in general further add to the global uncertainty there is also a risk that interest rate increases to fight inflation

restructuring plan including the nonrecurrence of million of costs related to the delivery of our restructuring plan costs to achieve recorded during the first quarter of as discussed further below this increase was partially offset by lower other revenues driven by the nonrecurrence of a gain of million recorded during the first quarter of on the sale of the branch disposal group associated

united kingdom uk financial conduct authority announced that the onemonth threemonth and sixmonth us dollar usd libor tenors will continue to be published until september using an amended methodology ie on an unrepresentative synthetic basis while the less commonly used overnight and twelvemonth usd libor tenors will cease to be provided immediately after june as previously planned the extension of certain usd libor tenors on a synthetic basis until september further aids in reducing the risks associated with transitioning legacy contracts onto replacement rates these synthetic tenors will be available only for use in certain legacy contracts and are not for use in new business we continue to actively participate in hsbcs global transition program with the objective of facilitating an orderly transition of all products processes models and curves as well as all legacy liborbased contracts onto replacement rates the focus of our client transition efforts is on those remaining usdlibor based contracts that mature after june such contracts outstanding at march consisted primarily of contracts for usd liborbased loans with a carrying value of approximately billion usd liborbased longterm debt with a carrying value of approximately billion billion of which is already set to transition to sofr as of july and usd liborbased derivatives with a notional value of approximately billion the substantial majority of our outstanding usd liborbased derivative contracts adhere to and are covered by the international swaps and derivatives association fallback protocol and are set to automatically transition at the first reset subsequent to june for usd liborbased loans approximately billion represents legacy contracts in our consumer mortgage loan portfolio which are set to transition to a sofrbased rate at the first applicable hsbc usa inc reset subsequent to june the remainder of our usd liborbased loans are legacy contracts in our commercial loan portfolio of approximately billion which will require further outreach with our clients in order to transition the ability of husi and its clients to transition legacy contracts onto replacement rates is dependent on the availability of products that reference replacement rates including sofr and on our customers being ready and able to adapt their own processes and systems to accommodate the replacement products market and industry use of sofr has increased and we remain committed to completing the transition of substantially all outstanding contracts during the first half of we continue to engage with industry participants the official sector and our clients to support an orderly transition and the mitigation of the risks resulting from the transition basis of reporting our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap group reporting basis we report financial information to hsbc in accordance with hsbc group accounting and reporting policies which apply international financial reporting standards ifrss as issued by the iasb as a result our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of hsbc groups accounting and reporting policies group reporting basis because operating results on the group reporting basis are used in managing our businesses and rewarding performance of employees our management also separately monitors profit before tax under this basis of reporting the following table reconciles our us gaap versus group reporting basis profit before tax three months ended march in millions profit before tax us gaap basis adjustments other longlived assets renewable energy tax credit investments loans held for sale expected credit losses other profit before tax group reporting basis the significant differences between us gaap and the group reporting basis as they impact our results are summarized in note business segments in our form 10k there have been no significant changes since december in the differences between us gaap and the group reporting basis impacting our results differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for the periods presented are explained below during the first quarter of other longlived assets in the table above reflects million of lease related impairment charges under us gaap associated with the exit of certain office space while under the group reporting basis impairment was recognized when we committed to vacate the space in the fourth quarter of in addition amortization expense for longlived assets in both periods was higher under us gaap due to the impact of impairment charges recorded under the group reporting basis in prior years in we recorded an impairment charge under the group reporting basis related to the writeoff of all the capitalized software and a portion of the leasehold improvements associated with our wealth and personal banking business segment while under us gaap no impairment charge was required subsequent to the impairment charge in we recorded additional impairment charges under the group reporting basis for newly completed leasehold improvements in our wealth and personal banking business segment while under us gaap they are capitalized and amortized consequently the carrying amounts of capitalized software and leasehold improvements are higher under us gaap than under the group reporting basis and as a result corresponding amortization expense is higher under us gaap during the first quarter of expected credit losses were lower under us gaap than under the group reporting basis under the group reporting basis a majority of our loans are considered to be in stage which requires a 12month expected credit losses estimate while under us gaap such loans require a lifetime expected credit losses ecl estimate primarily as a result of the different requirements the favorable impact of improved housing price forecasts on residential mortgages was more pronounced under us gaap during the first quarter of expected credit losses were higher under us gaap than under the group reporting basis primarily as a result of the different requirements related to stage loans discussed above the impact of higher loss estimates associated with loan growth and maturity extensions was more pronounced under us gaap hsbc usa inc balance sheet review the following table provides balance sheet totals at march and increases decreases since december increase decrease from

and our strategy for deploying liquidity shortterm investments increased compared with december due to an increase in overall liquidity as we raised funds in advance of their usage the increase in funds was driven by lower trading security positions new issuances of longterm debt and higher shortterm borrowings as discussed in detail below these increases were partially offset by net purchases

for credit losses on loans commercial loans were relatively flat compared with december as paydowns maturities and lower loans to affiliates were largely offset by new business activity in business

in the federal housing finance agencys house price index hpi at either a core based statistical area or state level the estimated value of the homes could differ from actual fair values due to changes in condition of the underlying property variations in housing price changes within metropolitan statistical areas and other factors as a result actual property values associated with loans that end in foreclosure may be significantly lower than the estimates used for purposes of this disclosure current estimated property values are calculated using the most current hpis available and applied on an individual loan basis which results in an approximate three month delay in the production of reportable statistics therefore the information in the table above reflects current estimated property

replacement cost of derivative contracts in a receivable position in the event the counterparties of such contracts fail to perform under the terms of those contracts in managing derivative credit risk both the current exposure which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered counterparties to our derivative activities include financial institutions central clearing parties foreign and domestic government agencies corporations funds mutual funds hedge funds etc insurance companies and private clients as well as other hsbc entities these counterparties are subject to regular credit review by the credit risk management department to minimize credit risk we may enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events in addition we reduce credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties the determination of the need for and the levels of collateral will differ based on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty andor regulatory requirements the total risk in a derivative contract is a function of a number of variables such as volatility of interest rates currencies equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments current market events or trends country risk maturity and liquidity of contracts creditworthiness of the counterparties in the transaction the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties and existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures the table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the general riskbased capital rules of the basel iii standardized approach which includes the net positive marktomarket of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount the regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and therefore allow for reductions of riskweighted assets when netting requirements have been met and collateral exists as a result riskweighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures furthermore many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral in addition many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date as a result these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital

derivative transactions as well as the contractual amounts outstanding at march and december see note guarantee arrangements pledged asset and repurchase agreements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default as a result we believe that the contractual amount is not representative of the actual future credit exposure or funding requirements our offbalance sheet arrangements also include transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities vies see note variable interest entities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of these unconsolidated vies hsbc usa inc fair value fair value hierarchy fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability the fair value framework the fair value framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants assumptions it emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs for financial instruments carried at fair value the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market level where the market for a financial instrument is not active valuation techniques are used the majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument level because level and level instruments are determined by observable inputs less judgment is applied in determining their fair values in the absence of observable market inputs the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs level the determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve we consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price the level of bidask spreads a lack of pricing transparency due to among other things complexity of the product and market liquidity whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data and whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities a financial instrument is classified as a level measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the overthecounter otc market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume we regard financial instruments such as debt securities equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded nonexchangetraded instruments classified as level assets include securities issued by the us treasury tobeannounced securities noncallable securities issued by us government sponsored enterprises and certain foreign governmentbacked debt level inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as level inputs we classify mortgage passthrough securities agency and certain nonagency mortgage collateralized obligations nonexchangetraded derivative contracts assetbacked securities obligations of us states and political subdivisions corporate debt securities certain foreign governmentbacked debt preferred securities securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements precious metals certain loans held for sale certain student loans residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral real estate owned and at december a client share repurchase transaction as level measurements where possible at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments we have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the third party pricing services to ensure that pricing information meets the fair value objective and where appropriate this pricing data is backtested to market trade executions where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value we investigate and reconcile the differences if the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value the instrument will be classified as level within the fair value hierarchy in general we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a nonderivative instrument level derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity the fair value of certain derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable indices traded in the otc market appropriate control processes and procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors level inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability that is level inputs incorporate market participants assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk we develop level inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances at march and december our level measurements included the following certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded derivatives have significant unobservable inputs eg hsbc usa inc volatility or default correlations certain assetbacked securities individually assessed commercial loans mortgage servicing rights derivatives with certain inputs which are unobservable certain credit default swaps certain loans held for sale and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of visa class b shares for which the fair value is dependent upon the final resolution of the related litigation see note fair value measurements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on level inputs level measurements the following table provides information about level assetsliabilities in relation to total assetsliabilities measured at fair value at march and december march december  are in millions level assets total assets measured at fair value level liabilities total liabilities measured at fair value level assets as a percent of total assets measured at fair value level liabilities as a percent of total liabilities measured at fair value presented without netting which allows the offsetting of amounts relating to certain contracts if certain conditions are met includes million of recurring level assets and million of nonrecurring level assets at march includes million of recurring level assets and million of nonrecurring level assets at december includes million of assets measured on a recurring basis and million of assets measured on a nonrecurring basis at march includes million of assets measured on a recurring basis and million of assets measured on a nonrecurring basis at december significant changes in fair value for level assets and liabilities see note fair value measurements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into out of level measurements during the three months ended march and as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value effect of changes in significant unobservable inputs the fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by derived from or corroborated by observable market data the resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value measurements of these financial instruments for the purpose of preparing the financial statements the final valuation inputs selected are based on managements best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities the unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures when we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately million or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement of approximately million at march the effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of certain creditlinked structured notes and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of visa class b shares risk management overview the primary role of risk management is to protect our customers business colleagues and the communities that we serve while ensuring we are able to support our strategy and provide sustainable growth we aim to use a comprehensive risk management approach across the organization and across all risk types underpinned by our culture and values this is outlined in our risk management framework including the key principles and practices that we employ in managing material risks both financial and nonfinancial this framework fosters continuous monitoring promotes risk awareness and encourages sound operational and strategic decisionmaking and escalation processes it also supports a consistent approach to identifying assessing managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities with clear accountabilities our board of directors has the ultimate responsibility for the effective oversight of risk management and approves our risk appetite it is advised on risk matters by the risk committee of the board of directors notably risk appetite and its alignment with our strategy risk governance and internal controls as well as highlevel risk related matters we use a defined executive hsbc usa inc risk governance structure to help ensure there is appropriate oversight and accountability embedded throughout our business for the effective management of risk our material risks the principal risks associated with our operations include the following credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract treasury risk is the risk of having insufficient capital liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements including the risk of an adverse impact on earnings due to changes in market interest rates together with pension risk market risk is the risk of an adverse financial impact on trading activities arising from changes in market parameters such as interest rates foreign exchange rates asset prices volatilities correlations and credit spreads climate risk relates to the financial and nonfinancial impacts that may arise as a result of climate change and the move to a greener economy resilience risk is the risk that we are unable to provide critical services to our customers affiliates and counterparties as a result of sustained and significant operational disruption regulatory compliance risk is the risk associated with breaching our duty to clients and other counterparties inappropriate market conduct and breaching related financial services regulatory standards financial crime risk is the risk of knowingly or unknowingly helping parties to commit or to further potentially illegal activity including money laundering fraud bribery and corruption tax evasion sanctions breaches and terrorist and proliferation financing strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify execute and react appropriately to opportunities andor threats arising from changes in the market some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances customer requirements demographic trends regulatory developments or competitor action and model risk is the risk of inappropriate or incorrect business decisions arising from the use of models that have been inadequately designed implemented or used or from models that do not perform in line with expectations and predictions in the course of our regular risk management activities we use models to help quantify the risk we are taking we believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable within the parameters for which the models have been built and calibrated to operate but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models adjustments to model outputs to reflect consideration of management judgment are used with stringent governance in place to ensure appropriate results where models do not require adjustments enhanced model monitoring confirms models are performing as intended see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of the objectives of our risk management system as well as our risk management policies and practices there have been no material changes to our approach to risk management since december credit risk management credit risk is managed through a robust risk identification and control framework which outlines clear and consistent policies principles and guidance for risk managers credit risk is monitored using various internal risk management measures and within limits approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities our credit risk management procedures are designed for all stages of economic and financial cycles including challenging periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty during the first quarter of the future economic environment remained uncertain amidst high inflation rising interest rates and slowing economic growth we continue to monitor the performance of our material commercial loans as conditions evolve and take necessary credit actions where warranted see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of our approach to credit risk treasury risk management we continuously monitor our capital ratios and the

to capital risk management including our capital ratios and regulatory capital requirements liquidity and funding risk as part of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management we employ the measures discussed below to define monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with hsbc policy hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa are subject to the us liquidity coverage ratio lcr rule which is designed to be a shortterm liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets hqla to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next days and are required to report their lcr to us regulators on a daily basis during the three hsbc usa inc months ended march hsbc bank usas lcr remained above percent under the tailoring rules a percent lcr requirement applies to category iv firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding that equals or exceeds billion and their depository institution subsidiaries as a result a lcr of percent or higher reflects an unencumbered hqla balance that is equal to or exceeds percent of a category iv firms liquidity needs for a calendar day liquidity stress scenario hqla consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa are also subject to the us net stable funding ratio nsfr rule which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities at both march and december hsbc bank usas nsfr exceeded percent under the tailoring rules a percent nsfr requirement applies to category iv firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding that equals or exceeds billion and their depository institution subsidiaries as a result a nsfr of percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next months that is equal to or exceeds percent of a category iv firms required amount of funding for assets and offbalance sheet exposures in addition under the uk prudential regulatory authority pra based nsfr rule hsbc usas nsfr exceeded percent at both march and december under the uk pra nsfr rule a nsfr of percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of funding for assets and offbalance sheet exposures as a category iv firm hsbc north america remains subject to liquidity stress testing and related liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa have liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules and may need to make changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future rules our liquidity and funding risk management approach includes deposits supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans in addition regulations require banks to retain a portfolio of hqla as such we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong ratings from the major credit rating agencies the following table reflects the short

provided to our equity holder under a managed runoff scenario an eve sensitivity represents the change in eve due to a defined movement in interest rates we manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of basis points to the market implied interest rates at both march and december our eve remained within risk limits for the up and down basis point interest rate shock scenarios net interest income simulation modeling techniques we utilize simulation modeling to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income these techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various scenarios such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by basis hsbc usa inc points as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by basis points over a twelve month period in the gradual scenarios percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter the following table reflects the impact on our projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques march december amount amount dollars are in millions estimated increase decrease in projected net interest income reflects projected rate movements on april and january respectively resulting from a gradual basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from a gradual basis point decrease in the yield curve other significant scenarios monitored reflects projected rate movements on april and january respectively resulting from an immediate basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from an immediate basis point decrease in the yield curve the projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality size and composition of the balance sheet therefore although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity actual results will differ from these estimates possibly by significant amounts nontrading value at risk var nontrading var predominantly relates to markets treasury and represents the potential negative

maximum minimum at december portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types it represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types for example foreign exchange interest rate and credit spread together in one portfolio it is measured as the difference between the sum of the var by individual risk type and the combined total var a negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification as the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures the total var is nonadditive across risk types due to diversification effects for presentation purposes portfolio diversification of the var for trading portfolios includes varbased risknotinvar refer to treasury risk management above for disclosure of our nontrading var backtesting we routinely validate the accuracy of our var models by backtesting them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes nonmodeled items such as fees commissions and revenues of intraday transactions from the actual reported profit and loss we would expect under stable market conditions to experience two or three losses in excess of var at the percent confidence level over a oneyear period however in periods of unstable market conditions we could see an increase in the number of backtesting exceptions during the first quarter of we experienced no loss backtesting exceptions hsbc usa inc
