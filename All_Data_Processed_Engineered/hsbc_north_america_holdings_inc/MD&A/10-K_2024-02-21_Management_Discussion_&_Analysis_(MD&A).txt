compliance with federal securities laws table start hsbc usa inc table end our material risks the principal risks associated with our operations include the following credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract treasury risk is the risk of having insufficient capital liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements including the risk of an adverse impact on earnings or capital due to changes in market interest rates together with pension risk market risk is the risk of an adverse financial impact on trading activities arising from changes in market parameters such as interest rates foreign exchange rates asset prices volatilities correlations and credit spreads climate risk relates to the financial and nonfinancial impacts that may arise as a consequence of climate change and the move to a net zero economy resilience risk is the risk of sustained and significant business disruption from execution delivery physical security or safety events causing the inability to provide critical services to our customers affiliates and counterparties regulatory compliance risk is the risk associated with breaching our duty to clients and other counterparties inappropriate market conduct and breaching related financial services regulatory standards financial crime risk is the risk that our products and services will be exploited for criminal activity including fraud bribery and corruption tax evasion sanctions and export control violations money laundering terrorist financing and proliferation financing strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify execute and react appropriately to opportunities andor threats arising from changes in the market some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances customer requirements demographic trends regulatory developments or competitor action and model risk is the risk of inappropriate or incorrect business decisions arising from the use of models that have been inadequately designed implemented or used or from models that do not perform in line with expectations and predictions credit risk management credit risk is managed through a robust risk identification and control framework which outlines clear and consistent policies principles and guidance for risk managers credit risk is monitored using various internal risk management measures and within limits approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities the principle objectives of credit risk management are to maintain a strong culture of responsible lending and robust risk policies and control frameworks both partner with and challenge our businesses in defining implementing and continually reevaluating our risk appetite under actual and scenario conditions and ensure there is independent scrutiny of credit risks their cost and their mitigation credit risk arises from various on and offbalance sheet instruments and arrangements such as loan portfolios investment portfolios unfunded commitments such as letters of credit and lines of credit and unutilized credit card lines that customers can draw upon and derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps which may represent an exposure to the counterparty to the contract while credit risk exists widely in our operations diversification among various commercial and consumer portfolios helps to lessen risk exposure daytoday management of credit risk is performed by the chief credit officer and the wpb chief risk officer who report directly to the cro and maintain independent risk functions the credit risk associated with wholesale commercial portfolios is managed by the chief credit officer while credit risk associated with retail consumer loan portfolios is managed by the wpb chief risk officer further discussion of credit risk can be found under the credit quality caption in this mda our credit risk management procedures are designed for all stages of economic and financial cycles including challenging periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty the credit risk function continues to refine early warning indicators and reporting including stress testing scenarios on the basis of recent experience stress testing results are taken into consideration within our business planning process action has been taken where necessary to improve our resilience to risks associated with the current market conditions by selectively discontinuing business lines or products closely managing underwriting criteria and investing in improved fraud prevention technologies at december economic uncertainty remains due to elevated interest rates inflation levels and the expectation for slowing economic growth we continue to monitor the performance of our material commercial loans as conditions evolve and take necessary credit actions where warranted table start hsbc usa inc table end the responsibilities of the credit risk function include formulating credit risk policies our policies are designed to ensure that all of our various retail and wholesale business units operate within clear standards of acceptable credit risk our policies ensure that the hsbc standards are consistently implemented across all businesses and that all regulatory requirements are also considered credit policies are reviewed and approved annually at the rmm and the risk committee of the board of directors approving new credit exposures and independently assessing large exposures annually credit approval authorities are delegated by the board of directors to the ceo and subsequently subdelegated to the cro with the authority to subdelegate to the chief credit officer and wpb chief risk officer the chief credit officer and wpb chief risk officer in turn delegate limited credit authority to the various lending units however most wholesale credits are reviewed and approved centrally through a dedicated credit approval unit that reports directly to the chief credit officer in addition the chief credit officer coordinates the review of material credits with hsbc group credit risk which subject to certain agreedupon limits will concur on material new and renewal transactions large retail credits are escalated to the wpb chief risk officer for review and concurrence overseeing retail credit and collateral risk the wpb chief risk officer manages the credit and collateral risk associated with retail portfolios supported by expertise from a dedicated advanced risk analytics unit collateral risk in retail arises when the underlying value of the property securing a retail loan loses value due to macroeconomic housing market or industry conditions this risk is actively managed through ongoing monitoring of house price indices in the metropolitan statistical areas in which the mortgage portfolio is concentrated in areas where property values are declining maximum ltv requirements will be adjusted downward to compensate for this risk maintaining and developing the governance and operation of the wholesale risk rating system a twodimensional credit risk rating system is utilized in order to categorize exposures meaningfully and enable focused management of the risks involved this rating system comprises a category customer risk rating which considers the probability of default of an obligor and a separate facility risk rating representing an assessment of the obligors expected performance in servicing its obligations in accordance with the terms rating methodologies are based upon a wide range of analytics and market databased tools which are core inputs to the assessment of counterparty risk although automated risk rating processes are increasingly used for larger facilities the ultimate responsibility for setting risk ratings rests in each case with the final approving executive risk ratings are reviewed frequently and amendments where necessary are implemented promptly measuring portfolio credit risk we continue to advance the measurement of the risk in our credit portfolios using techniques such as stress testing in certain internal reporting efforts continue to refine both the inputs and assumptions used to increase the usefulness in the evaluation of large and small commercial and retail customer portfolio products and business unit return on risk monitoring portfolio performance credit data warehouses have been implemented to centralize the reporting of credit risk support the analysis of risk and to calculate credit loss reserves these data warehouses also support hsbcs wider effort to meet the requirements of basel iii and to generate credit reports for management and the risk committee of the board of directors establishing counterparty and portfolio limits we monitor and limit our wholesale exposure to individual counterparties and to the combined exposure of related counterparties in addition selected industry portfolios such as real estate are subject to caps that are recommended by the chief credit officer and reviewed where appropriate by management committees and the risk committee of the board of directors retail establishes portfolio limits by product as well as limits on new products and higherrisk segments such as investment property high ltv mortgages and credit cards these limits are approved by the wpb chief risk officer and monitored by a retail credit risk management committee counterparty credit exposure related to derivative activities is also managed under approved limits since the exposure related to derivatives is variable and uncertain internal risk management methodologies are used to calculate the percent worstcase potential future exposure for each customer these methodologies take into consideration among other factors crossproduct closeout netting collateral received from customers under collateral support annexes termination clauses and offsetting positions within the portfolio managing problem loans special attention is paid to problem loans when appropriate our wholesale special credits unit and retail collection and recovery teams provide customers with intensive management and support in order to help them avoid default wherever possible and maximize recoveries establishing allowances for credit losses the chief credit officer and the wpb chief risk officer share responsibility with the chief financial officer for establishing appropriate levels of allowances for credit losses inherent in our various loan and other portfolios carried at amortized cost this responsibility includes overseeing the processes for model performance monitoring and redevelopment of new models establishing forwardlooking economic scenarios projecting results from the impairment calculation engine and determining management judgment utilized for estimating lifetime ecl management review committees comprising representatives from table start hsbc usa inc table end credit risk and finance have been established in order to review and challenge the results of the lifetime ecl calculations before approving them each period credit review is an independent and critical second lod function its mission is to identify and evaluate areas of credit risk within our business credit review will focus on the review and evaluation of wholesale and retail lending activities and will identify risks and provide an ongoing assessment as to the effectiveness of the risk management framework and the related portfolios credit review will independently assess the business units and risk management functions to ensure the portfolios are managed and operating in a manner that is consistent with hsbc group strategy risk appetite appropriate local and hsbc group credit policies and procedures and applicable regulatory requirements for example this includes the unilateral authority to independently assess and revise customer risk ratings facility risk ratings and loss given default estimates to ensure its independent stature the credit review delegation of authority is endorsed by the risk committee of the board of directors which grants the head of credit review unhindered access to the risk committee and executive sessions at the discretion of the head of credit review accordingly our risk committee of the board of directors has oversight of the credit review annual and ongoing plan quarterly plan updates and results of reviews treasury risk management treasury risk arises from changes to the respective resources and risk profiles driven by customer behavior management decisions or the external environment treasury risks including capital liquidity and funding and interest rate risk are owned and actively managed on an ongoing basis by the treasurer supported by alco capital risk is the risk that we fail to meet our regulatory capital requirements capital risk arises from a deterioration in the capital base due to losses and increased risk profile from management activity or the external environment we aim to maintain a strong capital base to support the risks inherent in our business and invest in accordance with our strategy meeting regulatory capital requirements at all times see liquidity and capital resources in this mda for a full discussion of our approach to capital risk management including our capital ratios and regulatory capital requirements liquidity and funding risk is the risk that we do not have sufficient financial resources to meet our obligations as they fall due or that we cannot raise funding or can only do so at excessive cost liquidity and funding risk arises from mismatches in the timing of cash flows or when illiquid asset positions cannot be funded at the expected terms and when required we continuously monitor the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our liquidity and funding framework to reflect market events and the evolving regulatory landscape and view as to best practices historically we have seen the greatest strain in the wholesale market as opposed to the retail market the latter being the market from which we source stable demand and time deposit accounts which are less sensitive to market events or changes in interest rates liquidity is managed to provide the ability to generate cash to meet lending deposit withdrawal and other commitments at a reasonable cost in a reasonable amount of time while maintaining routine operations and market confidence market funding is coordinated with other hsbc group entities as the markets increasingly view debt issuances from the separate companies within the context of our common parent company liquidity and funding risk management is performed at the hsbc north america hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa levels each entity is required to have sufficient liquidity for a crisis situation liquidity risk policies and procedures have been implemented to ensure that the minimum liquidity ratios and a strong overall liquidity position are maintained alco projects cash flow requirements and determines the level of liquid assets and available funding sources to have at our disposal with consideration given to anticipated deposit and balance sheet growth contingent liabilities and the ability to access wholesale funding markets in addition to base case projections multiple stress scenarios are generated to simulate crisis conditions including runoff of nonstable deposits inability to renew maturing interbank funding drawdowns of committed loan facilities decreases in the market value of liquid securities additional collateral requirements for derivative transactions under existing collateral support agreements rating downgrades of hsbc usa or hsbc bank usa and increased discount on security values for repos or disposals in addition alco monitors the overall mix of deposit and funding concentrations to avoid undue reliance on individual funding sources and large deposit relationships as part of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management we employ the measures discussed below to define monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with hsbc policy hsbc north america is subject to the us liquidity coverage ratio lcr rule which is designed to be a shortterm liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets hqla to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next days and both hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa calculate and report their lcr to us regulators on a daily table start hsbc usa inc table end basis during hsbc bank usas lcr remained above percent under the tailoring rules a percent lcr requirement applies to category iv firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding that equals or exceeds billion as a result a lcr of percent or higher reflects an unencumbered hqla balance that is equal to or exceeds percent of a category iv firms liquidity needs for a calendar day liquidity stress scenario hqla consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets hsbc north america is also subject to the us net stable funding ratio nsfr rule which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities and both hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa calculate and report their nsfr to us regulators at both december and hsbc bank usas nsfr exceeded percent under the tailoring rules a percent nsfr requirement applies to category iv firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding that equals or exceeds billion as a result a nsfr of percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next months that is equal to or exceeds percent of a category iv firms required amount of funding for assets and offbalance sheet exposures in addition under the united kingdom uk prudential regulatory authority pra based nsfr rule hsbc usas nsfr exceeded percent at both december and under the uk pra nsfr rule a nsfr of percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of funding for assets and offbalance sheet exposures as a category iv firm hsbc north america is subject to liquidity stress testing and related liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa have liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules and may need to make changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future rules alco also maintains a liquidity management and contingency funding plan contingency funding plan which identifies certain potential early warning indicators of liquidity problems and actions that can be taken both initially and in the event of a liquidity crisis to minimize the longterm impact on our businesses and customer relationships the contingency funding plan is reviewed annually and approved by the risk committee of the board of directors we recognize a liquidity crisis can either be specific to us relating to our ability to meet our obligations in a timely manner or marketwide caused by a macro risk event in the broader financial system a range of indicators are monitored to attain an early warning of any liquidity issues these include widening of key spreads or indices used to track market volatility material reductions or extreme volatility in customer deposit balances increased utilization of credit lines widening of our own credit spreads and higher borrowing costs at the onset of a crisis liquidity needs would be satisfied primarily with unsecured wholesale market funding depending on the scenario if the crisis escalates contingency funding needs will be satisfied primarily through monetization of the liquid asset buffer we maintain consisting of cash shortterm liquid assets and unencumbered government and other highly rated investment securities as a source of funding further collateral is maintained at the federal reserve bank and the fhlb including portions of the mortgage portfolio providing additional secured borrowing capacity in a liquidity crisis in addition to the oversight provided by alco treasury risk management trm is a second lod oversight function for treasury riskrelated activities including capital liquidity and funding and interest rate risk which is led by the head of traded and treasury risk management and risk analytics who is the accountable risk steward for treasury risks and independently reports into the cro trms primary mandate is to strengthen our treasury risk management framework through review and challenge of existing processes and recommending areas that need improvement to the rmm trm serves as an advisory function to senior management to ensure front line units with direct responsibility for managing treasury risk are operating within their operating guidelines and defined risk appetite parameters the trm oversight mandate is carried out through critical evaluation and challenge of existing risk management processes including stress testing and ratio calculations our liquidity and funding risk management approach includes deposits supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans in addition regulations require banks to retain a portfolio of hqla as such we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities table start hsbc usa inc table end our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong ratings

regulatory developments future profitability risk management practices and legal matters all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions in october moodys downgraded the longterm debt ratings of hsbc usa by one notch including the senior debt rating which was downgraded to a2 from a1 these rating downgrades reflect moodys view that there is a decrease in loss absorbing capacity debt outstanding at hsbc north america the outlook for the senior debt ratings of hsbc usa is stable while this rating action did not have a material financial impact on our borrowing costs or liquidity any future actions could have such an impact although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future at december none of the ratings on the debt of hsbc usa or hsbc bank usa from any of the rating agencies were under review for potential downgrade numerous factors internal and external may impact access to and costs associated with issuing debt in the global capital markets these factors include our debt ratings overall economic conditions overall capital markets volatility and the effectiveness of the management of credit risks inherent in our customer base cash resources shortterm investments and a trading asset portfolio are available to provide highly liquid funding for us additional liquidity is provided by availableforsale and heldtomaturity debt securities approximately million of the debt securities in these portfolios at december are expected to mature in the remaining million of debt securities not expected to mature in are available to provide liquidity by serving as collateral for secured borrowings or if needed by being sold further liquidity is available through our ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets in in addition to the normal sales of agencyeligible mortgage loan originations we sold commercial real estate loans of approximately million to third parties it is the policy of hsbc bank usa to maintain both primary and secondary collateral in order to ensure precautionary borrowing availability from the federal reserve bank primary collateral is collateral that is physically maintained at the federal reserve bank and serves as a safety net against any unexpected funding shortfalls that may occur secondary collateral is collateral that is acceptable to the federal reserve bank but is not maintained there if unutilized borrowing capacity were to be low secondary collateral would be identified and maintained as necessary further liquidity is available from the fhlb see liquidity and capital resources in this mda for further discussion of our liquidity position including additional information regarding our outstanding borrowings the remaining availability of our debt issuance programs and our funding strategy interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income due to mismatched pricing between assets and liabilities as well as losses in value due to interest rate movements we are subject to interest rate risk associated with the repricing characteristics of our balance sheet assets and liabilities specifically as interest rates change amounts of interest earning assets and liabilities fluctuate and interest earning assets reprice at intervals that do not correspond to the maturities or repricing patterns of interest bearing liabilities this mismatch between assets and liabilities in repricing sensitivity results in changes to projected net interest income as interest rates move to help manage the risks associated with changes in interest rates and to manage net interest income within interest rate risk ranges management considers acceptable we use derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps options futures and forwards as hedges to modify the repricing characteristics of specific assets liabilities forecasted transactions or firm commitments analysis of this risk is complicated by having to make assumptions on embedded optionality within certain product areas such as the incidence of mortgage prepayments and from behavioral assumptions regarding the economic duration of liabilities which are contractually repayable on demand such as current accounts these assumptions around behavioral features are captured in our interest rate behavioralization framework which is described further below table start hsbc usa inc table end for purposes of interest rate risk our nontrading portfolios are referred to as the banking book management of interest rate risk in the banking book is governed by the hsbc groups nontrading market risk policy alco establishes our risk appetite and related limits for interest rate risk in the banking book daytoday management of interest rate risk in the banking book is centralized principally in markets treasury which includes the nontrading interest rate risk positions transferred to it from the global businesses as discussed further below we have significant but historically well controlled interest rate risk in large part due to our portfolio of residential mortgages and mortgagebacked securities which consumers can prepay without penalty and our large base of demand and savings deposits these deposits can be withdrawn by consumers at will but historically they have been a stable source of relatively low cost funds in the course of managing interest rate risk a combination of risk assessment techniques are utilized to identify and assess the potential impact of interest rate movements and take appropriate action this combination of techniques with some focusing on the impact of interest rate movements on the valuation of the balance sheet eg economic value of equity present value of a basis point repricing gap analysis value at risk and others focusing on the impact of interest rate movements on earnings eg earningsatrisk allows for comprehensive analyses from different perspectives a key element of managing interest rate risk is the management of the convexity of the balance sheet largely resulting from the mortgage related products on the balance sheet convexity risk arises as mortgage loan consumers change their payment behavior significantly in response to large movements in market rates but do not change behavior appreciably for smaller changes in market rates certain interest rate management tools such as economic value of equity and earningsatrisk better capture the embedded convexity in the balance sheet while measures such as present value of a basis point are designed to capture the risk of smaller changes in rates similarly managed rate deposits with no stated maturity experience convexity that impacts net interest income sensitivity the assessment techniques discussed below act as a guide for managing interest rate risk associated with balance sheet composition and offbalance sheet hedging strategy the risk position calculated values within limit ranges reflect an acceptable risk position although possible future unfavorable trends may prompt adjustments to on or offbalance sheet exposure calculated values outside of limit ranges will result in consideration of adjustment of the risk position or consideration of temporary dispensation from making adjustments economic value of equity eve eve represents the present value of the banking book cash flows that could be provided to our equity holder under a managed runoff scenario an eve sensitivity represents the change in eve due to a defined movement in interest rates we manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of basis points to the market implied interest rates at both december and our eve remained within risk limits for the up and down basis point interest rate shock scenarios table start hsbc usa inc table end repricing gap analysis the following table shows the repricing structure of our assets and liabilities at december for assets and liabilities whose cash flows are subject to change due to movements in interest rates such as the sensitivity of mortgage loans to prepayments data is reported based on the earlier of expected repricing or maturity and reflects anticipated prepayments based on the current rate environment the resulting gaps are reviewed to assess the potential sensitivity to earnings with respect to the direction magnitude and timing of changes in market interest rates data shown is as of yearend and

position table end table start table end includes loans held for sale various techniques are utilized to quantify and monitor risks associated with the repricing characteristics of our assets liabilities and derivative contracts earningsatrisk beginning in the fourth quarter of we replaced net interest income simulation modeling with earningsatrisk in our alco reporting as we now employ earningsatrisk as part of our approach towards interest rate risk management earningsatrisk is a measure of interest rate risk in the banking book generated by our nontrading assets and liabilities that primarily includes loans deposits with banks investment securities deposits longterm debt and any associated interest rate hedges that are not held for trading intent or in order to hedge positions held with trading intent as a result we no longer utilize net interest income simulation modeling to manage interest rate risk earningsatrisk utilizes a number of interest rate scenarios to estimate the impact on projected banking book net interest income over a twelve month period such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by basis points as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by basis points in the gradual scenarios percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter the following table reflects the estimated impact of the earningsatrisk scenarios on projected banking book net interest income table start december december amount amount dollars are in millions estimated increase decrease in projected banking book net interest income reflects projected rate movements on january and respectively resulting from a gradual basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from a gradual basis point decrease in the yield curve other significant scenarios monitored reflects projected rate movements on january and respectively resulting from an immediate basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from an immediate basis point decrease in the yield curve table end table start hsbc usa inc table end projected earningsatrisk figures represent the effect of movements in banking book net interest income based on our current interest rate risk profile and the projected yield curve scenarios which incorporate assumptions of deposit pricing loans spreads and mortgage prepayment behavior implied by the yield curves in each scenario this effect however does not incorporate actions which would probably be taken by markets treasury or in the businesses to mitigate the effect of interest rate risk in reality markets treasury seeks proactively to change the interest rate risk profile to minimize losses and optimize net revenues the earningsatrisk calculations assume that interest rates of all maturities move by the same amount in the upshock scenarios however certain interest rates are subject to flooring assumptions in the downshock scenarios in addition the calculations take account of the effect on banking book net interest income of anticipated differences in changes between interbank interest rates and interest rates over which we have discretion in terms of the timing and extent of rate changes deposit pricing sensitivities ie deposit betas are informed by historical and expected behavior the projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality size and composition of the balance sheet therefore although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity actual results will differ from these estimates possibly by significant amounts interest rate risk behavioralization unlike liquidity risk which is assessed on the basis of a very severe stress scenario interest rate risk is assessed and managed according to businessasusual conditions in many cases the contractual profile of our assets and liabilities does not reflect the behavior observed behavioralization is therefore used to assess the interest rate risk of our assets and liabilities and this assessed risk is transferred to markets treasury in accordance with the rules governing the transfer of interest rate risk from the global businesses to markets treasury behavioralization is applied in three key areas the assessed repricing frequency of managed rate balances the assessed duration of noninterest bearing balances typically capital and current accounts and the base case expected prepayment behavior or pipeline takeup rate for fixed rate balances with embedded optionality interest rate behavioralization policies have to be formulated in line with the hsbc groups behavioralization policies and approved at least annually by alco and global asset liability and capital management in conjunction with local regional and hsbc group risk monitoring teams the extent to which balances can be behavioralized is driven by the amount of the current balance that can be assessed as stable under businessasusual conditions and for managed rate balances the historic market interest rate repricing behavior observed or for noninterest bearing balances the duration for which the balance is expected to remain under businessasusual conditions this assessment is often driven by the reinvestment tenors available to markets treasury to neutralize the risk through the use of fixed rate government bonds or interest rate derivatives and for derivatives the availability of cash flow hedging capacity nontrading value at risk var nontrading var predominantly relates to markets treasury and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value which includes availableforsale and heldtomaturity assets and associated hedges our investment portfolio holdings comprise mainly us treasury us government agency mortgagebacked and us government sponsored mortgagebacked securities our nontrading var exposure is driven by interest rates and agency mortgagebacked security spread volatility refer to market risk management below for further discussion regarding var and the management of market risk in our

employees certain employees are eligible to participate in the hsbc north america qualified defined benefit pension plan which has been frozen plan assets were higher than projected plan liabilities resulting in an overfunded status of approximately million at december because these obligations relate to the hsbc north america pension plan only a portion of any future deficit could be considered our responsibility we and other hsbc north america affiliates with employees participating in this plan will be required to make up any shortfall over a number of years as specified under the pension

from such positions nontrading portfolios comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities as well as financial investments classified as availableforsale and heldtomaturity we apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and nontrading portfolios our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimize return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite the nature of the hedging and risk mitigation strategies performed corresponds to the market risk management instruments available these strategies range from the use of traditional market instruments such as interest rate swaps to more sophisticated hedging strategies to address a combination of risk factors arising at the portfolio level market risk governance market risk is managed and controlled through limits approved by the risk committee of the board of directors and the rmm as well as the various businesses and also ratified by the hsbc group risk management meeting these limits are allocated across business lines and to the hsbc group legal entities including hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa we have an independent market risk management and control function in north america which is responsible for setting the risk appetite measuring market risk exposures in accordance with the policies defined by hsbc group risk and monitoring and reporting these exposures against the prescribed limits on a daily basis table start hsbc usa inc table end model risk is governed through model oversight forums at the regional and global levels the forums have direct oversight and approval responsibility for all traded risk models utilized for risk measurement and management and stress testing they prioritize the development of models methodologies and practices used for traded risk management and ensure that they remain within our risk appetite and business plans we are committed to the ongoing development and enhancement of our inhouse risk models subject to regulatory approval refer to model risk management below for further discussion regarding the management and monitoring of model risk across north america our control of market risk in the trading and nontrading portfolios is based on a policy of restricting operations to trading within a list of permissible instruments ultimately approved by hsbc group risk as well as enforcing new product approval procedures through a dedicated committee market risk measures we use a range of tools to monitor and limit market risk exposures including sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis measures the impact of individual market factor movements on specific instruments or portfolios for example the impact of a one basis point change in the yield curve we use sensitivity analysis to monitor the market risk positions within each risk type sensitivity limits are set for portfolios products and risk types with the depth of the market being one of the principal factors in determining the level of limits set value at risk var var is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence the use of var is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalize them in addition we calculate var for nontrading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk where we do not calculate var explicitly we use alternative tools as summarized in the stress testing section below our var models are predominantly based on historical simulation which incorporates the following features historical market rates and prices are calculated with reference to foreign exchange rates commodity prices interest rates and the associated volatilities potential market movements utilized for var are calculated with reference to data from the past two years scenario profit and losses are calculated utilizing the market scenarios for all relevant risk factors and var measures are calculated to a percent confidence level and use a oneday holding period the models also incorporate the effect of option features on the underlying exposures the nature of the var models means that an increase in observed market volatility will lead to an increase in var without any changes in the underlying positions although a valuable guide to risk var should always be viewed in the context of its limitations for example the use of historical data as a proxy for estimating future events may not encompass all potential events particularly those which are extreme in nature the use of a holding period assumes that all positions can be liquidated or the risks offset during that period which may not fully reflect the market risk arising at times of severe illiquidity when the holding period may be insufficient to liquidate or hedge all positions fully the use of a percent confidence level does not take into account losses that might occur beyond this level of confidence and var is calculated on the basis of exposures outstanding at the close of business and therefore does not necessarily reflect intraday exposures the risks not in var rniv framework aims to capture and capitalize material market risks that are not adequately covered in the var model risk factors are reviewed on a regular basis and either incorporated directly in the var models where possible or quantified through the rniv rniv stresses interest rate basis risk exposure and interest rate volatility skewness rniv riskweighted assets make up approximately percent of husi market risk riskweighted assets and the contribution to total husi riskweighted assets remains immaterial stressed var stressed var is primarily used for regulatory capital purposes and is integrated into the risk management process to facilitate efficient capital management stressed var complements other risk measures by providing severe potential losses associated with stressed market conditions stressed var modeling follows the same approach as var except stressed var calculates potential loss at a percent confidence level for a oneday holding period based on a one year historical period that is calibrated to the most volatile period for the trading portfolio stress testing stress testing is an important procedure that is integrated into our market risk management framework to evaluate the potential impact on portfolio values of more extreme although plausible events or movements in a set of financial variables in such scenarios losses can be much greater than those predicted by var modeling table start hsbc usa inc table end a set of scenarios is used consistently across the hsbc group scenarios are tailored to capture the relevant potential events or market movements at each level the risk appetite around potential stress losses is set and monitored against corresponding limits the process is governed by the stress testing review group forum which in conjunction with regional risk management determines the scenarios to be applied main scenario types are as follows single risk factor stress scenarios that are unlikely to be captured within the var models such as the break of a currency peg technical scenarios that incorporate the largest move in each risk factor independent from any underlying market correlation hypothetical scenarios are mainly built on potential macroeconomic events for example a worsening global energy crisis and the potential effects of a sovereign debt default including its wider contagion effects curves steepening or flattening scenarios and historical scenarios which incorporate past observations of market movements during periods of stress which are not captured within var market risk reverse stress tests are undertaken on the premise that there is a fixed loss the stress testing process identifies which scenarios lead to this loss the rationale behind the reverse stress test is to understand scenarios which are beyond normal business conditions and could have contagion and systemic implications stressed var and stress testing together with reverse stress testing provide management with insights regarding the tail risk beyond var for which our appetite is limited market risk in the global market environment remained volatile in centered around central bank policy actions economic data and stress in the banking sector which was especially prevalent in the first half of the year the frb raised its policy rate by basis points during the year leading to volatility in the fixed income markets the 10year us treasury yield traded within a broad range ending the year nearly unchanged at percent but hitting a high of percent and a low of percent exemplifying the market volatility credit markets remained strong however certain sectors came under pressure like regional banks certain pockets of technology and other highyielding credits trading var trading var is generated principally from trading activities within the mss segment of gbm these include positions in interest rates foreign exchange precious metals ie gold silver platinum and credit default swaps in september we entered into derivative transactions to transfer the substantial majority of the market risk associated with our precious metals trading positions to hsbc bank plc where it will be centrally managed going forward trading var at december was lower as compared with december due to the transfer of precious metal market risk to hsbc bank plc as discussed above as well as changes in market conditions that favor reduced overall risk exposure the following graph summarizes daily var for our trading portfolios at a percent confidence level in millions table start hsbc usa inc table end the following table

december full year average maximum minimum table end table start table end portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types it represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types for example foreign exchange interest rate and credit spread together in one portfolio it is measured as the difference between the sum of the var by individual risk type and the combined total var a negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification as the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures the total var is nonadditive across risk types due to diversification effects for presentation purposes portfolio diversification of the var for trading portfolios includes varbased risknotinvar refer to treasury risk management above for disclosure of our nontrading var backtesting we routinely validate the accuracy of our var models by backtesting them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes nonmodeled items such as fees commissions and revenues of intraday transactions from the actual reported profit and loss we would expect under stable market conditions to experience two or three losses in excess of var at the percent confidence level over a oneyear period however in periods of unstable market conditions we could see an increase in the number of backtesting exceptions during we experienced one loss backtesting exception in the fourth quarter due primarily to increased market volatility in interest rates and credit spreads stressed var the following table reflects stressed var at december and table start at december in
