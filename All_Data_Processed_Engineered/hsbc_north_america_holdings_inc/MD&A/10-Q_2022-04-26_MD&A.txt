our economic environment the us economy continued its recovery during the first quarter of despite pressures from higher inflation and rising energy prices as well as concerns over the russiaukraine war and the continued economic uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic inflation remains elevated reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and higher energy prices as well as other broader price pressures and is currently forecast to exceed an annual rate of percent in the first quarter of well above the frbs target inflation rate in addition the russiaukraine war and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity as previously discussed the covid19 pandemic has resulted in disruption to business and economic activity while the omicron variant took covid19 infection rates to a new high in january covid19 cases declined by the end of the first quarter however the duration of the pandemic including the emergence of new variants and the ultimate repercussions continue to remain unclear us gross domestic product gdp is currently forecast to grow at an annual rate in excess of percent in the first quarter of while the us economy added over thousand jobs during the first quarter of and the total unemployment rate fell to percent at march as compared with percent at december in march the frb increased shortterm interest rates by basis points and indicated that ongoing increases in shortterm interest rates will occur in in order to fight inflation although the us economy continued to grow during the first quarter of the impacts of higher inflation rising energy prices and the russiaukraine war in addition to the continuing impact of the covid19 pandemic on economic conditions both in the united states and abroad have created significant uncertainty about the future economic environment which will continue to evolve and impact our business in future periods while our credit risk exposure to russia was immaterial at march it is difficult to anticipate the full effect of sanctions announced to date on our business and on our customers concerns over interest rate levels energy prices domestic and global policy issues trade policy in the us and geopolitical events as well as the implications of those events on the markets in general further add to the global uncertainty interest rate levels and energy prices in combination with global economic conditions fiscal and monetary policy and the level of regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in and beyond performance developments and trends we continue to progress our strategic plan to restructure our operations restructuring plan as discussed further in

transaction costs see note branch assets and liabilities held for sale in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information in addition to the branch disposal group discussed above during the first quarter of we sold a portfolio of consumer loans to a third party consisting primarily of certain nonperforming mortgage loans and governmentbacked mortgage loans that

with million during the three months ended march income before income tax was million during the three months ended march compared with million during the three months ended march the decrease in income before income tax during the three months ended march was due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses which reflected a release in credit loss reserves driven by improved economic conditions in the prior year period and to a lesser extent lower net interest income in these decreases were partially offset by higher other revenues driven by the gain on sale of the branch disposal group as discussed above hsbc usa inc our reported results in all periods were impacted by certain items management believes to be significant which affect comparability between periods significant

quality for additional discussion on our credit trends london interbank offered rate libor transition regulators and central banks in various national jurisdictions continue to actively work to help transition from interbank offered rates to acceptable alternative rates such as the secured overnight financing rate sofr recommended by the alternative reference rates committee convened by the frb in march the adjustable interest rate act libor act was signed into law in order to provide a federal solution for transitioning certain legacy liborbased contracts which do not specify a replacement rate or contain an adequate fallback mechanism the libor act will automatically transition such contracts to a sofrbased replacement rate as of july and requires the frb to issue a regulation within days identifying which version of sofr will apply in addition the libor act provides a safe harbor that no eligible person will be subject to legal liability arising out of their selection of a sofrbased replacement for libor including banks that had previously selected a nonsofrbased libor replacement this federal legislation establishes a clear and uniform process for replacing libor in legacy contracts that are particularly difficult to amend and provides muchneeded legal certainty that is likely to diminish the amount of litigation associated with the cessation of libor we continue to actively participate in hsbcs global transition program with the objective of facilitating an orderly transition of all products processes models and curves as well as all legacy liborbased contracts onto replacement rates the current focus of our client transition efforts is on those remaining contracts that will be impacted by usd libor tenors ceasing or becoming nonrepresentative immediately after june such contracts outstanding at march included contracts for nonderivative financial assets with a carrying value of approximately billion primarily consisting of usd liborbased loans contracts for nonderivative financial liabilities with a carrying value of approximately billion primarily consisting of usd liborbased longterm debt and contracts for usd liborbased derivatives with a notional value of approximately billion the substantial majority of our outstanding usd liborbased derivative contracts adhere to and are covered by the international swaps and derivatives association fallback protocol the ability of husi and its clients to transition legacy contracts onto replacement rates is dependent on the availability of products that reference replacement rates including sofr and on our customers being ready and able to adapt their own processes and systems to accommodate the replacement products market readiness in support of usd libor transition could slow the transition and we remain prepared that the transition of outstanding contracts could be concentrated in late and the first half of we continue to engage with industry participants the official sector and our clients to support an orderly transition and the mitigation of the risks resulting from the transition for further discussion of our libor transition program and the associated risks

standards ifrss as issued by the iasb as a result our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of hsbc groups accounting and reporting policies group reporting basis because operating results on the group reporting basis are used in managing our businesses and rewarding performance of employees our management also separately monitors profit

reporting basis the significant differences between us gaap and the group reporting basis as they impact our results are summarized in note business segments in our form 10k there have been no significant changes since december in the differences between us gaap and the group reporting basis impacting our results differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for the periods presented are explained below during the first quarter of expected credit losses were higher under us gaap than under the group reporting basis under the group reporting basis a majority of our loans are considered to be in stage which requires a 12month expected credit losses estimate while under us gaap such loans require a lifetime expected credit losses lifetime ecl estimate primarily as a result of the different requirements the impact of higher loss estimates associated with loan growth and maturity extensions was more pronounced under us gaap during the first quarter of expected credit losses were lower under us gaap than under the group reporting basis primarily as a result of the different requirements related to stage loans discussed above releases in credit reserves driven by improved economic conditions which resulted in improved economic forecasts used to calculate expected credit losses and improvements in credit conditions associated with certain clients were more pronounced under us gaap client paydowns also contributed to the higher releases in credit reserves under us gaap during the first quarter of loans held for sale in the table above reflects a provision for expected credit losses associated with certain loans that are classified as held for sale under us gaap but do not meet the more stringent criteria for held for sale under the group reporting basis the impact of the provision for expected credit losses was partially offset by a higher gain on loan sales under the group reporting basis than under us gaap which includes the gain on sale of the branch disposal group the higher gain under the group reporting basis was due primarily to the releases of credit loss reserves previously recorded on the loans under us gaap when they were transferred to held for sale in also contributing to the higher gain under the group reporting basis was the higher carrying amount of leasehold improvements associated with the sold branches under us gaap at the time of sale these leasehold improvements were previously determined to be impaired and writtenoff under the group reporting basis hsbc usa inc

origination updated by the change in the federal housing finance agencys house price index hpi at either a core based statistical area or state level the estimated value of the homes could differ from

precious metal positions may not represent our net underlying exposure as we may use derivatives contracts to reduce our risk associated with these positions the fair value of which would appear in

interest income increased during the three months ended march due to higher yields reflecting the impact of higher market rates trading securities interest income increased during the three months

offset within trading revenue by the performance of the associated derivatives as discussed further below securities interest income was lower during the three months ended march due primarily to

credit risk associated with derivatives is measured as the net replacement cost of derivative contracts in a receivable position in the event the counterparties of such contracts fail to perform under the terms of those contracts in managing derivative credit risk both the current exposure which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered counterparties to our derivative activities include financial institutions central clearing parties foreign and domestic government agencies corporations funds mutual funds hedge funds etc insurance companies and private clients as well as other hsbc entities these counterparties are subject to regular credit review by the credit risk management department to minimize credit risk we may enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events in addition we reduce credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties the determination of the need for and the levels of collateral will differ based on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty andor regulatory requirements the total risk in a derivative contract is a function of a number of variables such as volatility of interest rates currencies equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments current market events or trends country risk maturity and liquidity of contracts creditworthiness of the counterparties in the transaction the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties and existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures the table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the general riskbased capital rules of the basel iii standardized approach which includes the net positive marktomarket of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount the regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and therefore allow for reductions of riskweighted assets when netting requirements have been met and collateral exists as a result riskweighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures furthermore many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral in addition many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date as a result these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital rules march december in millions risk associated with derivative contracts total credit risk exposure less collateral

be fully reflected at january we manage capital in accordance with hsbc group policy the hsbc north america internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap works in conjunction with the hsbc groups icaap the hsbc north america icaap applies to hsbc bank usa and evaluates regulatory capital adequacy and capital adequacy under various stress scenarios our approach is to meet our capital needs for these stress scenarios locally through activities which reduce risk to the extent that local alternatives are insufficient as a whollyowned subsidiary of hsbc we would seek support from our ultimate parent regulatory capital requirements are based on the amount of capital required to be held plus applicable capital buffers as defined by regulations and the amount of riskweighted assets and leverage exposure also calculated based on regulatory definitions we are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by us banking regulators including basel iii the basel iii rule the basel iii rule establishes minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for banks and bank holding companies bhcs hsbc north america hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa each calculate their riskbased capital requirements for credit risk under the standardized approach in the basel iii rule in the frb and the other federal banking agencies jointly finalized rules to implement the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act that tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards for large bhc and foreign banking organizations the tailoring rules the tailoring rules assign each bhc and ihc with billion or more in total us assets into one of five classifications categories i through iv and other firms based on its size and four riskbased indicators as of january hsbc north america met the criteria to be reclassified as a category iv firm and as a result of this classification change hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa are no longer subject to the supplementary leverage ratio or the countercyclical capital buffer prior to january hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa were subject to category iii standards for additional discussion of the basel iii rule requirements including required minimum capital ratios as well as further discussion of the tailoring rules category iv standards and other related regulatory developments and their expected impact see part i regulation and competition regulatory capital and liquidity requirements in our form 10k we continue to review the composition of our capital structure and capital buffers in light of these developments capital planning and stress testing the frb requires certain us toptier bhcs and ihcs including hsbc north america to comply with the frbs capital plan rule and ccar program as well as the supervisory stress tests conducted by the frb the stress tests are forward looking exercises to assess the impact of hypothetical macroeconomic baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the frb on the financial condition and capital adequacy of a ccar firm over a nine quarter planning horizon as a result of its reclassification as a category iv firm hsbc north america is no longer subject to companyrun stress testing and related disclosure requirements category iv firms are subject to supervisory stress testing on an everyotheryear basis although they may opt into such testing in an off year in order to recalibrate their stress capital buffer based on their most recent supervisory stress test the frb continues to supervise category iv firms on an ongoing basis including evaluation of the capital adequacy and capital planning processes during offcycle years for further discussion of capital planning and stress testing including detail regarding the frbs supervisory assessment as part of the ccar process see part i regulation and competition regulatory capital and liquidity requirements in our form 10k hsbc usa inc hsbc north america submitted its ccar capital plan in april the frb will publicly disclose its ccar and supervisory stress test results on or before june stress testing results are based solely on hypothetical adverse stress scenarios and should not be viewed or interpreted as forecasts of expected outcomes or capital adequacy or of the actual financial condition of hsbc north america capital planning and stress testing for hsbc north america may impact our future capital and liquidity while bhc regulatory capital compliance is generally performed at the hsbc north america level and also separately for hsbc bank usa as a bhc we are required to meet minimum capital requirements imposed by the frb we present our capital ratios together with hsbc bank usas in note retained earnings and regulatory capital requirements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements funding strategy our current estimate for funding needs and sources for are summarized in the following table actual january through march estimated april through december estimated full year in billions increase decrease in funding needs net change in loans net change in shortterm investments and securities net change in trading and other assets total funding needs increase decrease in funding sources net change in deposits net change in trading and other shortterm liabilities net change in longterm debt total funding sources the above table reflects a longterm funding strategy daily balances fluctuate as we accommodate customer needs while ensuring that we have liquidity in place to support the balance sheet maturity funding profile should market conditions deteriorate we have contingency plans to generate additional liquidity through the sales of assets or financing transactions we remain confident in our ability to access the market for longterm debt funding needs in the current market environment we continue to seek wellpriced and stable customer deposits we also continue to sell new agencyeligible conforming residential mortgage loans to third parties hsbc bank usa is subject to significant restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to and certain other covered transactions with hsbc usa and other affiliates for further discussion see part i regulation and competition affiliate transaction restrictions in our form 10k see risk management in this mda for further discussion relating to our liquidity contingency plans and our approach to liquidity and funding risk management offbalance sheet arrangements as part of our normal operations we enter into credit derivatives and various offbalance sheet arrangements with affiliates and third parties these arrangements arise principally in connection with our lending and client intermediation activities and involve primarily commitments to extend credit and in certain cases guarantees commitments to extend credit include arrangements whereby we are contractually obligated to extend credit in the form of loans participations in loans lease financing receivables or similar transactions at march and december we had commitments to extend credit totaling billion and billion respectively comprised primarily of commercial commitments and to a lesser extent consumer commitments commercial commitments comprise primarily those related to secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit consumer commitments comprise unused mastercardvisa credit card lines where we have the right to change terms or conditions upon notification to the customer and commitments to extend credit secured by residential properties where we have the right to change terms or conditions for cause upon notification to the customer for a summary of guarantees including standby letters of credit and certain credit derivative transactions as well as the contractual amounts outstanding at march and december see note guarantee arrangements pledged asset and repurchase agreements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default in addition implementation of our business hsbc usa inc strategy as described under the heading executive overview events in our form 10k will affect our contractual obligations over time including with respect to consumer commitments as a result we believe that the contractual amount is not representative of the actual future credit exposure or funding requirements our offbalance sheet arrangements also include transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities vies see note variable interest entities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of these unconsolidated vies fair value fair value hierarchy fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability the fair value framework the fair value framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants assumptions it emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs for financial instruments carried at fair value the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market level where the market for a financial instrument is not active valuation techniques are used the majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument level because level and level instruments are determined by observable inputs less judgment is applied in determining their fair values in the absence of observable market inputs the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs level the determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve we consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price the level of bidask spreads a lack of pricing transparency due to among other things complexity of the product and market liquidity whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data and whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities a financial instrument is classified as a level measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the overthecounter otc market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume we regard financial instruments such as debt securities equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded nonexchangetraded instruments classified as level assets include securities issued by the us treasury tobeannounced securities noncallable securities issued by us government sponsored enterprises and certain foreign governmentbacked debt level inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as level inputs we classify mortgage passthrough securities agency and certain nonagency mortgage collateralized obligations nonexchangetraded derivative contracts assetbacked securities obligations of us states and political subdivisions corporate debt securities certain foreign governmentbacked debt preferred securities securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements precious metals certain loans held for sale certain student loans residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral and real estate owned as level measurements where possible at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments we have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the third party pricing services to ensure that pricing information meets the fair value objective and where appropriate this pricing data is backtested to market trade executions where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value we investigate and reconcile the differences if the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value the instrument will be classified as level within the fair value hierarchy in general we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a nonderivative instrument level derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity the fair value of certain derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable indices traded in the otc market appropriate control processes and hsbc usa inc procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors level inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability that is level inputs incorporate market participants assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk we develop level inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances at march and december our level measurements included the following certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded derivatives have significant unobservable inputs eg volatility or default correlations certain assetbacked securities individually assessed commercial loans mortgage servicing rights derivatives with certain inputs which are unobservable certain credit default swaps certain loans held for sale and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of visa class b shares for which the fair value is dependent upon the final resolution of the related litigation see note fair value measurements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on level inputs level measurements the following table provides information about level assetsliabilities in relation to total assetsliabilities measured at fair value at march and december march december  are in millions level assets total assets measured at fair value level liabilities total liabilities measured at fair value level assets as a percent of total assets measured at fair value level liabilities as a percent of total liabilities measured at fair value presented without netting which allows the offsetting of amounts relating to certain contracts if certain conditions are met includes million of recurring level assets and million of nonrecurring level assets at march includes million of recurring level assets and million of nonrecurring level assets at december includes million of assets measured on a recurring basis and million of assets measured on a nonrecurring basis at march includes million of assets measured on a recurring basis and million of assets measured on a nonrecurring basis at december significant changes in fair value for level assets and liabilities during the first quarter of we sold certain loans which were transferred to held for sale during and were level assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis see note loans held for sale in the accompany consolidated financial statements for additional information see note fair value measurements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into out of level measurements during the three months ended march and as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value effect of changes in significant unobservable inputs the fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by derived from or corroborated by observable market data the resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value measurements of these financial instruments for the purpose of preparing the financial statements the final valuation inputs selected are based on managements best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities the unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures when we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately million or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement of approximately million at march the effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of certain creditlinked structured notes hsbc usa inc risk management overview managing risk effectively is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities we use a comprehensive risk management framework across the organization and across all risk types underpinned by our risk culture this framework fosters continuous monitoring promotes risk awareness and encourages sound operational and strategic decisionmaking it also ensures a consistent approach to identifying assessing managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities our board of directors has the ultimate responsibility for effective oversight of risk management it is advised on risk matters by the risk committee of the board of directors notably risk appetite and its alignment with our strategy risk governance and internal controls as well as highlevel risk related matters robust risk governance and accountability are embedded throughout our business through an established framework that helps to ensure appropriate oversight of and accountability for the effective management of risk our material risks the principal risks associated with our operations include the following credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract treasury risk is the risk of having insufficient capital liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements including pension risk treasury risk also includes the risk to our earnings due to changes in market interest rates market risk is the risk that movements in market factors such as foreign exchange rates interest rates credit spreads equity prices and commodity prices will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios resilience risk is the risk that we are unable to provide critical services to our customers affiliates and counterparties as a result of sustained and significant operational disruption regulatory compliance risk is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of relevant laws codes rules regulations and standards of good market practice which as a consequence incur fines and penalties and suffer damage to our business financial crime risk is the risk that we knowingly or unknowingly help parties to commit or to further potentially illegal activity including money laundering fraud bribery and corruption tax evasion sanctions breaches and terrorist and proliferation financing strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify execute and react appropriately to opportunities andor threats arising from changes in the market some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances customer requirements demographic trends regulatory developments or competitor action and model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from business decisions informed by models which can be exacerbated by errors in methodology design or the way they are used in the course of our regular risk management activities we use models to help quantify the risk we are taking we believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable within the parameters for which the models have been built and calibrated to operate but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models consequently actual results may differ significantly from model projections the severe projections of macroeconomic variables during the covid19 pandemic and subsequent significant recovery represent events outside the parameters for which the models have been built as a result adjustments to model outputs to reflect consideration of management judgment are used with stringent governance in place to ensure appropriate results where models do not require adjustments enhanced model monitoring confirms models are performing as intended see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of the objectives of our risk management system as well as our risk management policies and practices there have been no material changes to our approach to risk management since december credit risk management credit risk is managed through a robust risk identification and control framework which outlines clear and consistent policies principles and guidance for risk managers credit risk is monitored using various internal risk management measures and within limits approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities our credit risk management procedures are designed for all stages of economic and financial cycles including challenging periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty during the first quarter of in addition to the continued economic uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic the impact of the russiaukraine war created further uncertainty about the future economic environment while our credit risk exposure to russia was immaterial at march the impact of the war on

towards liquidity and funding risk management we employ the measures discussed below to define monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with hsbc policy as of january hsbc north america met the criteria to be reclassified as a category iv firm and as a result of this classification change hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa are subject to a further reduced us liquidity coverage ratio lcr and net stable funding ratio nsfr requirement of percent so long as hsbc north americas weighted shortterm wholesale funding equals or exceeds billion hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa elected to report subject to the reduced us lcr and nsfr requirement of percent beginning april whereas they were previously subject to the requirement of percent applicable under category

remained above the percent minimum requirement the uk pra based nsfr which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities took effect on january at both march and december hsbc usas nsfr exceeded percent the ratio at december was estimated based on our interpretation and understanding of the basel committee nsfr guidance at that time a nsfr of percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of funding for assets and offbalance sheet exposures hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa are also currently subject to the us nsfr rule under the tailoring rules an percent nsfr requirement applies to category iii firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding under billion and their depository institution subsidiaries as a result under the us nsfr rule a nsfr of percent or more reflects an

liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa have liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules and may need to make changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future rules our liquidity and funding risk management approach includes deposits supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans in addition regulations require banks to retain a portfolio of hqla as such we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities hsbc usa inc our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong

value of equity eve eve represents the present value of the banking book cash flows that could be provided to our equity holder under a managed runoff scenario an eve sensitivity represents the change in eve due to a defined movement in interest rates we manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of basis points to the market implied interest rates at both march and december our eve remained within risk limits for the up and down basis point interest rate shock scenarios net interest income simulation modeling techniques we utilize simulation modeling to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income these techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various scenarios such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by basis points as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by basis points over a twelve month period in the gradual scenarios percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter the following table reflects the impact on our projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques march december amount amount dollars are in millions estimated increase decrease in projected net interest income reflects projected rate movements on april and january respectively resulting from a gradual basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from a gradual basis point decrease in the yield curve other significant scenarios monitored reflects projected rate movements on april and january respectively resulting from an immediate basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from an immediate basis point decrease in the yield curve the projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality size and composition of the balance sheet therefore although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity actual results will differ from these estimates possibly by significant amounts market risk management exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios trading portfolios comprise positions arising from marketmaking and warehousing of clientderived positions nontrading portfolios comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities and financial investments classified as availableforsale and heldtomaturity hsbc usa inc we apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and nontrading portfolios our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimize return on risk

total in millions at march three months ended march average maximum minimum at december portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types it represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types for example foreign exchange interest rate and credit spread together in one portfolio it is measured as the difference between the sum of the var by individual risk type and the combined total var a negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification as the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures the total var is nonadditive across risk types due to diversification effects for presentation purposes portfolio diversification of the var for trading portfolios includes varbased risknotinvar backtesting we routinely validate the accuracy of our var models by backtesting them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes nonmodeled items such as fees commissions and revenues of intraday transactions from the actual reported profit and loss we would expect under stable market conditions to see two or three losses in excess of var at the percent confidence level over a oneyear period however in periods of unstable market conditions we could see an increase in the number of backtesting exceptions during the first quarter of we experienced no loss backtesting exceptions nontrading portfolios nontrading var predominantly relates to markets treasury and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value which includes availableforsale and heldtomaturity assets and associated hedges our
