this s with the united states securities and exchange commission sec in press releases or oral or written presentations by representatives of hsbc usa inc hsbc usa and together with its subsidiaries husi that are not statements of historical fact and may also constitute forwardlooking statements words such as may will should would could appears believe intends expects estimates targeted plans anticipates goal and similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements but should not be considered as the only means through which these statements may be made all discussions related to strategy including the matters discussed under the heading managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview business update and discussions of those matters elsewhere in this by their nature models are based on various assumptions and relationships we believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models in actual stressed market conditions these assumptions and relationships may no longer hold causing actual experience to differ significantly from the results predicted in the model consequently model results may be considered reasonable estimates with the understanding that actual results may differ significantly from model projections table end key developments in in we undertook a number of key initiatives to enhance our approach to the management of risk these included table start we continued to strengthen our approach to managing nonfinancial risk as set out in the operational risk management framework ormf the ormf sets out our approach to governance and risk appetite it enables a single view of nonfinancial risks that matter the most and associated controls this is overseen by the operational risk function headed by the us head of operational risk table endtable start we simplified our risk taxonomy through consolidating certain existing risks into broader categories these changes streamline risk reporting and promote common language in our risk management approach further simplification will continue during including the combining of our two key risk management frameworks table endtable start we formed a resilience risk subfunction to reflect the growing regulatory importance of operational resilience the leadership of the resilience risk function in the united states is the responsibility of the us head of resilience risk see below for further discussion of resilience risk table end our material risks the principal risks associated with our operations include the following table start credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract table endtable start capital and liquidity risk is the risk of having insufficient capital liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements including pension risk table end table start hsbc usa inc table end table start market risk is the risk that movements in market factors such as foreign exchange rates interest rates credit spreads equity prices and commodity prices will reduce our income or the value of our portfolios table endtable start resilience risk is the risk that we are unable to provide critical services to our customers affiliates and counterparties as a result of sustained and significant operational disruption table endtable start regulatory compliance risk is the risk that we fail to observe the letter and spirit of relevant laws codes rules regulations and standards of good market practice which as a consequence incur fines and penalties and suffer damage to our business table endtable start financial crime and fraud risk is the risk that we knowingly or unknowingly help parties to commit or to further potentially illegal activity including both internal and external fraud table endtable start strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify execute and react appropriately to opportunities andor threats arising from changes in the market some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances customer requirements demographic trends regulatory developments or competitor action table endtable start model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from business decisions informed by models which can be exacerbated by errors in methodology design or the way they are used table end credit risk management credit risk is managed through a robust risk identification and control framework which outlines clear and consistent policies principles and guidance for risk managers credit risk is monitored using various internal risk management measures and within limits approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities the principle objectives of credit risk management are to table start maintain a strong culture of responsible lending and robust risk policies and control frameworks table endtable start partner with and challenge our businesses in defining implementing and continually reevaluating our risk appetite under actual and scenario conditions and table endtable start ensure there is independent scrutiny of credit risks their cost and their mitigation table end credit risk arises from various on and offbalance sheet instruments and arrangements such as table start loan portfolios table endtable start investment portfolios table endtable start unfunded commitments such as letters of credit and lines of credit and unutilized credit card lines that customers can draw upon and table endtable start derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps which may represent an exposure to the counterparty to the contract table end while credit risk exists widely in our operations diversification among various commercial and consumer portfolios helps to lessen risk exposure daytoday management of credit and market risk is performed by the chief credit officerhead of wholesale credit and market risk north america and the hsbc north america rbwm chief risk officer who report directly to the cro and maintain independent risk functions the credit risk associated with wholesale commercial portfolios is managed by the chief credit officer while credit risk associated with retail consumer loan portfolios such as credit cards installment loans and residential mortgages is managed by the rbwm chief risk officer further discussion of credit risk including risk associated with crossborder exposures can be found under the credit quality caption in this mda our credit risk management procedures are designed for all stages of economic and financial cycles including challenging periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty the credit risk function continues to refine early warning indicators and reporting including stress testing scenarios on the basis of recent experience these risk management tools are embedded within our business planning process action has been taken where necessary to improve our resilience to risks associated with the current market conditions by selectively discontinuing business lines or products closely managing underwriting criteria and investing in improved fraud prevention technologies the responsibilities of the credit risk function include table start formulating credit risk policies our policies are designed to ensure that all of our various retail and wholesale business units operate within clear standards of acceptable credit risk our policies ensure that the hsbc standards are consistently implemented across all businesses and that all regulatory requirements are also considered credit policies are reviewed and approved annually at the rmm and the risk committee of the board of directors table endtable start approving new credit exposures and independently assessing large exposures annually credit approval authorities are delegated by the risk committee of the board of directors to the cro with the authority to subdelegate to the chief credit officer and rbwm chief risk officer the chief credit officer and rbwm chief risk officer in turn delegate limited credit authority to the various lending units however most wholesale credits are reviewed and approved centrally through a dedicated credit approval unit that reports directly to the chief credit officer in addition the chief credit officer coordinates the review of material credits with the hsbc group credit risk which subject to certain agreed table end table start hsbc usa inc table end upon limits will concur on material new and renewal transactions large retail credits are escalated to the rbwm chief risk officer for review and concurrence table start overseeing retail credit and collateral risk the rbwm chief risk officer manages the credit and collateral risk associated with retail portfolios and is supported by expertise from a dedicated advanced risk analytics unit collateral risk in retail arises when the underlying value of the property securing a retail loan loses value due to macroeconomic local or industry conditions this risk is actively managed through ongoing monitoring of hpis in areas where we have identified property values as declining maximum loan to values will be adjusted downward to compensate for this risk table endtable start maintaining and developing the governance and operation of the wholesale risk rating system a twodimensional credit risk rating system is utilized in order to categorize exposures meaningfully and enable focused management of the risks involved this ratings system is comprised of a category customer risk rating which considers the probability of default of an obligor and a separate assessment of a transactions potential loss given default each credit grade has a probability of default estimate rating methodologies are based upon a wide range of analytics and market databased tools which are core inputs to the assessment of counterparty risk although automated risk rating processes are increasingly used for larger facilities the ultimate responsibility for setting risk grades rests in each case with the final approving executive risk grades are reviewed frequently and amendments where necessary are implemented promptly table endtable start measuring portfolio credit risk we continue to advance the measurement of the risk in our credit portfolios using techniques such as stress testing in certain internal reporting efforts continue to refine both the inputs and assumptions used to increase the usefulness in the evaluation of large and small commercial and retail customer portfolio products and business unit return on risk table endtable start monitoring portfolio performance credit data warehouses have been implemented to centralize the reporting of credit risk support the analysis of risk and to calculate credit loss reserves this data warehouse also supports hsbcs wider effort to meet the requirements of basel iii and to generate credit reports for management and the board of directors table endtable start establishing counterparty and portfolio limits we monitor and limit our wholesale exposure to individual counterparties and to the combined exposure of related counterparties in addition selected industry portfolios such as real estate are subject to caps that are recommended by the chief credit officer and reviewed where appropriate by management committees and the board of directors retail establishes portfolio limits by product as well as limits on new products and higherrisk segments such as investment property high ltv mortgages and credit cards which are targeted beyond our historical customer base these limits are approved by the rbwm chief risk officer and monitored by a retail credit risk management committee counterparty credit exposure related to derivative activities is also managed under approved limits since the exposure related to derivatives is variable and uncertain internal risk management methodologies are used to calculate the percent worstcase potential future exposure for each customer these methodologies take into consideration among other factors crossproduct closeout netting collateral received from customers under collateral support annexes termination clauses and offsetting positions within the portfolio table endtable start managing problem loans special attention is paid to problem loans when appropriate our wholesale loan management unit and retail collection and recovery teams provide customers with intensive management and control support in order to help them avoid default wherever possible and maximize recoveries table endtable start establishing allowances for credit losses the chief credit officer and the rbwm chief risk officer share responsibility with the chief financial officer for establishing appropriate levels of allowances for credit losses inherent in various loan portfolios table end sustainability risk is a component of credit risk and represents the risk that financial services provided to customers indirectly result in unacceptable impacts on people or on the environment we measure sustainability risk by assessing the potential sustainability impacts of a customers activities and assigning a sustainability risk rating sustainability risk is monitored by the businesses and the credit approval unit as well as hsbc group sustainability risk sustainability risk managers in the wholesale credit risk function with input from hsbc group sustainability risk are responsible for advising our businesses on managing environmental and social risks the wholesale credit risk functions responsibilities in relation to sustainability risk include table start overseeing our sustainability risk standards our application of the equator principles and our sustainability policies covering agricultural commodities chemicals defense energy forestry mining and metals ramsar wetlands and unesco world heritage sites table endtable start undertaking an independent review of transactions including escalating transactions to hsbc group sustainability risk where sustainability risks are assessed to be high and approving transactions where sustainability risks are of a lower magnitude and table endtable start providing training and capacity building within our businesses to ensure sustainability risks are identified and mitigated consistently table end credit review is an independent and critical second lod function its mission is to identify and evaluate areas of credit risk within our business credit review will focus on the review and evaluation of wholesale and retail lending activities and will identify table start hsbc usa inc table end risks and provide an ongoing assessment as to the effectiveness of the risk management framework and the related portfolios credit review will independently assess the business units and risk management functions to ensure the portfolios are managed and operating in a manner that is consistent with hsbc group strategy risk appetite appropriate local and hsbc group credit policies and procedures and applicable regulatory requirements for example this includes the unilateral authority to independently assess and revise customer risk ratings facility grades and loss given default estimates to ensure its independent stature the credit review delegation of authority is endorsed by the risk committee of our board of directors which grants the head of credit review unhindered access to the risk committee and executive sessions at the discretion of the head of credit review accordingly our board of directors has oversight of the credit review annual and ongoing plan quarterly plan updates and results of reviews capital and liquidity risk management capital and liquidity risk arises from changes to the respective buffers and risk profiles driven by customer behavior and the external environment capital risk is the risk that we fail to meet our regulatory capital requirements capital risk arises from a deterioration in the capital base due to losses and increased risk profile from management activity or the external environment we aim to maintain a strong capital base to support the risks inherent in our business and invest in accordance with our strategy meeting regulatory capital requirements at all times see liquidity and capital resources in this mda for a full discussion of our approach to capital risk management including our capital ratios and regulatory capital requirements liquidity and funding risk is the risk that we do not have sufficient financial resources to meet our obligations as they fall due or that we can only do so at an excessive cost or that funding considered to be sustainable and therefore used to fund assets is not sustainable over time liquidity and funding risk arises from mismatches in the timing of cash flows or when illiquid asset positions cannot be funded at the expected terms and when required we continuously monitor the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our liquidity and funding framework to reflect market events and the evolving regulatory landscape and view as to best practices historically we have seen the greatest strain in the wholesale market as opposed to the retail market the latter being the market from which we source stable demand and time deposit accounts which are less sensitive to market events or changes in interest rates liquidity is managed to provide the ability to generate cash to meet lending deposit withdrawal and other commitments at a reasonable cost in a reasonable amount of time while maintaining routine operations and market confidence market funding is coordinated with other hsbc group entities as the markets increasingly view debt issuances from the separate companies within the context of our common parent company liquidity and funding risk management is performed at the hsbc north america hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa levels each entity is required to have sufficient liquidity for a crisis situation alco develops and implements policies and procedures to ensure that the minimum liquidity ratios and a strong overall liquidity position are maintained alco projects cash flow requirements and determines the level of liquid assets and available funding sources to have at our disposal with consideration given to anticipated deposit and balance sheet growth contingent liabilities and the ability to access wholesale funding markets in addition to base case projections multiple stress scenarios are generated to simulate crisis conditions including table start runoff of nonstable deposits table endtable start inability to renew maturing interbank funding table endtable start drawdowns of committed loan facilities table endtable start decreases in the market value of liquid securities table endtable start additional collateral requirements for derivative transactions under existing collateral support agreements table endtable start rating downgrades of hsbc usa or hsbc bank usa and table endtable start increased discount on security values for repos or disposals table end in addition alco monitors the overall mix of deposit and funding concentrations to avoid undue reliance on individual funding sources and large deposit relationships as part of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management we employ the measures discussed below to define monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with hsbc policy the basel committee based liquidity coverage ratio lcr is designed to be a shortterm liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets hqla to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next days at both december and hsbc usas lcr under the eu lcr rule exceeded percent a lcr of percent or higher reflects an unencumbered hqla balance that is equal to or exceeds liquidity needs for a calendar day liquidity stress scenario hqla consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa are also subject to the us lcr rule under the us rule us institutions including hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa are currently required to maintain a minimum lcr of percent and report lcr to us regulators on a daily basis during hsbc bank usas lcr under the us lcr rule remained above the percent minimum requirement table start hsbc usa inc table end the european calibration of the basel committee based nsfr which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities is still pending therefore our calculation of nsfr is based on our current interpretation and understanding of the basel committee nsfr guidance which may differ in future periods depending on completion of the european calibration and further implementation guidance from regulators at both december and hsbc usas estimated nsfr exceeded percent a nsfr of percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of funding for assets and offbalance sheet exposures in april us regulators issued for public comment a proposal to implement the nsfr in the united states applicable to certain large banking organizations including hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa at both december and hsbc bank usas estimated nsfr based on our current interpretation and understanding of the proposed us nsfr rule exceeded percent as discussed further in part regulation and competition regulatory capital and liquidity requirements in this form 10k the tailoring rules reduced the regulatory lcr requirement for hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa from to percent beginning january the tailoring rules also indicate that an percent nsfr would apply to hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa once the nsfr rule is finalized hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa maintain their liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa may need to make further changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future rules alco also maintains a liquidity management and contingency funding plan contingency funding plan which identifies certain potential early warning indicators of liquidity problems and actions that can be taken both initially and in the event of a liquidity crisis to minimize the longterm impact on our businesses and customer relationships the contingency funding plan is reviewed annually and approved by the risk committee of our board of directors we recognize a liquidity crisis can either be specific to us relating to our ability to meet our obligations in a timely manner or marketwide caused by a macro risk event in the broader financial system a range of indicators are monitored to attain an early warning of any liquidity issues these include widening of key spreads or indices used to track market volatility material reductions or extreme volatility in customer deposit balances increased utilization of credit lines widening of our own credit spreads and higher borrowing costs at the onset of a crisis liquidity needs would be satisfied primarily with unsecured wholesale market funding if the crisis escalates contingency funding needs will be satisfied primarily through sales of securities from the investment portfolio and secured borrowing using the mortgage portfolio as collateral securities may be sold or used as collateral in a repurchase agreement depending on the scenario portions of the mortgage portfolio may be used as collateral at the fhlb to increase borrowings we maintain a liquid asset buffer consisting of cash shortterm liquid assets and unencumbered government and other highly rated investment securities as a source of funding further collateral is maintained at the federal reserve bank discount window and the fhlb providing additional secured borrowing capacity in a liquidity crisis in addition to the oversight provided by alco liquidity risk management lrm is a second lod oversight function for liquidity which independently reports into the cro lrms primary mandate is to strengthen our liquidity and funding risk management framework through challenge and review of existing processes and recommending areas that need improvement to the rmm lrm serves as an advisory function to senior management to ensure front line units with direct responsibility for managing liquidity risk are operating within their operating guidelines and defined risk appetite parameters the lrm oversight mandate is carried out through critical evaluation and challenge of existing risk management processes including stress testing and ratio calculations our liquidity and funding risk management approach includes deposits supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans in addition current regulatory initiatives require banks to retain a portfolio of hqla as such we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong ratings from the major credit ratings agencies the following table reflects the short and longterm credit ratings of hsbc

table end table start hsbc usa inc table end rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends regulatory developments future profitability risk management practices and legal matters all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions during the fourth quarter of sp and moodys both changed their rating outlooks for hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa to negative from stable following similar changes in outlook to negative from stable for hsbc the outlook changes came after hsbc announced that it no longer expected to reach its return on tangible equity target and was planning potentially significant restructuring the negative outlooks reflect the implementation challenges of the planned restructuring in the context of a weakening external environment while the outlooks changed sp and moodys both affirmed their long and shortterm issuer credit ratings for hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa in addition during the fourth quarter of fitch downgraded the longterm debt ratings of both hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa by one notch to a and maintained a negative rating watch following a similar rating action for hsbc the rating downgrade reflects a downward revision by fitch of the hsbc groups business model execution and earnings viability scores which came after hsbc announced that it had lowered its return targets and was planning potentially significant restructuring as discussed above fitch believes this announcement highlights weakness in the stability of the hsbc groups business model and the earnings capacity of its geographic footprint as part of this review the shortterm ratings of both hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa were reaffirmed while these rating actions by sp moodys and fitch did not have a material impact on our borrowing costs or liquidity any future actions could have such an impact although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future at december there were no pending actions in terms of changes to ratings on the debt of hsbc usa or hsbc bank usa from any of the rating agencies numerous factors internal and external may impact access to and costs associated with issuing debt in the global capital markets these factors include our debt ratings overall economic conditions overall capital markets volatility and the effectiveness of the management of credit risks inherent in our customer base cash resources shortterm investments and a trading asset portfolio are available to provide highly liquid funding for us additional liquidity is provided by availableforsale and heldtomaturity debt securities approximately million of the debt securities in these portfolios at december are expected to mature in the remaining million of debt securities not expected to mature in are available to provide liquidity by serving as collateral for secured borrowings or if needed by being sold further liquidity is available through our ability to sell or securitize loans in secondary markets in we did not sell or securitize any residential mortgage loan portfolios other than the normal sales of agencyeligible mortgage loan originations it is the policy of hsbc bank usa to maintain both primary and secondary collateral in order to ensure precautionary borrowing availability from the federal reserve bank primary collateral is collateral that is physically maintained at the federal reserve bank and serves as a safety net against any unexpected funding shortfalls that may occur secondary collateral is collateral that is acceptable to the federal reserve bank but is not maintained there if unutilized borrowing capacity were to be low secondary collateral would be identified and maintained as necessary further liquidity is available from the fhlb see liquidity and capital resources in this mda for further discussion of our liquidity position including additional information regarding our outstanding borrowings the remaining availability of our debt issuance programs and our funding strategy pension risk is a component of capital and liquidity risk and represents the risk of increased costs from offering postemployment benefit plans to our employees certain employees are eligible to participate in the hsbc north america qualified defined benefit pension plan which has been frozen while plan assets were higher than projected plan liabilities resulting in an overfunded status of approximately million at december changes in market conditions could result in an underfunded status occurring in future periods because these obligations relate to the hsbc north america pension plan only a portion of any deficit could be considered our responsibility we and other hsbc north america affiliates with employees participating in this plan will be required to make up any shortfall over a number of years as specified under the pension protection act this can be accomplished through direct contributions appreciation in plan assets andor increases in interest rates resulting in lower liability valuations see note pension and other postretirement benefits in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the hsbc north america defined benefit plan market risk management exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios table start trading portfolios comprise positions arising from marketmaking and warehousing of clientderived positions table endtable start nontrading portfolios comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities and financial investments classified as availableforsale and heldtomaturity table end we apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and nontrading portfolios our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimize return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite table start hsbc usa inc table end the nature of the hedging and risk mitigation strategies performed corresponds to the market risk management instruments available these strategies range from the use of traditional market instruments such as interest rate swaps to more sophisticated hedging strategies to address a combination of risk factors arising at the portfolio level market risk governance market risk is managed and controlled through limits approved by the risk committee of the board of directors and the rmm as well as the various businesses and also ratified by the hsbc group risk management meeting these limits are allocated across business lines and to the hsbc group legal entities including hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa we have an independent market risk management and control function in north america which is responsible for setting the risk appetite measuring market risk exposures in accordance with the policies defined by hsbc group risk and monitoring and reporting these exposures against the prescribed limits on a daily basis model risk is governed through model oversight committees at the regional and global wholesale credit and market risk levels the committees have direct oversight and approval responsibility for all traded risk models utilized for risk measurement and management and stress testing they prioritize the development of models methodologies and practices used for traded risk management and ensure that they remain within our risk appetite and business plans we are committed to the ongoing development and enhancement of our inhouse risk models subject to regulatory approval refer to model risk management below for further discussion regarding the management and monitoring of model risk across north america our control of market risk in the trading and nontrading portfolios is based on a policy of restricting operations to trading within a list of permissible instruments ultimately approved by hsbc group risk as well as enforcing new product approval procedures through a dedicated committee market risk measures we use a range of tools to monitor and limit market risk exposures including sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis measures the impact of individual market factor movements on specific instruments or portfolios for example the impact of a one basis point change in the yield curve we use sensitivity analysis to monitor the market risk positions within each risk type sensitivity limits are set for portfolios products and risk types with the depth of the market being one of the principal factors in determining the level of limits set value at risk var var is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence the use of var is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalize them in addition we calculate var for nontrading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk where we do not calculate var explicitly we use alternative tools as summarized in the stress testing section below our var models are predominantly based on historical simulation which incorporates the following features table start historical market rates and prices are calculated with reference to foreign exchange rates commodity prices interest rates and the associated volatilities table endtable start potential market movements utilized for var are calculated with reference to data from the past two years table endtable start scenario profit and losses are calculated utilizing the market scenarios for all relevant risk factors and table endtable start var measures are calculated to a percent confidence level and use a oneday holding period table end the models also incorporate the effect of option features on the underlying exposures the nature of the var models means that an increase in observed market volatility will lead to an increase in var without any changes in the underlying positions although a valuable guide to risk var should always be viewed in the context of its limitations for example table start the use of historical data as a proxy for estimating future events may not encompass all potential events particularly those which are extreme in nature table endtable start the use of a holding period assumes that all positions can be liquidated or the risks offset during that period which may not fully reflect the market risk arising at times of severe illiquidity when the holding period may be insufficient to liquidate or hedge all positions fully table endtable start the use of a percent confidence level does not take into account losses that might occur beyond this level of confidence and table endtable start var is calculated on the basis of exposures outstanding at the close of business and therefore does not necessarily reflect intraday exposures table end the risks not in var rniv framework aims to capture and capitalize material market risks that are not adequately covered in the var model risk factors are reviewed on a regular basis and either incorporated directly in the var models where possible or quantified through the rniv rniv stresses interest rate basis risk exposure and interest rate volatility skewness rniv riskweighted assets make up approximately percent of husi market risk riskweighted assets though contribution to total husi riskweighted assets remains immaterial table start hsbc usa inc table end stressed var stressed var is primarily used for regulatory capital purposes and is integrated into the risk management process to facilitate efficient capital management stressed var complements other risk measures by providing severe potential losses associated with stressed market conditions stressed var modeling follows the same approach as var except stressed var calculates potential loss at a percent confidence level for a oneday holding period based on a one year historical period that is calibrated to the most volatile period for the trading portfolio stress testing stress testing is an important procedure that is integrated into our market risk management framework to evaluate the potential impact on portfolio values of more extreme although plausible events or movements in a set of financial variables in such scenarios losses can be much greater than those predicted by var modeling a set of scenarios is used consistently across the hsbc group scenarios are tailored to capture the relevant potential events or market movements at each level the risk appetite around potential stress losses is set and monitored against corresponding limits the process is governed by the stress testing review group forum which in conjunction with regional risk management determines the scenarios to be applied main scenario types are as follows table start single risk factor stress scenarios that are unlikely to be captured within the var models such as the break of a currency peg table endtable start technical scenarios that incorporate the largest move in each risk factor independent from any underlying market correlation table endtable start hypothetical scenarios are mainly built on potential macroeconomic events for example the slowdown in mainland china and the potential effects of a sovereign debt default including its wider contagion effects curves steepening or flattening scenarios and table endtable start historical scenarios which incorporate past observations of market movements during periods of stress which are not captured within var table end market risk reverse stress tests are undertaken on the premise that there is a fixed loss the stress testing process identifies which scenarios lead to this loss the rationale behind the reverse stress test is to understand scenarios which are beyond normal business conditions and could have contagion and systemic implications stressed var and stress testing together with reverse stress testing provide management with insights regarding the tail risk beyond var for which our appetite is limited market risk in the global market environment was characterized by slowing global economic conditions trade tensions between the united states and china and other geopolitical events global economic growth slowed as trade tensions between the united states and china impacted global trade growth and eroded further confidence in the global economy the frb took a policy easing stance in as they cut interest rates three times during the year in midseptember a sudden spike in short term repurchase agreement funding rates resulted in frb intervention via the establishment of overnight and term repurchase agreement facilities and us treasury buybacks in we observed material volatility in latin america driven by changes in the political establishment and social unrest these geopolitical events eroded investor confidence and led to a reduction in client risk appetite in those regions however in the fourth quarter of the announcement of a trade deal between the united states and china drove overall riskon sentiment by investors for developed markets further in latin america we observed easing of social unrest close to yearend which reduced local market volatility ongoing strength regarding the us labor market and low unemployment remained through the year and the sp index hit a record high to close out a focus on global economic indicators with a backdrop of political uncertainty as the united states enters a presidential election year will be a significant theme in trading portfolios trading var generates from the global markets unit of the gbm business segment portfolios are mainly comprised of foreign exchange products interest rate swaps credit default swaps and precious metals ie gold silver platinum in both north america and emerging markets trading var at december was relatively flat as compared with december as the global markets business in the united states continued to focus on customer facilitation and interest rate derivative markets interest rate risk is the main driver of exposure table start hsbc usa inc table end the following graph summarizes daily var for our trading portfolios at a percent confidence level in millions the following table summarizes our trading var for and table start foreign exchange and commodity interest rate credit spread portfolio diversification total in millions at december full year average maximum minimum at december full year average maximum minimum table end table start table end table start portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types it represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types for example foreign exchange interest rate and credit spread together in one portfolio it is measured as the difference between the sum of the var by individual risk type and the combined total var a negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification as the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures table endtable start the total var is nonadditive across risk types due to diversification effects for presentation purposes portfolio diversification of the var for trading portfolios includes varbased risknotinvar table end backtesting we routinely validate the accuracy of our var models by backtesting them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes nonmodeled items such as fees commissions and revenues of intraday transactions from the actual reported profit and loss we would expect on average to see two or three profits and two or three losses in excess of var at the percent confidence level over a oneyear period the actual number of profits or losses in excess of var over this period can therefore be used to gauge how well the models are performing to ensure a conservative approach to calculating our risk exposures it is important to note that profits in excess of var are only considered when backtesting the accuracy of models and are not used for capital purposes in we experienced three profit and two loss backtesting exceptions a profit exception in march and a loss exception in april were mainly driven by precious metal future and spot price movements a loss exception in june was primarily driven by market volatility in emerging market currencies and rates a profit exception in july was driven by a large drop in market yields outside of historical distribution and a profit exception in august was driven by argentina market volatility nontrading portfolios nontrading var predominantly relates to balance sheet management and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value which includes availableforsale and heldtomaturity assets and associated hedges our investment portfolio holdings are mainly comprised of us treasury us government agency mortgagebacked and us government sponsored mortgagebacked securities our nontrading var exposure is driven by interest rates and agency spread volatility nontrading var was higher at december as compared with december due primarily to increased volatility in the historical var time series investment portfolio overall size and asset allocation were stable during the year table start hsbc usa inc table end the following table summarizes our nontrading var for and table start interest rate credit spread portfolio diversification total in millions at december full year average maximum minimum at december full year average maximum minimum table end table start table end table start refer to the trading var table above for additional information table end nontrading var also includes the interest rate risk of nontrading financial assets and liabilities held by the global businesses and transfer priced into balance sheet management which has the mandate to centrally manage and hedge it interest rate swaps used by balance sheet management bsm to hedge the interest rate risk of the investment portfolio and transfer price risk from the banking book are typically classified as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge and included within our nontraded var in case there is residual market risk that cannot be efficiently and conveniently hedged by bsm they are managed by alco in segregated alco books see below for a broader discussion on how interest rate risk is managed stressed var the following table reflects stressed var at december and table start at december in millions stressed var 1day equivalent table end stressed var at december was lower as compared with december driven by a reduction of inventory in rates and foreign exchange products as well as the impact of lower market rates during the stressed period interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income due to mismatched pricing between assets and liabilities as well as losses in value due to interest rate movements we are subject to interest rate risk associated with the repricing characteristics of our balance sheet assets and liabilities specifically as interest rates change amounts of interest earning assets and liabilities fluctuate and interest earning assets reprice at intervals that do not correspond to the maturities or repricing patterns of interest bearing liabilities this mismatch between assets and liabilities in repricing sensitivity results in changes to projected net interest income as interest rates move to help manage the risks associated with changes in interest rates and to manage net interest income within interest rate risk ranges management considers acceptable we use derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps options futures and forwards as hedges to modify the repricing characteristics of specific assets liabilities forecasted transactions or firm commitments analysis of this risk is complicated by having to make assumptions on embedded optionality within certain product areas such as the incidence of mortgage prepayments and from behavioral assumptions regarding the economic duration of liabilities which are contractually repayable on demand such as current accounts these assumptions around behavioral features are captured in our interest rate behavioralization framework which is described further below daytoday management of interest rate risk is centralized principally in bsm we have significant but historically well controlled interest rate risk in large part due to our portfolio of residential mortgages and mortgage backed securities which consumers can prepay without penalty and our large base of demand and savings deposits these deposits can be withdrawn by consumers at will but historically they have been a stable source of relatively low cost funds in addition we have a considerable number of contracts referencing libor the process of adopting new reference rates may expose us to an increased level of financial risks such as potential earnings volatility see executive overview in this mda for a full discussion of our libor transition in the course of managing interest rate risk an economic value of equity eve analysis is utilized in conjunction with a combination of other risk assessment techniques to identify and assess the potential impact of interest rate movements and take table start hsbc usa inc table end appropriate action this combination of techniques with some focusing on the impact of interest rate movements on the valuation of the balance sheet eg eve present value of a basis point pvbp repricing gap analysis var and others focusing on the impact of interest rate movements on earnings eg net interest income simulation modeling basis risk analysis allows for comprehensive analyses from different perspectives during we began managing our net interest rate risk sensitivities to a static balance sheet as a result we have revised prior year amounts in the net interest income simulation modeling table below in order to conform to the current year presentation a key element of managing interest rate risk is the management of the convexity of the balance sheet largely resulting from the mortgage related products on the balance sheet convexity risk arises as mortgage loan consumers change their payment behavior significantly in response to large movements in market rates but do not change behavior appreciably for smaller changes in market rates certain interest rate management tools such as eve and net interest income simulation modeling described below better capture the embedded convexity in the balance sheet while measures such as pvbp are designed to capture the risk of smaller changes in rates the assessment techniques discussed below act as a guide for managing interest rate risk associated with balance sheet composition and offbalance sheet hedging strategy the risk position calculated values within limit ranges reflect an acceptable risk position although possible future unfavorable trends may prompt adjustments to on or offbalance sheet exposure calculated values outside of limit ranges will result in consideration of adjustment of the risk position or consideration of temporary dispensation from making adjustments economic value of equity eve eve represents the present value of the banking book cash flows that could be provided to our equity holder under a managed runoff scenario an eve sensitivity represents the change in eve due to a defined movement in interest rates we manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of basis points to the market implied interest rates at both december and our eve remained within risk appetite for the up and down basis point interest rate shock scenarios repricing gap analysis the following table shows the repricing structure of our assets and liabilities at december for assets and liabilities whose cash flows are subject to change due to movements in interest rates such as the sensitivity of mortgage loans to prepayments data is reported based on the earlier of expected repricing or maturity and reflects anticipated prepayments based on the current rate environment the resulting gaps are reviewed to assess the potential sensitivity to earnings with respect to the direction magnitude and timing of changes in market interest rates data shown is as of yearend and oneday figures can be distorted by temporary swings in assets or liabilities the repricing structure of our assets and liabilities may be impacted by the implementation of our business strategy which is described under the heading executive overview

includes loans held for sale table end table start hsbc usa inc table end various techniques are utilized to quantify and monitor risks associated with the repricing characteristics of our assets liabilities and derivative contracts net interest income simulation modeling techniques we utilize simulation modeling to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income these techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various scenarios such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by basis points as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by basis points over a twelve month period in the gradual scenarios percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter the following table reflects the impact on our projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques table start december december amount amount dollars are in

point increase in the yield curve resulting from an immediate basis point decrease in the yield curve table end projected net interest income sensitivity figures represent the effect of movements in net interest income based on the projected yield curve scenarios and our current interest rate risk profile this effect however does not incorporate actions which would probably be taken by bsm or in the businesses to mitigate the effect of interest rate risk in reality bsm seeks proactively to change the interest rate risk profile to minimize losses and optimize net revenues the net interest income simulation modeling calculations assume that interest rates of all maturities move by the same amount in the upshock scenario rates are not assumed to become negative in the downshock scenario which may effectively result in nonparallel shock in addition the net interest income simulation modeling calculations take account of the effect on net interest income of anticipated differences in changes between interbank interest rates and interest rates over which the entity has discretion in terms of the timing and extent of rate changes the projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality size and composition of the balance sheet therefore although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity actual results will differ from these estimates possibly by significant amounts interest rate risk behavioralization unlike liquidity risk which is assessed on the basis of a very severe stress scenario interest rate risk is assessed and managed according to businessasusual conditions in many cases the contractual profile of our assets and liabilities does not reflect the behavior observed behavioralization is therefore used to assess the interest rate risk of our assets and liabilities and this assessed risk is transferred to bsm in accordance with the rules governing the transfer of interest rate risk from the global businesses to bsm behavioralization is applied in three key areas table start the assessed repricing frequency of managed rate balances table endtable start the assessed duration of noninterest bearing balances typically capital and current accounts and table endtable start the base case expected prepayment behavior or pipeline takeup rate
