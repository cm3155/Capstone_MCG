hsbc husi may also be referred to in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda as we us or our economic environment the us economy continued to grow during the first quarter of despite continued pressures from inflation and elevated interest rates which are expected to lead to a slowdown of future economic growth us gross domestic product gdp grew at an estimated annual rate of percent in the first quarter of while the personal consumption expenditures price index of percent in march remained slightly above the frbs target inflation rate in march the frb decided to hold shortterm interest rates steady and while interest rates are expected to remain elevated for some time the frb is expected to start decreasing shortterm interest rates in the timing of which is dependent upon future economic conditions although the us economy continued to grow during the first quarter of economic uncertainty remains due to elevated interest rates inflation levels and the expectation for slowing economic growth all of which will continue to impact our business in future periods concerns over domestic and global policy issues trade policy in the us and geopolitical events including the turmoil in the middle east as well as the implications of those events on the markets in general further add to the global uncertainty interest rate levels inflation and economic growth in combination with global economic conditions fiscal and monetary policy and the level of regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in and beyond performance developments and trends as previously disclosed in november the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic issued a final rule that imposes a special assessment on certain fdicinsured banks including hsbc bank usa to recover the loss to the deposit insurance fund dif arising from the protection of uninsured depositors following a determination of systemic risk in connection with the failures of silicon valley bank and signature bank this resulted in additional deposit insurance assessment fees of million being accrued in because the estimated loss to the dif will be periodically adjusted as actual losses are incurred the fdic retains the ability to cease collection early extend the special assessment collection period beyond the initial eightquarter collection period or impose a final shortfall special assessment after the receiverships for the two banks are terminated during the first quarter of we became aware that the estimated loss to the dif has increased and as a result we accrued million of additional deposit insurance assessment fees to reflect our best estimate of the updated special assessment amount the fdic is expected to inform banks who are required to fund the shortfall in the dif of the amount of the updated special assessment in june the following tables set forth selected financial metrics of husi for

losses as a percentage of total deposits net income was million during the three months ended march compared with million during the three months ended march income before income tax was million during the three months ended march compared with million during the three months ended march the decrease in income before income tax during the three months ended march was due to lower net interest income as interest expense on deposits and interest bearing liabilities grew faster than interest income on interest earning assets as well as higher operating expenses driven by the additional deposit insurance special assessment fees which were accrued in the first quarter of as discussed above these decreases were largely offset by higher other revenues driven by higher trading revenue and a lower provision for credit losses see results of operations for a more detailed discussion of our operating trends in addition see balance sheet review for further discussion on our asset and liability trends liquidity and capital resources for further discussion on funding and capital and credit quality for additional discussion on our credit trends in march the sec adopted final rules that will require registrants to disclose climaterelated information in registration statements and annual reports including material climaterelated risks descriptions of board oversight and risk management activities the material impacts of these risks on a registrants strategy business model and outlook and any material climaterelated targets or goals nonaccelerated filers such as hsbc usa will be exempt from the requirements to disclose scope and scope emissions registrants will also have to disclose among other things certain effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions eg hurricanes tornadoes flooding relating to capitalized costs and charges expenditures and losses in their audited financial statements hsbc usa will be required to comply with the rules for fiscal years beginning january with certain additional disclosure requirements becoming applicable for fiscal years beginning january following adoption of the rules several lawsuits were filed challenging them and subsequently consolidated into the eighth circuit court of appeals the sec issued an order in april to stay the rules pending the judicial review by the eighth circuit of the consolidated challenges hsbc usa inc basis of reporting our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap group reporting basis we report financial information to hsbc in accordance with hsbc group accounting and reporting policies which apply international financial reporting standards ifrss as issued by the iasb as a result our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of hsbc groups accounting and reporting policies group reporting basis because operating results on the group reporting basis are used in managing our businesses and rewarding performance of employees our management also separately monitors profit before tax under this basis of reporting the following table reconciles our us gaap versus group reporting basis profit before tax three months ended march in millions profit before tax us gaap basis adjustments expected credit losses renewable energy tax credit investments other longlived assets other profit before tax group reporting basis the significant differences between us gaap and the group reporting basis as they impact our results are summarized in note business segments in our form 10k there have been no significant changes since december in the differences between us gaap and the group reporting basis impacting our results differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for the periods presented are explained below during the first quarter of expected credit losses were higher under us gaap than under the group reporting basis under the group reporting basis a majority of our loans are considered to be in stage which requires a 12month expected credit losses ecl estimate while under us gaap such loans require a lifetime ecl estimate primarily as a result of the different requirements loss provisions associated with growth in innovation banking were more pronounced under us gaap during the first quarter of expected credit losses were lower under us gaap than under the group reporting basis primarily as a result of the different requirements related to stage loans discussed above the favorable impact of improved housing price forecasts on residential mortgages was more pronounced under us gaap during the first quarter of other longlived assets in the table above reflects million of lease related impairment charges under us gaap associated with the exit of certain office space while under the group reporting basis impairment was recognized when we committed to vacate the space in the fourth quarter of in addition amortization expense for longlived assets was higher under us gaap due primarily to the impact of an impairment charge recorded under the group reporting basis in related to the writeoff of all the capitalized software and a portion of the leasehold improvements associated with our wealth and personal banking business segment while under us gaap no impairment charge was required subsequent to recognition of the impairment charge in expenditures for software development and newly completed leasehold improvements in our wealth and personal banking business segment were capitalized and amortized over their useful lives under us gaap but not under the group reporting basis consequently the carrying amounts of capitalized software and leasehold improvements were higher under us gaap than under the group reporting basis and as a result corresponding amortization expense was higher under us gaap as previously disclosed during the second quarter of we determined that the cash generating unit was no longer impaired under the group reporting basis and that its estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value which resulted in the reestablishment of these assets at their recoverable amount net of amortization that would have been recorded had no impairment loss been recognized and excluding any assets that had since been sold hsbc usa inc balance sheet review the following table provides balance sheet totals at march and increases decreases since december increase decrease

mda for a discussion of trends in our allowance for credit losses on loans commercial loans increased compared with december driven by higher loans to affiliates partially offset by paydowns and maturities exceeding new business activity as we continued to apply a disciplined lending approach the decline in commercial nonaffiliate loans was primarily in the diversified financials consumer services banking and technology industries partially offset by increases in the utilities and real estate industries consumer loans increased compared with december due to continued growth in

updated by the change in the federal housing finance agencys house price index hpi at either a corebased statistical area or state level the estimated value of the homes could differ from actual fair values due to changes in condition of the underlying property variations in housing price changes within metropolitan statistical areas and other factors as a result actual property values associated with loans that end in foreclosure may be significantly lower than the estimates used for purposes of this disclosure current estimated property values are calculated using the most current hpis available and applied on an individual loan basis which results in an approximate three month delay in the production of reportable statistics therefore the information in the table above reflects

primarily in deposits and shortterm borrowings partially offset by higher interest income from interest earning assets driven by higher yields and higher average balances in securities and trading

net interest income of each segment represents the difference between actual interest earned on assets and interest incurred on liabilities of the segment adjusted for a funding charge or credit that includes both interest rate and liquidity components segments are charged a cost to fund assets eg customer loans and receive a funding credit for funds provided eg customer deposits based on equivalent market rates that incorporate both repricing interest rate risk and tenor liquidity characteristics the objective of these chargescredits is to transfer interest rate risk to one centralized unit in markets treasury markets treasury income statement and balance sheet results are allocated to each of the global businesses based upon tangible equity levels and levels of any surplus liabilities certain other revenue and operating expense amounts are also apportioned among the business segments based upon the benefits derived from this activity or the relationship of this activity to other segment activity these intersegment transactions have not been eliminated and we generally account for them as if they were with third parties we report financial information to our parent hsbc in accordance with hsbc group accounting and reporting policies which apply ifrss as issued by the iasb as a result our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the group reporting basis as operating results are monitored and reviewed trends are evaluated and decisions about allocating resources such as employees are primarily made on this basis we continue however to monitor capital adequacy and report to regulatory agencies on a us gaap basis during the second quarter of we implemented a change to our internal management

management fees driven by higher average assets under management and lower liquidity fee waivers reflecting the impact of higher market interest rates as well as the improved performance of economic hedge positions used to manage interest rate risk expected credit losses decreased during the three months ended march due to a loss provision in the prior year period driven by a higher loss estimate

replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered counterparties to our derivative activities include financial institutions central clearing parties foreign and domestic government agencies corporations funds mutual funds hedge funds etc insurance companies and private clients as well as other hsbc entities these counterparties are subject to regular credit review by the credit risk management department to minimize credit risk we may enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events in addition we reduce credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties the determination of the need for and the levels of collateral will differ based on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty andor regulatory requirements the total risk in a derivative contract is a function of a number of variables such as volatility of interest rates currencies equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments current market events or trends country risk maturity and liquidity of contracts creditworthiness of the counterparties in the transaction the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties and existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures the table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the general riskbased capital rules of the basel iii standardized approach which includes the net positive marktomarket of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount the regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and therefore allow for reductions of riskweighted assets when netting requirements have been met and collateral exists as a result riskweighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures furthermore many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral in addition many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date as a result these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital rules march december in

have the right to change terms or conditions for cause upon notification to the customer for a summary of guarantees including standby letters of credit and certain credit derivative transactions as well as the contractual amounts outstanding at march and december see note guarantee arrangements pledged asset and repurchase agreements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default as a result we believe that the contractual amount is not representative of the actual future credit exposure or funding requirements hsbc usa inc in addition we had commitments to purchase securities under agreements to resell on a forward starting basis totaling billion and billion at march and december respectively these contracts typically expire in less than one month and are secured by collateral primarily from us treasury securities our offbalance sheet arrangements also include transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities vies see note variable interest entities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of these unconsolidated vies fair value fair value hierarchy fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability the fair value framework the fair value framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants assumptions it emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs for financial instruments carried at fair value the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market level where the market for a financial instrument is not active valuation techniques are used the majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument level because level and level instruments are determined by observable inputs less judgment is applied in determining their fair values in the absence of observable market inputs the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs level the determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve we consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price the level of bidask spreads a lack of pricing transparency due to among other things complexity of the product and market liquidity whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data and whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities a financial instrument is classified as a level measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the overthecounter otc market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume we regard financial instruments such as debt securities equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded nonexchangetraded instruments classified as level assets include securities issued by the us treasury tobeannounced securities noncallable securities issued by us government sponsored enterprises and certain foreign governmentbacked debt level inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as level inputs we classify mortgage passthrough securities agency and certain nonagency mortgage collateralized obligations nonexchangetraded derivative contracts assetbacked securities obligations of us states and political subdivisions corporate debt securities certain foreign governmentbacked debt preferred securities securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements precious metals certain loans held for sale certain student loans held for investment residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral real estate owned and certain client share repurchase transactions as level measurements where possible at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments we have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the thirdparty pricing services to ensure that pricing information meets the fair value objective and where appropriate this pricing data is backtested to market trade executions where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value we investigate and reconcile the differences if the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value the instrument will be classified as level within the fair value hierarchy in general we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a nonderivative instrument level derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity the fair value of certain derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable indices traded in the otc market appropriate control processes and hsbc usa inc procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors level inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability that is level inputs incorporate market participants assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk we develop level inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances at march and december our level assets and liabilities measured at fair value included the following certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded derivatives have significant unobservable inputs eg volatility or default correlations certain assetbacked securities individually assessed commercial loans mortgage servicing rights derivatives with certain inputs which are unobservable certain credit default swaps certain loans held for sale and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of visa class b shares for which the fair value is dependent upon the final resolution of the related litigation see note fair value measurements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on level inputs level measurements the following table provides information about level assetsliabilities in relation to total assetsliabilities measured at fair value at march and december march december  are in millions level assets total assets measured at fair value level liabilities total liabilities measured at fair value level assets as a percent of total assets measured at fair value level liabilities as a percent of total liabilities measured at fair value presented without netting which allows the offsetting of amounts relating to certain contracts if certain conditions are met includes million of recurring level assets and million of nonrecurring level assets at march includes million of recurring level assets and million of nonrecurring level assets at december includes million of assets measured on a recurring basis and million of assets measured on a nonrecurring basis at march includes million of assets measured on a recurring basis and million of assets measured on a nonrecurring basis at december significant changes in fair value for level assets and liabilities see note fair value measurements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into out of level measurements during the three months ended march and as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value effect of changes in significant unobservable inputs the fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by derived from or corroborated by observable market data the resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value measurements of these financial instruments for the purpose of preparing the financial statements the final valuation inputs selected are based on managements best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities the unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures when we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately million or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement of approximately million at march the effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of certain creditlinked structured notes and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of visa class b shares risk management overview the primary role of risk management is to protect our customers business colleagues and the communities that we serve while ensuring we are able to support our strategy and provide sustainable growth we aim to use a comprehensive risk management approach across the organization and across all risk types underpinned by our culture and values this is outlined in our risk management framework including the key principles and practices that we employ in managing material risks both financial and nonfinancial this framework fosters continuous monitoring promotes hsbc usa inc risk awareness and encourages sound operational and strategic decisionmaking and escalation processes it also supports a consistent approach to identifying assessing managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities with clear accountabilities our board of directors has the ultimate responsibility for the effective oversight of risk management and approves our risk appetite it is advised on risk matters by the risk committee of the board of directors notably risk appetite and its alignment with our strategy risk governance and internal controls as well as highlevel risk related matters we use a defined executive risk governance structure to help ensure there is appropriate oversight and accountability embedded throughout our business for the effective management of risk our material risks the principal risks associated with our operations include the following credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract treasury risk is the risk of having insufficient capital liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements including the risk of an adverse impact on earnings or capital due to changes in market interest rates together with pension risk market risk is the risk of an adverse financial impact on trading activities arising from changes in market parameters such as interest rates foreign exchange rates asset prices volatilities correlations and credit spreads climate risk relates to the financial and nonfinancial impacts that may arise as a consequence of climate change and the move to a net zero economy resilience risk is the risk of sustained and significant business disruption from execution delivery physical security or safety events causing the inability to provide critical services to our customers affiliates and counterparties regulatory compliance risk is the risk associated with breaching our duty to clients and other counterparties inappropriate market conduct and breaching related financial services regulatory standards financial crime risk is the risk that our products and services will be exploited for criminal activity including fraud bribery and corruption tax evasion sanctions and export control violations money laundering terrorist financing and proliferation financing strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify execute and react appropriately to opportunities andor threats arising from changes in the market some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances customer requirements demographic trends regulatory developments or competitor action and model risk is the risk of inappropriate or incorrect business decisions arising from the use of models that have been inadequately designed implemented or used or from models that do not perform in line with expectations and predictions in the course of our regular risk management activities we use models to help quantify the risk we are taking we believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable within the parameters for which the models have been built and calibrated to operate but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models adjustments to model outputs to reflect consideration of management judgment are used with stringent governance in place to ensure appropriate results models are also monitored to confirm they are performing as intended see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of the objectives of our risk management system as well as our risk management policies and practices other than the change to treasury risk management discussed below there have been no material changes to our approach to risk management since december credit risk management credit risk is managed through a robust risk identification and control framework which outlines clear and consistent policies principles and guidance for risk managers credit risk is monitored using various internal risk management measures and within limits approved by individuals within a framework of delegated authorities our credit risk management procedures are designed for all stages of economic and financial cycles including challenging periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty during the first quarter of economic uncertainty remained due to elevated interest rates inflation levels and the expectation for slowing economic growth we continue to monitor the performance of our material commercial loans as conditions evolve and take necessary credit actions where warranted see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of our approach to credit risk treasury risk management we continuously monitor our capital ratios and the impact of market events on our liquidity positions and will continue to adapt our frameworks as necessary to reflect market events and the evolving regulatory landscape and view as to best practices in the first quarter of we began managing our nontrading value at risk var exposure to a 10day holding period as compared with the previous approach which was based on a oneday holding period as a result we have revised prior year amounts in the nontrading var table below in order to conform to the current year presentation there hsbc usa inc have

and funding risk as part of our approach towards liquidity and funding risk management we employ the measures discussed below to define monitor and control our liquidity and funding risk in accordance with hsbc policy hsbc north america is subject to the us liquidity coverage ratio lcr rule which is designed to be a shortterm liquidity measure to ensure banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets hqla to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next days and both hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa calculate and report their lcr to us regulators on a daily basis during the three months ended march hsbc bank usas lcr remained above percent under the tailoring rules a percent lcr requirement applies to category iv firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding that equals or exceeds billion as a result a lcr of percent or higher reflects an unencumbered hqla balance that is equal to or exceeds percent of a category iv firms liquidity needs for a calendar day liquidity stress scenario hqla consists of cash or assets that can be converted into cash at little or no loss of value in private markets hsbc north america is also subject to the us net stable funding ratio nsfr rule which is a longer term liquidity measure with a 12month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities and both hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa calculate and report their nsfr to us regulators at both march and december hsbc bank usas nsfr exceeded percent under the tailoring rules a percent nsfr requirement applies to category iv firms with weighted shortterm wholesale funding that equals or exceeds billion as a result a nsfr of percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next months that is equal to or exceeds percent of a category iv firms required amount of funding for assets and offbalance sheet exposures in addition under the united kingdom uk prudential regulatory authority pra based nsfr rule hsbc usas nsfr exceeded percent at both march and december under the uk pra nsfr rule a nsfr of percent or more reflects an available stable funding balance from liabilities and capital over the next months that is equal to or exceeds the required amount of funding for assets and offbalance sheet exposures as a category iv firm hsbc north america is subject to liquidity stress testing and related liquidity buffer and liquidity risk management requirements hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa have liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules and may need to make changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future rules our liquidity and funding risk management approach includes deposits supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans in addition regulations require banks to retain a portfolio of hqla as such we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong

value of equity eve eve represents the present value of the banking book cash flows that could be provided to our equity holder under a managed runoff scenario an eve sensitivity represents the change

interest rates at both march and december our eve remained within risk limits for the up and down basis point interest rate shock scenarios earningsatrisk earningsatrisk is a measure of interest rate risk in the banking book generated by our nontrading assets and liabilities that primarily includes loans deposits with banks investment securities deposits longterm debt and any associated interest rate hedges that are not held for trading intent or in order to hedge positions held with trading intent earningsatrisk utilizes a number of interest rate scenarios to estimate the impact on projected banking book net interest income over a twelve month period such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by basis points as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by basis points in the gradual scenarios percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter the following table reflects the estimated impact of the earningsatrisk scenarios on projected banking book net interest income march december amount amount dollars are in millions estimated increase decrease in projected banking book net interest income reflects projected rate movements on april and january respectively resulting from a gradual basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from a gradual basis point decrease in the yield curve other significant scenarios monitored reflects projected rate movements on april and january respectively resulting from an immediate basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from an immediate basis point decrease in the yield curve the projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality size and composition of the balance sheet therefore although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity actual results will differ from these estimates possibly by significant amounts nontrading var nontrading var predominantly relates to markets treasury and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value which includes availableforsale and

hedge it hsbc usa inc market risk management exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios trading portfolios comprise positions held for client servicing and marketmaking with the intention of shortterm resale andor to hedge risks resulting from such positions nontrading portfolios comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities as well as financial investments classified as availableforsale and heldtomaturity we apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and nontrading portfolios our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimize return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of our approach to market risk value at risk var var is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence the use of var is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalize them in addition we calculate var for nontrading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk var measures are calculated to a percent confidence level and use a oneday holding period for trading var and a 10day holding period for nontrading var trading var trading var is generated principally from trading activities within the mss segment of

diversification total in millions at march three months ended march average maximum minimum at december portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types it represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types for example foreign exchange interest rate and credit spread together in one portfolio it is measured as the difference between the sum of the var by individual risk type and the combined total var a negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification as the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures the total var is nonadditive across risk types due to diversification effects for presentation purposes portfolio diversification of the var for trading portfolios includes varbased risknotinvar refer to treasury risk management above for disclosure of our nontrading var backtesting we routinely validate the accuracy of our var models by backtesting them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes nonmodeled items such as fees commissions and revenues of intraday transactions from the actual reported profit and loss we would expect under stable market conditions to experience two or three losses in excess of var at the hsbc usa inc percent confidence level over a oneyear period however in periods of unstable market conditions we could see an increase in the number of backtesting exceptions during the first quarter of we experienced no loss backtesting exception hsbc usa inc consolidated average balances and interest rates the following table summarizes the quartertodate average daily balances of
