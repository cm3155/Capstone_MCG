may also be referred to in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda as we us or our economic environment the us economy continued to grow during the first nine months of despite continued pressures from high inflation and rising interest rates which are expected to lead to a slowdown of future economic growth in addition bank failures earlier in the year have raised concerns about potential weakness in the banking sector which has contributed to tighter credit conditions for households and businesses further weighing on economic activity us gross domestic product gdp grew at an estimated annual rate of percent in the third quarter of while the personal consumption expenditures price index of percent in september remained above the frbs target inflation rate after increasing shortterm interest rates by a total of basis points during the first eight months of the frb decided to hold shortterm interest rates steady in september while indicating that an additional rate increase during the fourth quarter of is likely depending upon future economic conditions although economic conditions improved during the third quarter of driven by better than expected economic growth economic uncertainty remains due to high inflation rising interest rates and the expectation for slowing future economic growth which will continue to impact our business in future periods concerns over domestic and global policy issues trade policy in the us and geopolitical events including the recent turmoil in the middle east as well as the implications of those events on the markets in general further add to the global uncertainty there is also a risk that interest rate increases to fight inflation could lead to a recession interest rate levels inflation and economic growth in combination with global economic conditions fiscal and monetary policy and the level of regulatory and government scrutiny of financial institutions will continue to impact our results in and beyond performance developments and trends regional bank failures earlier in triggered turmoil throughout the banking industry as contagion fears spread to date we have not experienced any significant impact to our liquidity deposits or funding capabilities as a result of this industry turmoil in may the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic issued a proposed rule that would impose a special assessment on certain fdicinsured banks including hsbc bank usa to recover the loss to the deposit insurance fund arising from the protection of uninsured depositors following a determination of systemic risk in connection with the failures of silicon valley bank and signature bank the special assessment would be based on an insured depository institutions estimated uninsured deposits reported as of december and would be collected over eight quarterly assessment periods beginning with the first quarter of if finalized as proposed the special assessment is expected to result in approximately million of additional deposit insurance assessment fees for husi which will be accrued once the rule becomes final which is expected to occur in the fourth quarter because the estimated loss to the deposit insurance fund will be periodically adjusted as actual losses are incurred the fdic would retain the ability to cease collection early or extend the special assessment collection period as needed during the second quarter of we transferred certain commercial real estate loans to held for sale with a carrying value of million as part of an effort to reduce exposure to this sector we recorded a lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment of million upon transferring these loans to held for sale during the third quarter of a portion of these loans with a carrying value of million was transferred back to held for investment resulting in the reversal of million of the lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustment see note loans held for sale in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information during the second quarter of we paid a dividend on our common stock of billion from retained earnings to hsbc north america in september our markets and securities services business segment entered into an agreement to refer transactions related to all future precious metals trading and financing activities associated with our global banking clients to hsbc bank plc we continue to provide sales and trading services to hsbc bank plc in support of these activities which allows us to record sales commissions and performance fees for such activities while holding fewer assets on our balance sheet as the transfer was between affiliates under common control the consideration received in excess of our carrying value resulted in an increase to additional paidincapital of million net of tax in conjunction with the agreement during the third quarter of we also transferred a portion of our precious

during the three and nine months ended september respectively income before income tax was million and million during the three and nine months ended september respectively compared with million and million during the three and nine months ended september respectively the increase in income before income tax during the three months ended september was due primarily to higher other revenues driven by higher trading revenue and to a lesser extent a lower provision for credit losses these increases were partially offset by lower net interest income as interest expense on deposits and interest bearing liabilities grew faster than interest income on loans and interest bearing assets in the yeartodate period the increase in income before income tax was due primarily to higher other revenues driven by higher trading revenue also contributing to the increase were lower operating expenses driven by the completion of our strategic plan to restructure our operations restructuring plan including the nonrecurrence of million of costs related to the delivery of our restructuring plan costs to achieve recorded during the nine months ended september as hsbc usa inc discussed further below as well as a lower provision for credit losses these increases were partially offset by lower net interest income for the reasons discussed above as previously disclosed we completed our restructuring plan over the threeyear period of costs to achieve primarily consisted of lease impairment and other related costs severance costs and allocated costs from hsbc technology services usa

financial information to hsbc in accordance with hsbc group accounting and reporting policies which apply international financial reporting standards ifrss as issued by the iasb as a result our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of hsbc groups accounting and reporting policies group reporting basis because operating results on the group reporting basis are used in managing our businesses and rewarding performance of employees our management also separately monitors profit before tax under this basis of reporting the following

note business segments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of significant changes since december in the differences between us gaap and the group reporting basis impacting our results differences in reported profit before tax in the table above that were individually significant for the periods presented are explained below during the nine months ended september other longlived assets in the table above reflects a reversal of million of impairment charges under the group reporting basis related to capitalized software and leasehold improvements primarily associated with our wealth and personal banking business segment which were previously writtenoff in we recorded an impairment charge under the group reporting basis related to the writeoff of all the capitalized software and a portion of the leasehold improvements primarily associated with our wealth and personal banking business segment while under us gaap no impairment charge was required subsequent to recognition of the impairment charge in expenditures for software hsbc usa inc development and newly completed leasehold improvements in our wealth and personal banking business segment were capitalized and amortized over their useful lives under us gaap but not under the group reporting basis consequently the carrying amounts of capitalized software and leasehold improvements were higher under us gaap than under the group reporting basis and as a result corresponding amortization expense was higher under us gaap during the second quarter of we determined that the cash generating unit was no longer impaired under the group reporting basis and that its estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value which resulted in the reestablishment of these assets at their recoverable amount net of amortization that would have been recorded had no impairment loss been recognized and excluding any assets that have since been sold in addition during the first half of we recorded million of lease related impairment charges under us gaap associated with the exit of certain office space while under the group reporting basis impairment was recognized when we committed to vacate the space in the fourth quarter of during the nine months ended september amortization expense for longlived assets was higher under us gaap due primarily to the impact of the impairment charge recorded under the group reporting basis in as discussed above higher expense under us gaap was partially offset by the impairment of newly completed leasehold improvements in our wealth and personal banking business segment under the group reporting basis while under us gaap they were capitalized and amortized during the nine months ended september we transferred certain loans to held for sale which under us gaap requires the loans to be carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value which resulted in lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments on the loans under the group reporting basis loans held for sale continue to be accounted for and credit losses continue to be measured in accordance with ifrs financial instruments with any gain or loss recorded at the time of sale during the nine months ended september loans held for sale in the table above reflects a higher gain on loan sales under the group reporting basis than under us gaap which includes the gain on sale of the branch disposal group the higher gain under the group reporting basis was due primarily to the releases of credit loss reserves previously recorded on the loans under us gaap when they were transferred to held for sale in as well as the higher carrying amount of leasehold improvements associated with the sold branches under us gaap at the time of sale these leasehold improvements were previously determined to be impaired and writtenoff under the group reporting basis as discussed above in addition during the three and nine months ended september we recorded lower of amortized cost or fair value adjustments on loans held for sale under us gaap while under the group reporting basis loans held for sale continue to be accounted for and credit losses continue to be measured in accordance with ifrs with any gain or loss recorded at the time of sale during the three and nine months ended september we transferred certain precious metals trading client relationships to an affiliate which under the group reporting basis required the gain to be recorded in earnings under us gaap since the transfer was between affiliates under common control the gain was reflected as a capital transaction and recorded in common equity as a component of additional paidin capital see note business segments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion during the three and nine months ended september expected credit losses were higher under us gaap than under the group reporting basis under the group reporting basis a majority of our loans are considered to be in stage which requires a 12month expected credit losses estimate while under us gaap such loans require a lifetime expected credit losses ecl estimate primarily as a result of the different requirements loss provisions driven by the weakening of economic conditions which resulted in a worsening of economic forecasts and in the yeartodate period higher provisions associated with loan growth and maturity extensions were more pronounced under us gaap in addition during the third quarter of we released credit reserves under the group reporting basis related to a decline in unused credit card lines reflecting completion of the temporary servicing agreement we entered into associated with the sale of a portfolio of mass market retail credit cards during the fourth quarter of under us gaap unused credit card lines are considered unconditionally cancellable and are not reserved for hsbc usa inc balance sheet review the following table provides balance

to apply a disciplined lending approach also contributing to the decrease were lower loans to affiliates as well as the transfer of certain commercial real estate loans to held for sale as discussed below the decline in commercial nonaffiliate loans was primarily in the real estate software and diversified financials industries partially offset by an increase in the utilities industry consumer

with the sale of a portfolio of mass market retail credit cards during the fourth quarter of operating expenses increased during the three months ended september due primarily to higher litigation

lower dollars of delinquency in our consumer loan portfolio our commercial loan twomonthsandover contractual delinquency ratio decreased basis points compared with june due primarily to lower dollars of delinquency driven by the payoff of a commercial real estate loan and the collection of a global banking loan both of which became days past due in the second quarter as compared with december our

lower outstanding loan balances our consumer loan twomonthsandover contractual delinquency ratio was relatively flat compared with june and decreased basis points compared with december the decrease

nonaccrual in the second quarter also contributing to the increase in the ratio as compared with december were lower outstanding loan balances our consumer nonperforming loans ratio decreased basis points compared with june due primarily to the collection of a large private banking home equity mortgage loan which had become days past due in the first quarter as compared with december our

measured as the net replacement cost of derivative contracts in a receivable position in the event the counterparties of such contracts fail to perform under the terms of those contracts in managing derivative credit risk both the current exposure which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered counterparties to our derivative activities include financial institutions central clearing parties foreign and domestic government agencies corporations funds mutual funds hedge funds etc insurance companies and private clients as well as other hsbc entities these counterparties are subject to regular credit review by the credit risk management department to minimize credit risk we may enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon occurrence of certain events in addition we reduce credit risk by obtaining collateral from counterparties the determination of the need for and the levels of collateral will differ based on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty andor regulatory requirements the total risk in a derivative contract is a function of a number of variables such as volatility of interest rates currencies equity or corporate reference entity used as the basis for determining contract payments current market events or trends country risk maturity and liquidity of contracts creditworthiness of the counterparties in the transaction the existence of a master netting agreement among the counterparties and existence and value of collateral received from counterparties to secure exposures the table below presents total credit risk exposure calculated using the general riskbased capital rules of the basel iii standardized approach which includes the net positive marktomarket of the derivative contracts plus any adjusted potential future exposure as measured in reference to the notional amount the regulatory capital rules recognize that bilateral netting agreements reduce credit risk and therefore allow for reductions of riskweighted assets when netting requirements have been met and collateral exists as a result riskweighted amounts for regulatory capital purposes are a portion of the original gross exposures furthermore many contracts contain provisions that allow us to close out the transaction if the counterparty fails to post required collateral in addition many contracts give us the right to break the transactions earlier than the final maturity date as a result these contracts have potential future exposures that are often much smaller than the future exposures derived from the regulatory capital rules september december in millions risk associated with derivative contracts total credit risk exposure less collateral held against exposure net credit risk exposure liquidity

commitments to extend credit and in certain cases guarantees commitments to extend credit include arrangements whereby we are contractually obligated to extend credit in the form of loans participations in loans or similar transactions at september and december we had commitments to extend credit totaling billion and billion respectively comprised primarily of commercial commitments and to a lesser extent consumer commitments commercial commitments comprise primarily those related to secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit consumer commitments comprise unused mastercardvisa credit card lines where we have the right to change terms or conditions upon notification to the customer and commitments to extend credit secured by residential properties where we have the right to change terms or conditions for cause upon notification to the customer for a summary of guarantees including standby letters of credit and certain credit derivative transactions as well as the contractual amounts hsbc usa inc outstanding at september and december see note guarantee arrangements pledged asset and repurchase agreements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent our maximum possible credit exposure in the event that a counterparty draws down the full commitment amount or we are required to fulfill our maximum obligation under a guarantee many of these commitments and guarantees expire unused or without default as a result we believe that the contractual amount is not representative of the actual future credit exposure or funding requirements our offbalance sheet arrangements also include transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities vies see note variable interest entities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a summary of these unconsolidated vies fair value fair value hierarchy fair value measurement accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy structure that prioritizes the inputs to determine the fair value of an asset or liability the fair value framework the fair value framework distinguishes between inputs that are based on observed market data and unobservable inputs that reflect market participants assumptions it emphasizes the use of valuation methodologies that maximize observable market inputs for financial instruments carried at fair value the best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market level where the market for a financial instrument is not active valuation techniques are used the majority of our valuation techniques use market inputs that are either observable or indirectly derived from and corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the financial instrument level because level and level instruments are determined by observable inputs less judgment is applied in determining their fair values in the absence of observable market inputs the financial instrument is valued based on valuation techniques that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs level the determination of the level of fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement of an asset or a liability is classified often requires judgment and may change over time as market conditions evolve we consider the following factors in developing the fair value hierarchy whether the asset or liability is transacted in an active market with a quoted market price the level of bidask spreads a lack of pricing transparency due to among other things complexity of the product and market liquidity whether only a few transactions are observed over a significant period of time whether the pricing quotations differ substantially among independent pricing services whether inputs to the valuation techniques can be derived from or corroborated with market data and whether significant adjustments are made to the observed pricing information or model output to determine the fair value level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that the reporting entity has the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities a financial instrument is classified as a level measurement if it is listed on an exchange or is an instrument actively traded in the overthecounter otc market where transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume we regard financial instruments such as debt securities equity securities and derivative contracts listed on the primary exchanges of a country to be actively traded nonexchangetraded instruments classified as level assets include securities issued by the us treasury tobeannounced securities noncallable securities issued by us government sponsored enterprises and certain foreign governmentbacked debt level inputs are those that are observable either directly or indirectly but do not qualify as level inputs we classify mortgage passthrough securities agency and certain nonagency mortgage collateralized obligations nonexchangetraded derivative contracts assetbacked securities obligations of us states and political subdivisions corporate debt securities certain foreign governmentbacked debt preferred securities securities purchased and sold under resale and repurchase agreements precious metals certain loans held for sale certain student loans residential mortgage loans whose carrying amount was reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral real estate owned and certain client share repurchase transactions as level measurements where possible at least two quotations from independent sources are obtained based on transactions involving comparable assets and liabilities to validate the fair value of these instruments we have established a process to understand the methodologies and inputs used by the third party pricing services to ensure that pricing information meets the fair value objective and where appropriate this pricing data is backtested to market trade executions where significant differences arise among the independent pricing quotes and the internally determined fair value we investigate and reconcile the differences if the investigation results in a significant adjustment to the fair value the instrument will be classified as level within the fair value hierarchy in general we have observed that there is a correlation between the credit standing and the market liquidity of a nonderivative instrument hsbc usa inc level derivative instruments are generally valued based on discounted future cash flows or an option pricing model adjusted for counterparty credit risk and market liquidity the fair value of certain derivative products is determined using valuation techniques based on inputs derived from observable indices traded in the otc market appropriate control processes and procedures have been applied to ensure that the derived inputs are applied to value only those instruments that share similar risks to the relevant benchmark indices and therefore demonstrate a similar response to market factors level inputs are unobservable estimates that management expects market participants would use to determine the fair value of the asset or liability that is level inputs incorporate market participants assumptions about risk and the risk premium required by market participants in order to bear that risk we develop level inputs based on the best information available in the circumstances at september and december our level measurements included the following certain structured deposits and structured notes for which the embedded derivatives have significant unobservable inputs eg volatility or default correlations certain assetbacked securities individually assessed commercial loans mortgage servicing rights derivatives with certain inputs which are unobservable certain credit default swaps certain loans held for sale and swap agreements entered into in conjunction with the sales of visa class b shares for which the fair value is dependent upon the final resolution of the related litigation see note fair value measurements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on level inputs level measurements the following table provides information about level assetsliabilities in relation to total assetsliabilities measured at fair value at september and december september december  are in millions level assets total assets measured at fair value level liabilities total liabilities measured at fair value level assets as a percent of total assets measured at fair value level liabilities as a percent of total liabilities measured at fair value presented without netting which allows the offsetting of amounts relating to certain contracts if certain conditions are met includes million of recurring level assets and million of nonrecurring level assets at september includes million of recurring level assets and million of nonrecurring level assets at december includes million of assets measured on a recurring basis and million of assets measured on a nonrecurring basis at september includes million of assets measured on a recurring basis and million of assets measured on a nonrecurring basis at december significant changes in fair value for level assets and liabilities see note fair value measurements in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on additions to and transfers into out of level measurements during the three and nine months ended september and as well as for further details including the classification hierarchy associated with assets and liabilities measured at fair value effect of changes in significant unobservable inputs the fair value of certain financial instruments is measured using valuation techniques that incorporate pricing assumptions not supported by derived from or corroborated by observable market data the resultant fair value measurements are dependent on unobservable input parameters which can be selected from a range of estimates and may be interdependent changes in one or more of the significant unobservable input parameters may change the fair value measurements of these financial instruments for the purpose of preparing the financial statements the final valuation inputs selected are based on managements best judgment that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing similar assets or liabilities the unobservable input parameters selected are subject to the internal valuation control processes and procedures when we perform a test of all the significant input parameters to the extreme values within the range at the same time it could result in an increase of the overall fair value measurement of approximately million or a decrease of the overall fair value measurement of approximately million at september the effect of changes in significant unobservable input parameters are primarily driven by the uncertainty in determining the fair value of certain creditlinked structured notes

colleagues and the communities that we serve while ensuring we are able to support our strategy and provide sustainable growth we aim to use a comprehensive risk management approach across the organization and across all risk types underpinned by our culture and values this is outlined in our risk management framework including the key principles and practices that we employ in managing material risks both financial and nonfinancial this framework fosters continuous monitoring promotes risk awareness and encourages sound operational and strategic decisionmaking and escalation processes it also supports a consistent approach to identifying assessing managing and reporting the risks we accept and incur in our activities with clear accountabilities our board of directors has the ultimate responsibility for the effective oversight of risk management and approves our risk appetite it is advised on risk matters by the risk committee of the board of directors notably risk appetite and its alignment with our strategy risk governance and internal controls as well as highlevel risk related matters we use a defined executive risk governance structure to help ensure there is appropriate oversight and accountability embedded throughout our business for the effective management of risk our material risks the principal risks associated with our operations include the following credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract treasury risk is the risk of having insufficient capital liquidity or funding resources to meet financial obligations and satisfy regulatory requirements including the risk of an adverse impact on earnings due to changes in market interest rates together with pension risk market risk is the risk of an adverse financial impact on trading activities arising from changes in market parameters such as interest rates foreign exchange rates asset prices volatilities correlations and credit spreads climate risk relates to the financial and nonfinancial impacts that may arise as a result of climate change and the move to a greener economy resilience risk is the risk that we are unable to provide critical services to our customers affiliates and counterparties as a result of sustained and significant operational disruption regulatory compliance risk is the risk associated with breaching our duty to clients and other counterparties inappropriate market conduct and breaching related financial services regulatory standards financial crime risk is the risk of knowingly or unknowingly helping parties to commit or to further potentially illegal activity including money laundering fraud bribery and corruption tax evasion sanctions breaches and terrorist and proliferation financing strategic risk is the risk that the business will fail to identify execute and react appropriately to opportunities andor threats arising from changes in the market some of which may emerge over a number of years such as changing economic and political circumstances customer requirements demographic trends regulatory developments or competitor action and model risk is the risk of inappropriate or incorrect business decisions arising from the use of models that have been inadequately designed implemented or used or from models that do not perform in line with expectations and predictions in the course of our regular risk management activities we use models to help quantify the risk we are taking we believe that the assumptions used in these models are reasonable within the parameters for which the models have been built and calibrated to operate but events may unfold differently than what is assumed in the models adjustments to model outputs to reflect consideration of management judgment are used with stringent governance in place to ensure appropriate results where models do not require adjustments enhanced model monitoring confirms models

management approach includes deposits supplemented by wholesale borrowing to fund our balance sheet and using security sales or secured borrowings for liquidity stress situations in our liquidity contingency plans in addition regulations require banks to retain a portfolio of hqla as such we are maintaining a large portfolio of high quality sovereign and sovereign guaranteed securities our ability to regularly attract wholesale funds at a competitive cost is enhanced by strong ratings from the major credit rating agencies the following table reflects the short and longterm credit ratings of hsbc usa and hsbc bank usa at september moodys sp fitch hsbc usa shortterm borrowings p1 a2 f1 longtermsenior debt a1 a a hsbc bank usa shortterm borrowings p1 a1 f1 longtermsenior debt aa3 a aa rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends regulatory developments future profitability risk management practices and legal matters all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions although we closely monitor and strive to manage factors influencing our credit ratings there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not change in the future in july moodys placed on review for downgrade the longterm debt ratings of hsbc usa reflecting the decrease in loss absorbing capacity debt outstanding at hsbc north america at september none of the other ratings on the debt of hsbc usa or hsbc bank usa from any of the rating agencies were under hsbc usa inc review for potential downgrade in october moodys concluded their review and downgraded the longterm debt ratings of hsbc usa by one notch including the senior debt rating which was downgraded to a2 from a1 the outlook for the senior debt ratings of hsbc usa is stable while these rating actions are not expected to have a material financial impact on our borrowing costs or liquidity any additional future actions could have such an impact see liquidity and capital resources in this mda for further discussion of our liquidity position including additional information regarding our outstanding borrowings the remaining availability of our debt issuance programs and our funding strategy interest rate risk various techniques are utilized to quantify and monitor risks associated with the repricing characteristics of our assets liabilities and derivative contracts see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of our approach to interest rate risk economic value of equity eve eve represents the present value of the banking book cash flows that could be provided to our equity holder under a managed runoff scenario an eve sensitivity represents the change in eve due to a defined movement in interest rates we manage to an immediate parallel upward shock of basis points and an immediate parallel downward shock of basis points to the market implied interest rates at both september and december our eve remained within risk limits for the up and down basis point interest rate shock scenarios net interest income simulation modeling techniques we utilize simulation modeling to monitor a number of interest rate scenarios for their impact on projected net interest income these techniques simulate the impact on projected net interest income under various scenarios such as rate shock scenarios which assume immediate market rate movements by basis points as well as scenarios in which rates gradually rise or fall by basis points over a twelve month period in the gradual scenarios percent of the interest rate movement occurs at the beginning of each quarter the following table reflects the impact on our projected net interest income of the scenarios utilized by these modeling techniques september december amount amount dollars are in millions estimated increase decrease in projected net interest income reflects projected rate movements on october and january respectively resulting from a gradual basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from a gradual basis point decrease in the yield curve other significant scenarios monitored reflects projected rate movements on october and january respectively resulting from an immediate basis point increase in the yield curve resulting from an immediate basis point decrease in the yield curve the projections do not take into consideration possible complicating factors such as the effect of changes in interest rates on the credit quality size and composition of the balance sheet therefore although this provides a reasonable estimate of interest rate sensitivity actual results will differ from these estimates possibly by significant amounts nontrading value at risk var nontrading var predominantly relates to markets treasury and represents the potential negative changes in the investment portfolio market value which includes availableforsale and heldtomaturity assets and associated hedges our investment portfolio holdings comprise mainly us treasury us government agency mortgagebacked and us government sponsored mortgagebacked securities our nontrading var exposure is driven by interest rates and agency spread volatility refer to market risk management below for further discussion regarding var and the management of market risk in our nontrading portfolios hsbc usa inc the following table summarizes our nontrading var for the nine months ended september and at december credit spread interest rate portfolio diversification total in millions at september nine months ended september average maximum minimum at december refer to the trading var table in market risk management below for additional information nontrading var also includes the interest rate risk of nontrading financial assets and liabilities held by the global businesses and transfer priced into markets treasury which has the mandate to centrally manage and hedge it market risk management exposure to market risk is separated into two portfolios trading portfolios comprise positions arising from marketmaking and warehousing of clientderived positions nontrading portfolios comprise positions that primarily arise from the interest rate management of our retail and commercial banking assets and liabilities and financial investments classified as availableforsale and heldtomaturity we apply similar risk management policies and measurement techniques to both trading and nontrading portfolios our objective is to manage and control market risk exposures to optimize return on risk while maintaining a market profile consistent with our established risk appetite see risk management in mda in our form 10k for a more complete discussion of our approach to market risk value at risk var var is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions as a result of movements in market rates and prices over a specified time horizon and to a given level of confidence the use of var is integrated into market risk management and calculated for all trading positions regardless of how we capitalize them in addition we calculate var for nontrading portfolios to have a complete picture of risk var measures are calculated to a percent confidence level and use a oneday holding period trading var trading var is generated principally from trading activities within the mss segment of gbm these include positions in interest rates foreign exchange precious metals ie gold silver platinum and credit default swaps in september we entered into derivative transactions to transfer the substantial majority of the market risk associated with our precious metals trading positions to hsbc bank plc where it will be centrally managed going forward the following graph summarizes daily var for our trading portfolios at a percent confidence level in millions hsbc usa inc the following table summarizes our trading var for the nine months ended september and at december credit spread foreign exchange and commodity interest rate portfolio diversification total in millions at september nine months ended september average maximum minimum at december portfolio diversification is the market risk dispersion effect of holding a portfolio containing different risk types it represents the reduction in unsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types for example foreign exchange interest rate and credit spread together in one portfolio it is measured as the difference between the sum of the var by individual risk type and the combined total var a negative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification as the maximum and minimum occur on different days for different risk types it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification benefit for these measures the total var is nonadditive across risk types due to diversification effects for presentation purposes portfolio diversification of the var for trading portfolios includes varbased risknotinvar refer to treasury risk management above for disclosure of our nontrading var backtesting we routinely validate the accuracy of our var models by backtesting them against hypothetical profit and loss that excludes nonmodeled items such as fees commissions and revenues of intraday transactions from the actual reported profit and loss we would expect under stable market conditions to experience two or three losses in excess of var at the percent confidence level over a oneyear period however in periods of unstable market conditions we could see an increase in the number of backtesting exceptions during the nine months ended september we experienced no loss backtesting exceptions hsbc usa inc consolidated average balances and interest rates the following table summarizes the quartertodate and
