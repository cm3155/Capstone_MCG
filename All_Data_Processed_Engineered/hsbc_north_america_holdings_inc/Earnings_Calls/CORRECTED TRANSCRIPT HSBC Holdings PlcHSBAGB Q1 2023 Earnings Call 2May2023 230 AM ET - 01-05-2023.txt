management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the investor and analysts conference call for hsbc holdings plcs  results for your information this conference is being recorded at this time i will hand the call over to mr richard oconnor group head of investor relations richard oconnor global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc thank you operator good morning good afternoon everyone before i hand over to noel i want to give a quick reminder of reporting changes that have taken effect this quarter the numbers in the presentation today are on an ifrs basis and thank you to all those who attended the teachin in march our focus is now on reported numbers but we will call out and specify notable items our global businesses are still the primary basis of our reporting but we have moved to legal entity rather than geographic regions as our secondary reporting line consensus hasnt yet fully caught up with all these changes but now weve made them we believe they will give you more clarity transparency and ultimately benefit your modeling going forward noel over to you noel quinn group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thanks richard and good morning in london good afternoon in hong kong and thank you for joining our first quarter results call georges is going to lead the presentation but id like to make some opening comments weve announced a strong set of  results we delivered a strong profit performance which was spread across all our major geographies all three global businesses performed well and cost discipline remained tight in the first quarter excluding the gain on svb uk on the partreversal of the impairment on the potential sale of our french retail bank we delivered an annualized return on tangible equity of so our strategy is working im also confident about the future for two main reasons first we have built a good platform for growth we have a strong balance sheet broad base geographic profit generation a good combination of net interest income and nonnet interest income and a tight grip on costs this growth potential was evident in the inflow of new invested assets of billion in the quarter with a cumulative billion over the last months which shows that our wealth strategy is continuing to gain traction and you have my commitment that we will continue to drive strong performance for the rest of the year while maintaining cost discipline and investing in growth the second reason im confident is the diversity and connectivity of our geographical footprint where we have access to markets that are exhibiting good growth and return potential ive seen firsthand the strong economic recovery is underway in hong kong and mainland china ive also visited the middle east recently where i saw a strong economy that is wellplaced to continue to grow and the uk economy is also showing good resilience and our hsbc uk business is performing well investing in growth is critical and we saw an opportunity to do that by acquiring svb uk for years hsbc has banked the entrepreneurs who have created todays industrial base with the svb uk acquisition we have hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02may2023 access to more of the entrepreneurs in the technology and life sciences sectors who will create the businesses of tomorrow we believe there are natural fit for hsbc and that were well and uniquely placed to take them global you will have seen the recent hires that weve taken on in the us in that regard and we continue and were going to continue to invest to grow this part of the business on a global basis we announced that the sale of our french retail bank has become less certain due to significant interest rate rises in france and the related fair value accounts in treatment impacting the capital position of the purchaser we still believe its right to sell the business but we also have to keep our shareholders interests in mind when negotiating revised terms we are working with the buyer to try and find a solution but the uncertainty on deal terms and timing has led us to reverse the impairment finally we made two important announcements today the first was the resumption of quarterly dividends with an interim dividend of per share which is the same level as the last time we paid a first quarterly dividend before covid the second was that good continued capital generation enabled us to announce a share buyback of up to billion our agm on friday will be an important milestone as you know resolutions have been tabled by shareholders on the strategy and structure of the bank as well as to fix the dividends the board has recommended that shareholders vote against resolutions and i believe our first quarter results reinforced our recommendations and demonstrate that our current strategy is the fastest and safest way to improve returns ill now hand over to georges to take you through the numbers georges elhedery chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you noel and a warm welcome to all of you thank you for being with us on this call today let me begin with the first quarter highlights profit before tax was billion up billion on the first quarter of on a constant currency basis this was driven by an billion increase in revenue which includes billion from the partreversal of the impairment relating to the potential sale of our retail banking operations in france and the billion provisional gain on the acquisition of svb uk credit performance was benign with expected credit losses of billion costs were up in the first quarter against our target of limiting cost growth to circa on a constant currency basis and excluding notable items and hyperinflation our annualized return on tangible equity was or excluding the gain on svb uk and the part reversal of the impairment on the potential sale of our french retail bank and as noel said were providing strong capital returns in the form of the first quarterly dividend since of per share and a share buyback of up to billion which we expect to start after the agm and complete in around three months going into more detail net interest income of billion was up billion or on the first quarter of and was stable on the fourth quarter on an ifrs basis nonnet interest income of billion was up billion which includes billion of notable items in the first quarter and was driven by strong performances in markets and securities services and in wealth lending balances increased by billion in the quarter on a constant currency basis this was made up of billion from the reclassification of balances associated with our retail banking operations in france and billion from svb uk deposits also increased in the quarter due to the same factors if we excluded these items lending and deposits were both stable hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02may2023 the tax charge of billion included a credit of billion and the cet1 ratio was which was an increase of basis points on the fourth quarter and included a 30basis point gain relating to the part reversal of the france impairment and the svb uk acquisition as noel said all of our global businesses performed well this slide gives you the evidence for that wealth and personal banking had a strong quarter with revenues up within this wealth was up driven by the economic resurgence in asia and increasing traction from the investment weve made in digitization and in people personal banking also had another good quarter up benefiting from our strong deposit franchise across both commercial banking and global banking end markets the global payments services had revenues of billion which was an increase of on the first quarter of global banking end markets also performed well overall markets and securities services revenue in particular were up with a strong performance in foreign exchange reported net interest income was billion which included billion of interest expense due to the funding costs booked in corporate center to fund the trading books this was offset by billion of nonnet interest income reported in corporate center on a reported basis the net interest margin was up by basis points on the first quarter of last year and up by basis point on the fourth quarter for the avoidance of doubt our net interest income guidance is unchanged from our full year results on an ifrs basis we expect to achieve net interest income of at least billion in this is equivalent to at least billion of net interest income on an ifrs basis which was what we told you in february our current view is that the things we told you about net interest income at our full year results remain unchanged non net interest income of billion was up substantially by billion which was a combination of one billion of notable items in the first quarter two a global banking end markets trading income increase of billion three a billion increase in corporate center income for funding global banking end markets trading activity and four other income which grew by billion and included higher wealth revenues fees were broadly stable compared to the first quarter of with a good payments fee performance partially offset by lower wealth fees however net new invested assets in the quarter were billion and billion for the last months which bodes well for future growth i called out the global business revenue highlights earlier and there is a detailed nonnet interest income breakdown on slide our credit performance in the quarter was benign with a billion charge for expected credit losses which was billion lower than the first quarter last year this reflected a favorable shift in the probability weightings of our economic downside scenarios as well as low stage losses china cre was also benign with a small charge relating to technical adjustments for two customers we saw no china cre defaults in the quarter for the first time since the fourth quarter of though there were also limited repayments we are encouraged by the first quarter but there are still downside risks so our guidance remains unchanged at a charge of around basis points of average gross customer lending including heldforsale balances we will review this at our interim results on a constant currency basis and excluding notable items costs were up by in the first quarter once we also exclude the impact of retranslating prioryear costs in hyperinflationary economies at constant currency as you can see most of the spend was on technology we remain committed to limiting cost growth to approximately in on that basis hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02may2023 as i shared at the year end one of my top priorities is cost discipline equally i also shared that another of my top priorities is to support our businesses to deliver growth and returns the acquisition of svb uk was an opportunity to do that this is expected to result in incremental cost growth of circa to group operating expenses the majority of which is the acquired cost base of svb uk together with some additional investment in the uk and other geographies and this will be in addition to our target of limiting cost growth to circa finally at year end we also flagged million of expected severance costs this year a large portion of these severance costs are now expected to be incurred in the second quarter with the cost benefits starting to come through in the second half of this year moving on we usually include information on customer deposits in the appendix but we have moved it up to the presentation this time because we appreciate the current interest overall customer deposits are stable yearon year and quarteronquarter of the trillion of deposits we hold half are invested in highquality liquid assets which gives you a sense of our strong liquidity position this is a historic feature of the way that hsbc manages its balance sheet and it has not changed around of our highquality liquid assets are held in cash or cash equivalents and there are only around billion of unrealized losses in our heldtocollect portfolio which is down from around billion at the end of three main points on capital one our cet1 ratio was up basis points on the previous quarter basis points of which was from the reclassification of our french retail business from heldforsale pending the outcome of negotiations for our french retail bank there would be a commensurate reduction to cet1 in the event that the deal closes number two as you know our business in canada remains classified as held for sale and we now expect the transaction to complete in the first quarter of as we work with the purchaser to ensure a smooth transition we continue to expect to pay the potential special dividend of per share in the first half of and as previously indicated we expect almost all excess capital from the canada transaction accruing into cet1 to be returned to shareholders primarily through a rolling series of share buybacks in and that would be incremental to any existing buyback program at that time number three share buybacks remain an active part of our capital management plans and we will update you on our assumptions for share buybacks in and beyond at our interim results so in summary this was a strong quarter it was a strong profit performance net interest income was stable strict cost discipline was maintained which i told you would remain a key focus area for myself and the management team our credit performance was benign amid a more positive economic outlook we are starting to see the impact of strong economic rebounds in hong kong and mainland china and our wealth strategy is gaining traction and i am pleased there was strong capital returns a quarterly dividend of per share and the share buyback of up to billion which we expect to start after the agm and complete in around three months as noel said we are clearly on track to meet our returns target for onwards and this upward trajectory would give us substantial distribution capacity including of course the potential proceeds from the canada transaction with that operator can we please open it up for questions thank you hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02may2023 question and answer section operator thank you mr elhedery operator instructions our first question today comes from joseph dickerson with jefferies your line is open joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd hi good morning gentlemen congrats on a good set of numbers in what wasnt the easiest environment in  noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc hi joe indiscernible thank you for that joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd just a quick question on the buyback youve been very precise in discussing that you would expect to complete the buyback over three months is this something now we can expect to be a regular quarterly event given the strong capital generation not to mention canada completing early next year or is it going to be slightly more erratic noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc joe thank you for your question ill ask georges to answer that thank you georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you joe yes indeed so first we are hoping to achieve billion in the next three month in the past weve managed to achieve between billion and billion in a quarter obviously we have five month to complete this program we are hoping to complete it in three months going forward were certainly considering a rolling series of buybacks in those will be supported by organic capital generation as well as the canada sale proceeds in and joe it remains our intention to return excess capital including the canada proceeds if the conditions justify it noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you joe joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd great thats lovely noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you next question please hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02may2023 operator thank you mr elhedery our next question today comes from raul sinha with jpmorgan your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc hi raul raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc good morning gents thanks very much for taking my questions maybe just to follow up on that capital return question firstly and then i have got another one on asset quality when we look at your headline capital ratio obviously its very strong and quite a significant pickup over the last couple of quarters in particular i guess there are a few adjusting items in there should we kind of exclude the french disposal thats a reversal from the headline ratio and i guess if we exclude the share buyback we kind of get back in your range towards the lower end so i guess the question is how much rwa growth do you anticipate the business to require over the next sort of months and linking to your loan growth outlook as well im just wondering if you could give us some color on rwa growth expectations there and that hopefully gives us a good idea of how much buybacks we can expect the second one again related to how much capital you might be able to generate in the remaining part of the year your guidance on asset quality still implies quite a significant pickup in provisions given your very strong performance in  so i guess the question really is are you guiding us to something specific in terms of the basis point provision charge or is that just an element of conservatism built into your guidance there thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc georges do you want to take both of those i can always add something to the asset quality later but you take both of those georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc sure noel and thank you raul so on your first question raul i think it is prudent to adjust for the french part reversal of the impairment insofar that capital is concerned as indicated if we do reach a transaction there is a likelihood of a commensurate kind of capital reduction taking place now just to remind you our capital target operating range is to and we expect this to be reviewed slightly lower in the medium to long term and as we do our capital return projections or our share buyback projections we look at our mediumterm capital outlook and compare it to that range and this is and obviously cautiously compare it to that range and this is whats giving us now the flexibility to announce the share buyback and to consider additional buybacks going forward as regards rwa growth in line with loan growth it has been subdued in the first quarter it may remain subdued for another quarter we may see some pickup particularly with the hong kong and china bounceback but again for this year we have not given guidance on loan growth recognizing some of the economic conditions we do remain committed for medium term or midsingle digit growth in loans for the medium term which is what you can factor in for rwa growth commensurately and equally for our share buyback hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02may2023 if i move on to your next question with regards asset quality i would lean towards your latter comment joe sorry raul that we are baking in some conservatism or we think at this stage the fullyear guidance which we have retained unchanged from february is now leaning towards conservative just want to highlight some tailwinds certainly the situation in the uk the possibility that we may dodge a recession is a tailwind equally the recovery in hong kong and mainland china following the opening up of the borders and resumption of activities and trade is a tailwind but at the same time and obviously the china real estate has shown some positive signs both from the economic standpoint as well from the policy measures but at the same time we wanted to remain cautious there are a number of refinancing taking place in  in the china commercial real estate portfolio which we would like to stay cautious on and we continue to watch some of the uk sme space in particular those heavily reliant on discretionary consumer spend before we revisit the guidance we intend to revisit this guidance at the h1 noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc just one additional comment from me please if i can youll notice on the capital schedule i cant remember what slide it was but theres a capital walk on cet1 and in there youll see that weve accrued dividends of of the profit generation in  and if you do the maths on that the accrual on dividend is higher than the that youve got in the  declared interim dividend so were accruing capital distribution at a higher rate a dividend distribution at a higher rate than the payment of the so thats just factored into our cet1 ratio as well thank you next question please raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc thank you very much operator thank you and the next question today comes from manus costello with autonomous your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc manus hi manus costello q analyst autonomous good morning thanks for taking the questions a couple please on a slide you were talking about noel about the the rwa walk i noticed that the riskweighted assets from silicon valley just short of billion which seems quite high relative to the loans that you have taken i wondered if you could share with us what the nature of those assets is and give us an indication about asset quality within the silicon valley bank acquisition and what youve seen so far and then secondly with the thought to the structure of the group youve obviously showed some willingness to make some acquisitions recently and you did some disposals where possible i just wondered if there will be any interest in further moves and particularly im wondering if there will be anything around some of your businesses such as insurance manufacturing which you might think about being noncore to the group going forward hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02may2023 noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you thanks manus just on the asset quality of svb everything that weve seen since we bought the business i dont know i lost track of time must be about six seven weeks ago now its been a busy quarter everything weve seen reinforces the view that we had that we can when we did due diligence that the book was a good quality book weve seen no nasty surprises we did do a bit of marktomarket on acquisition accounting but that was evidence was when we did due diligence that weekend georges can give you a little bit more detail on that but fundamentally the asset quality of the svb book is as we expected it the team has done a good job in building that business over the past years theyve got good client relations a good quality book and good business development potential and on the back of that we decided to invest in putting more people on the ground in some of the key markets around the world that have strong technology and life science centers to take that business model not just to the uk but to take it globally so were invested in that as well so no nasty surprises on that and then in terms of other acquisitions that we may consider or ma activity i mean i think the insurance business is a key component of the wealth proposition that we have we have a very profitable insurance business in hong kong its a combination of manufacturing and distribution the team has done a good job in building out the product lineup in hong kong over the past few years to put us back into a marketleading position in hong kong and we get access to the full value chain one of the challenges weve often faced in the past is getting full recognition of that value as a bank shareholder in an asset in an insurance manufacturing business but you can rest assured the economics of that business are very strong and weve got a marketleading position so we obviously like all businesses keep the strategy under review and if we think theres a better position to take well take it but at the moment were pleased with the way the insurance business is performing georges was there anything else you wanted to add on georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc maybe just getting some of the math so we acquired the loan book that is just shy of billion thats about billion weve acquired billion of rwa so if you consider those loans and some of the additional rwas on treasury books operational risk et cetera you kind of land on these numbers and manus we also acquired billion of capital after the fair value adjustments so youre talking about effectively a cet1 ratio business that we acquired so we think it is where it should be noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you next question please manus costello q analyst autonomous thank you very much operator thank you and our next question comes from omar keenan with credit suisse your line is open hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02may2023 noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc omar hi omar keenan q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd good morning thank you very much hi thank you very much for taking the question i just had a quick question on rate sensitivity and if i look at your rate sensitivity at the end of it looks like youve been quite purposefully bringing down your rate sensitivity on the ph year view and i was hoping you can perhaps give us a little bit of color of the direction that sensitivity over ph one year have changed in the first couple of months of the year can we assume that some of the structural hedges have been rather increased and will we see the sensitivity at the interim might have reduced further any kind of color indiscernible would be really helpful thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc georges do you want to answer that georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc sure thank you omar so at the end of the rate sensitivity on the downside basis point scenario was reduced from around billion at the half year to around billion that billion reduction for nii sensitivity reduction for basis point is for about a third of it justified by the structural hedges that we started putting in place or that we continued putting in place as of last year and twothirds of it is due to the fact that were at just higher level of rates and therefore we have less negative convexity on the downside if you look into  we have not published a revised rate sensitivity but we continued the trajectory of our structural hedges now just as a reminder structural hedges will reduce somewhat our rate sensitivity and our target is to take that billion in the medium term to circa billion and we are on that journey we certainly have not arrived there well be giving you an update at h1 i think ive addressed your points actually omar noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah excellent thanks georges thanks omar next question please operator thank you the next question is from perlie mong with kbw your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc hi perlie thank you perlie mong q analyst kbw hello ive got two questions the first one is well obviously the indiscernible strong and a lot of it comes from noninterest income and it appears that a lot of it is from commercial banking and maybe some from hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02may2023 global banking and market how much of that do you think is sustainable presumably you wouldnt encourage us annualize the whole lot so how much of that do you think is sustainable and secondly is i guess on the agm on friday so i guess a lot of the attention on friday will be around the debate you are having with pan and they obviously recently published an announcement that made some critiques especially around your costincome ratio and rote well youve obviously printed very strong numbers today but indiscernible already especially around indiscernible and im sure youve also been communicating with them anyway so why do you think those critiques were still made noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc okay ill deal with the second one later ill ask georges to deal with the nonnii first if thats okay georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc sure so were expecting many of you will adjust your full year numbers to reflect our  outperformance and thats a fair assessment perlie but ill caution you not to annualize  so if i just unpack it the nonnii relating to the funding of our trading activities billion is fairly reasonable to assume this number will annualize the wealth business obviously with the outlook improving in wealth fairly reasonable to assume we will see regain traction and bounce back in particular in hong kong whereas some of the other activities such as the foreign exchange trading outperformance i would caution you not to annualize this number and just to bake it in as a  outcome and then   well see how they fare noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc so just on the and on the wealth performance so you said most of the nonnii was cmb and gbm i think its also fair to say that in wpb the wealth business performed well in  its revenue was up in  relative to  last year so i think what georges was saying is i think weve seen a recovery taking place in our wealth revenue were not expecting that to just be a  phenomenon that is something that well continue in  and  and  but its still early days to predict whether the is an annual number or its higher than that or lower than that but we dont expect it to disappear in   or  so there should be a level of annualization on that as well in the wpb nonnii line with respect to the agm comment look i think weve said for a while that we believe the safest and fastest way to achieve higher returns better performance better dividends and capital generation was the existing strategy i think the  results provides a lot of evidence that that is the fact that that is the best way we guided the market over the last months to a plus rote i did emphasize at the yearend that we should focus on the plus not the and i think you see in  even excluding the notable items weve done a rote of i would just draw your attention to the fact that in that rote of there is a tax credit and georges could probably cover that as well that tax credit is not something that will repeat every quarter but even if you adjust for that its still a very healthy return on tangible equity so i think its in the what were focused on is driving performance on behalf of all our shareholders and we believe doing what weve done is the best way to get improved returns improved performance rather than some more radical corporate restructuring action so we believe  is strong evidence of that but georges youd just want to clarify the tax situation hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02may2023 georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc so weve basically shown billion as a tax charge which is an effective tax rate of but i just want to caution you that relate to the provisional gain on svb which is a nontaxable item and another relate to the release of provisions for uncertain tax provisions which is also a oneoff item so therefore if you adjusted for those two we still expect a etr guidance for the rest of the year noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you next question please operator thank you the next question comes from andrew coombs with citi your line is open andrew coombs q analyst citigroup global markets ltd good morning one strategic question and then one numbers question on the strategic question if the proposed french retail sale no longer goes ahead what would be the plan would you get back on the block again or would there be a plan to reabsorb it into the broader hsbc group is there anything you can say on plans for france given that sale process and where weve got to secondly on cost youve actually had a very good cost trend this quarter youre down yearonyear on a constant currency basis and yet youre still guiding to cost growth or with svb uk so is this a timing issue is it a case of the wage inflation coming through from  anything you can elaborate there thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc two good questions and georges will cover the second one ill cover the first one i think listen we still believe that the sale of the french retail business is the right strategic outcome that business probably has a stronger future in another purchasers hands however we have been in discussions for a few weeks now with the current buyer to try and overcome the challenge they have on their acquisition accounting impact on their capital base well continue that dialogue were hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable settlement with them on that but we cant be guaranteed of that outcome we have to consider what is financially the right decision for all shareholders and its hopeful that we can reach an agreement but its not guaranteed in the event we cant then i still think well continue to run the business but i still think over time we wouldnt see that as a longterm strategic hold but well have to wait and see what happens thereafter were very much focused on trying to reach an agreement with the current buyer to bring that transaction to a close so thats the update i have for you on cost ill hand over to georges georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc sure noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02may2023 thank you georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you noel and thank you andrew for the question so our reported costs on a constant currency basis is down  last year to  this year if you adjust for notables and remember last year  we had million of additional cost due to the cta program so if you extract that notable item from last years base our reported cost adjusted for notables will show as up  to  this is the basis on which we are measuring ourselves for this year and its on that basis where we are targeting to achieve a annualized number where our quarter one basically is coming in at now why from to just want to highlight a few things the first one is we still havent incurred by and large the severance costs which we announced at the year end and now we expect to incur the majority of it in  this year and the second element just to highlight is that some of the pay increases have only been factored partially in  starting march and will start kind of being fully factored in from  onwards and this is why our target for the full year is where it is and as you said andrew and just for avoidance of any doubt here the acquired cost of svb and some of the additional investments we need to do there will add another to that target noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc so just a couple of additional comments for me on that reconciliation between the headline reporting number and the cost target what were trying to do is be very straightforward and not try and bake in what was a cta last year into the cost base of this year so were adjusting down the prior year reported number for the notable cta last year so that the cost target of is on an applesandapples basis with the cost base of this year so were not looking to take an easy option on that we think its the right thing to do but as we say were against the target in  and then on svb i just want to clarify as well the svb business we bought we acquired a cost base with that and we acquired a revenue stream and that revenue stream was in excess of the cost base so weve acquired a positive pl that was contributing if i remember correctly around about million to million of pbt so although weve acquired million sorry weve acquired the majority of the million is the acquired cost base of svb it is a profitable cost base georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc and andy just to finish off weve provided the reconciliation on slide to show you the work from reported cost to our cost target and we will be showing this slide every quarter noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you next question please operator next question comes from guy stebbings with bnp paribas exane your line is open hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02may2023 georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc hi guy guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas hi morning everyone thanks for taking my questions one on net interest margin and one back on svb so on nim back on svbs so on nim i guess the uk ringfenced bank did quite a lot of heavy lifting this quarter allowing for basis point sequential nim growth as we look ahead perhaps that tailwind space at least in quantum so is that going to make it tricky from here to deliver nim sustainability or is the drop in indiscernible headwind and deposit mix in particular likely to fade in your view to allow for some sort of stable nim backdrop and then the same question on svb in addition to the acquired cost base you flagged in incremental investment spend and plans to build the business outside the uk so could you talk about sort of associated revenue ambitions and what sort of timeframe you expect to see any noticeable uplift there i mean sort of how big a shift in that million to million pbt you referenced could we see of svb indiscernible hsbc with that incremental investment thank you georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc okay thank you ill take the second in a moment ill ask georges to cover the nim please and uk ringfenced bank georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc sure thanks noel thanks guy so indeed you did call out the headwinds the possibility of headwinds in the uk obviously there may be still one or two rate hikes for which we will be passing most of that to customers through passthrough rates and we do see continued headwinds in hong kong with around per month migration into term deposit with the mix now at term deposits across both our entities in hong kong this being said we also have tailwinds the first one is we still have a strong momentum from  which were carrying over the second tailwind is hibor normalization i mean just for reference in hong kong hibor and exchange fund bills rates in  were basis point and basis point lower on average than where they were in  and that was a major headwind for us in  we are seeing now over the last few weeks we have been seeing normalization in those rates if we continue to see normalization and just for the reminder were about basis points off their equivalent rate in dollars if we continue to see normalization this will provide us material tailwinds in the hong kong base and the other tailwind is our resilient deposit and loan base we continue having stable deposits and loans despite some of the competitive pressures and we continue to aim for midsingledigit growth in both in the medium term which should give us some supportive tailwinds noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02may2023 so just to reinforce what we said at the full year results in february we said we noted the guidance that was in existence when we reported in february and we said we were not uncomfortable sorry with the consensus that we noted the consensus that was in existence in february and we said we were not uncomfortable with where consensus was we still have that view the only adjustment you need to make to nii is for the ifrs adjustment everything else remains as we said in february that the guidance that existed at that point in time we were not uncomfortable with it the same is true today just adjust for ifrs which is around about a billion adjustment from ifrs to ifrs thats the only change that needs to be made based on what weve given you as an update today and then on svb we acquired sorry we recruited over people in the us to build out our svb capability in the us we did not bring a book with them purchase a book so they will be in buildout mode so there will be a payback period on that investment we think its a relatively short payback period based on the quality of people weve hired were looking at other geographies around the world we think its a sensible and modest investment to do that organically and were pretty confident on the payback well be relatively sure well provide more details once we complete our buildout hopefully by the half year well be able to give you more information so there will be a profit drag to a degree probably in the first year months but then i think it will be back into profit territory even on those organic buildout strategies but well give more of an update at the half year i think strategically its absolutely the right thing to do for the medium term this is a sector of the economy that is critical for all geographies and has huge growth potential on revenue thank you next question please operator thank you the next question comes from rob noble with deutsche bank your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc hi rob robert noble q analyst deutsche bank ag uk hi there most of my questions have been asked if you just flip out the lcr its relatively low in a european context obviously your deposit base is a different kind of structure so are you happy ramping with that level in the medium term with the uncertainty in the market and how do you expect regulation or approach to liquidity to change given whats happened in the us thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc georges do you want to handle that georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc sure thank you rob so we dont target lcr we are continuing to target medium term single to middigit loan growth in our portfolio and we obviously continue to cherish deposits and attract and continue wanting to attract deposits the lcr would be an outcome i think insofar that we look at our liquidity management its the high quality liquid assets ratio that we look at its the cash and cash equivalent within it that we look at and in terms of loans again if the short term is somewhat subdued in particular in hong kong in the medium term some of the hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02may2023 bounce back and some of the trade bounce back that were seeing as well may support that loan growth ambition in the medium term noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc and i think on the regulation impacts i think we have to wait and see what the various regulators around the world do on regulation but i think the way i look at it the primary responsibility for running a prudent balance sheet is on the management and the board of a financial institution thats a responsibility weve taken seriously throughout our history our high quality liquid assets has been a feature of our heritage our highquality cash and cash equivalents has been a feature of our heritage for many decades so we put the primary responsibility on liquidity management on ourselves and then well see what the regulatory environment does as a consequence of some of the recent changes but thank you next question operator next question is from aman rakkar with barclays your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc aman hi aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd good morning noel hey good morning noel good morning georges i just need to come back to revenues both your net interest income and your noninterest income are performing really well in  and they are annualizing at levels that would suggest pretty material upside to market expectations for both of those lines your net interest income is annualizing north of billion on the  number youve guided obviously greater than billion i appreciate theres lots of moving parts there but i guess to be more specific noel in terms of your commentary around consensus of full year now theres a kind of billion gap between where the street is and what youre guiding for streets with billion it doesnt actually sound like you see much downside to that consensus number at billion unless theres something here around term deposit mix or it feels like theres a lot of conservatism in the nii guidance or theres something im missing so can you help us with that and then secondly on the noninterest income i totally appreciate your markets business might have overrun in  but you are also pointing towards the wealth management business thats trending higher an underlying momentum in your fee business as you talked about strategic initiatives at full year that sit behind that so like to what extent is that revenue number an overrun or is this the kind of level that we can expect you to crank out in the year because this is well ahead of where the street is any color you can give us there would be really helpful thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc aman two good questions and let me just clarify what i said about what we said in february i think youre right on your math so i think if you go back to what we said in february that was we talked about 36billionplus and when people were talking about our nii that was sort of annualized and its for about billion and the consensus was around billion to billion hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02may2023 and i think we said we were comfortable with that so i think if you go back to then we sort of said yes were sort of comfortable consensus had a calculation on the plus bit of the billion that put it sort of north of billion that was around about consensus back then and all im saying to you now is the only thing you need to adjust for is ifrs which takes about billion off of that so were talking about 34billionplus and that therefore would put you north of billion so i think what were saying is that should were sort of saying the street has probably got nii around about the right place back in february of last year and were saying theres no need to change what the street is you only got to do the mechanical adjustment for ifrs hopefully that helps and then georges i think do you want to just come back on the nonnii because i think youre right theres elements of our nonnii performance in  that georges is saying annualized theres just some elements that are saying it may be unwise to analyze them fully for some of the trading income but georges do you just want to reclarify what you said georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc sure noel so aman if i kind of unpack the nonnii some of the outperformance that weve seen with regards funding of the trading book where weve seen billion this quarter against billion quarter one last year because rates were at zero but against billion quarter four so somewhat flat to just slightly up from quarter four that number is it is fair to annualize it given current rate forecast consensus equally as noel mentioned earlier the discussion on wealth the growth in nnia in wealth the resumption of activity in hong kong in particular bodes well for the future and i think it is fair to assume that we will see continued performance in wealth on the other hand some of the outperformance in some of the markets activities such as foreign exchange trading which had a record quarter may not be repeated and obviously we will have to look at it quarterby quarter in terms of what business opportunities are there and what you can bake in and factor in the results the  outperformance i would caution you not to annualize that outperformance but in general aman if i take a step back it is a good set of results and we are confident about the future and in light of the strong  performance we will have to review and we will review the guidance in h1 noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc okay thank you aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd thank you so much noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc next question please operator that comes from martin leitgeb with goldman sachs your line is open why is hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02may2023 noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc martin hi martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international yes good morning noel and georges first of all congratulations for this good set of results noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international i just have one broader question on growth and one followup on deposits please and im just looking at a much improved profitability levels of the group with indiscernible being around billion to billion higher of the quarter despite capacity to scale up growth and i was just wondering if we look into the medium term or starting do you see the ph goal for the group to lean more into growth indiscernible single digits loan growth could potentially be higher or should we just think that any increase in profitability could be potentially returned to shareholders just in terms of the tradeoff between opportunity for growing more versus shareholder return and secondly with regards to the deposit franchise i was just wondering if you could comment on the strength of hsbc deposit franchise during the quarter have you seen in particular inflows in certain parts of your footprint helping delivering that stable deposit ph strength in the quarter and i was also wondering with regard to deposit migration indiscernible whether you have seen there any change in trend if are we towards the end of that cycle in terms of deposit migration or could it still go on for a number of quarters thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc okay just a couple of comments one comment from me on growth listen i think clearly we want to pursue growth but i think we have the capacity in our dividend payout ratio of to pursue growth and with the option of doing buybacks as well now at the moment i think weve seen a relatively subdued lending market in corporate banking i think the demand for term loans around the world is not particularly high at the moment and probably isnt going to be particularly high in the very near term as georges said earlier i mean once we get to one would expect there to be an increase in demand starting to emerge but for the near term for the next few months in given the economic uncertainty were seeing subdued loan demand so i mean the message id give you in a payout ratio world we believe the second after we pay the dividends there is potential to fund both growth and buybacks and thats our plans going forward georges do you want to just cover the deposit trend the inflows the outflows and deposit migration georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02may2023 sure martin so yeah i mean if i start with some of the outflows that were seeing and then i go into the tailwind some of the outflows were seeing particularly in the uk so obviously uk retail  is a tax payment period so theres seasonality here we are still seeing high cost of living resilient inflation in the uk which is obviously draining some of the uk consumers savings to a lesser extent competitive pressure as well in the uk likewise for corporates in the uk  was a yearend where people showed up their liquidity whereas  most of the companies pay dividend and then you can see some of the draining liquidity were also seeing deleveraging of loans using some of the deposits to deleverage on the loan side especially for those with a strong rate differential between what theyre paying on their loans this being said we continue to see growth and strength in the deposit proposition so if i take hong kong and all of asia actually were seeing definite deposit growth in the retail and the personal banking space we have seen growth of our deposit base in commercial banking in the us so we were one of the beneficiary banks of the deposit migration from mediumsized banks into large banks and we obviously continue to cherish our propositions in deposits to continue attracting deposits at the right price noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc okay thank you martin next question please operator thank you we will take our last question today from tom rayner with numis your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc hi tom tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd yes thank you hi there good morning guys two please first one noel just on the loan growth i mean you flagged the corporate demand and maybe that is the answer i just kind of ask could you quite update on the economic recovery youre seeing now in hong kong and china or in the uk i think you said those quite resilient so is there any other reason why youre sort of cautious in the short term on loan growth or is it purely a lack of demand from some corporates and well a second question on cost please noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc okay whats your question on costs georges do you want to yeah tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd yeah i mean really its the sort of looking at the target for this year and thinking forward to next year because i guess youre still enjoying some of the flow through this year from cost savings from the previous cost program which has now ended so i just wondered if georges would comment on sort of approach towards costs in whether youll be thinking in terms of an absolute growth maybe similar to this year or whether a jaws approach might be more appropriate i dont know if theres anything any color you could add for next year thank you hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02may2023 noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah thanks thanks tom just on loan growth listen i think your points are fair one i think if there is a place where i think loan growth could pick up more in the near term i think it would be asia i think middle east is another option so i think i am being a bit cautious on the nearterm loan growth i think probably it will start to emerge more in the working capital side of the balance sheet trade finance before people start investing in fixed capital but i think there is a level of nervousness out there in the corporate world about taking longterm investment decisions in fixed capital that is aside from sustainability i think theres a lot of infrastructure spend taking place and i could see some loan growth coming in and around that sustainable infrastructure investment so maybe i am being a bit cautious on loan growth at the moment i think id rather be that way in the near term but i dont think i do believe this is going to be mediumterm loan growth i think its fair to say that asia has the potential to pick up faster than elsewhere in the world so yeah i think it may be fair that im being a bit cautious georges elhedery a chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc if i kind of just adding to noels comments tom if you look at hong kong in the retail space both cards and mortgages have been growing in the first quarter even in the uk we are seeing green shoots in the mortgage sector i mean our market share in the mortgage sector in the uk for the first two month of the year is at thats for new business thats against the book market share of about and the  new business market share of so were certainly there in the retail space where were seeing growth on the wholesale side i just want to add one comment to noels description which is also bear in mind the rate differential between china and hong kong so all those chinese companies who used to use hong kong as a base for raising funding internationally will be less doing so as long as the rate differential between dollar rates and onshore china rates are that wide it is cheaper for these corporates to raise funding in mainland china as opposed to hong kong and that will remain the case up until the time we see a reversal in that rate trend if i move to your second question tom we have not shared targets for as yet but the few guiding principles i can share with you the first guiding principle paramount guiding principle is that you should expect our focus on cost discipline to continue the second guiding principle is that we will continue doing transformation and restructuring as part of our bau cost base and expect some of those saves to flow through also into and beyond and case in point is the spend on severance which were planning now to do in  this year for which the benefit will flow through mostly into and thirdly at this stage were still looking to guide towards dollar cost number as opposed to jaws in the way we will be looking at as we come to be able to give you additional guidance later in the year tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd okay thank you very much noel quinn group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 02may2023 so thank you all for your questions really appreciate you taking the time to close our first quarter results i just want to say that the first quarter results provide further evidence that our strategy is working we had a strong first quarter profit performance cost discipline remained tight and were clearly on track to deliver our roce target weve resumed quarterly dividends and announced a share buyback of up to billion but im also confident about the rest of we built a strong platform for future growth and our geographical footprint puts us in areas of high growth i look forward to speaking with you soon have a good morning or afternoon thank you operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes the call for hsbc holdings plc  results you may now disconnect disclaimer the
