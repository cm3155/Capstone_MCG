management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the investor and analyst conference call for hsbc holdings plcs earnings release for for your information this conference is being recorded at this time i will hand the call over to your host mr noel quinn group chief executive noel quinn group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you good morning or afternoon wherever you are ewen is going to take the bulk of the call today and he will do that in future  and  announcements for today though let me start by saying that im really pleased with our third quarter performance weve had a strong quarter of profit generation across all regions supported by another quarter of net ecl releases but most pleasing is the underlying revenue growth were now seeing across the business we feel that were turning the corner on revenue after absorbing interest rate impacts over the last few quarters weve got strong fee growth in all businesses audio gap in global banking and markets revenue is starting to stabilize and thats against the backdrop of a large managed reduction in riskweighted assets and lending balances as we indicated back in february in terms of customer behavior were seeing a strong deposit performance without any material drawdown on the liquidity that weve built up over the last two years the lending market was softer than we anticipated in the quarter particularly in corporate loans but the pipelines that we built up position us well for when companies start investing in both the recovery and the low carbon transition on capital as our revenue starts to normalize weve also looked to normalize our capital position capital returns to shareholders will be a big component of this and im pleased to announce a share buyback of billion which we expect to start shortly on our strategy were executing with exactly the kind of pace i promised in february weve made some important announcements in the quarter including the acquisition of axa singapore this complements our existing singapore business very well and accelerates the buildout of our product and distribution capabilities in one of the worlds most important wealth markets precop26 weve been working incredibly hard with clients governments and our industry peers on accelerating the low carbon transition were working with a range of partners to find new ways to open the sustainable finance market for projects and investors a fortnight ago we announced a pioneering partnership with temasek to create the debt financing platform for sustainable infrastructure in southeast asia which i believe provides an important model for others to follow this is just one of a number of sustainability partnerships that we hope to announce in the coming weeks and i look forward to updating you on those shortly in terms of the financial industrys contribution the task force of international banks that ive been privileged to chair over the recent months just released a guide for banks on setting and delivering net zero targets this is an unprecedented collaboration that makes an important contribution to help all banks operationalize the targets theyve set and importantly to bring consistency and coherence for our customers regulators and investors im really excited about the months ahead theres real dynamism and optimism within the business and were focused on delivering growth in the areas weve targeted with the added benefit of interest rate rises on the horizon were in a strong position moving into hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2021 with that ill hand over to ewen to take you through the detail ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks noel and good morning or afternoon all we had another good quarter reported pretax profits of billion up on last years third quarter with an annualized return on tangible equity of for the year to date adjusted revenues were down on last years third quarter but up excluding certain volatile items with a welcome return to more consistent top line growth across most of our business lines expected credit losses were a million net release by third quarter in a row of net releases with net releases for the year to date of some billion we still retain of stage and stage ecl reserve buildout we made in operating expenses were broadly stable increases in investment and technology spend were offset by the impact of our cost saving initiatives but due to some inflationary pressures ongoing investment into growth and additional costs due to the impact and timing of recently announced ma activity we now expect our adjusted costs for and to remain broadly stable at around billion excluding the uk bank levy lending balances were down by billion or this was due to the repayment of billion of shortterm ipo lending in hong kong stripping out the impact of the ipo loans lending grew by billion or annualized during the quarter with further good growth in mortgage lending and trade finance our core tier ratio was up basis points at primarily due to a reduction in riskweighted assets we now intend to reach our target for core tier of to by the end of this will reflect a combination of some regulatorydriven rwa impacts balance sheet growth and capital return todays billion buyback announcement is part of this commitment to accelerate the normalization of our core tier position our tangible net asset value per share of was unchanged on the second quarter turning to slide were seeing good signs of growth returning across our global businesses in wealth and personal banking weve continued to grow asian net new money in private banking and asset management weve increased the value of new business and insurance by yearonyear weve hired new wealth planners in pinnacle our new chinese insurance venture weve kept our uk flow market share comfortably above our stock share and weve made good progress on new customer acquisition in commercial banking were seeing encouraging trends in global trade with good market share growth in key markets such as hong kong and singapore and weve maintained a strong business pipeline with billion of new approved limits in global banking and markets we saw more stable revenue compared to a strong performance in the third quarter last year with good revenue growth in both security services and equities and gbms performance was achieved despite a reduction in riskweighted assets year on year looking geographically in asia were seeing strong underlying revenue trends excluding insurance market impacts revenues were up quarteron quarter and yearonyear and in the uk ringfenced bank revenues were up quarteronquarter and yearonyear with fee income up over the third quarter last year finally and importantly were delivering on our goal to be a leader in the transition to net zero we have issue billion of green bonds yeartodate including leading on a number of pioneering green bond offerings such as the first uk green gilt and were making good progress against the commitments we made in our agm special resolution in may hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2021 turning to slide and looking at third quarter adjusted revenues as a whole in wealth and personal banking headline revenues were down on a year ago but excluding insurance market impacts wealth management revenues grew by million or this was mainly due to higher fee income in asset management and private banking together with insurance sales growth personal banking revenues fell by million due to the continuing impact of low interest rates on deposit margins commercial banking revenues were higher driven by higher fee income across all products and growth in trade lending and deposit balances in global banking and markets revenues were down 3this was due to slower customer activity in fixed income markets versus a strong third quarter last year however equities benefited from both higher client activity and volatility in asia and security services grew through higher fee income and assets under custody slide shows the revenue trend quarteronquarter with growth in all three global businesses excluding insurance market impacts this has been driven by a combination of more stable net interest income together with good fee income growth across all our businesses up yearonyear we are increasingly confident that were turning the corner on revenue growth commercial banking is growing wealth and personal banking is growing in wealth management and stabilizing in retail banking and global banking and markets is close to that inflection point now that the bulk of its planned rwa reductions in the business are now complete with the expectation of policy rates from onwards were now confident in seeing sustained revenue growth this coming year and beyond which together with strong cost control will help drive a sustained improvement in core returns and operating jaws on slide net interest income was billion up against the third quarter of on a reported basis and broadly stable compared with the second quarter of on rates the net interest margin was basis points down basis point on the second quarter primarily reflecting changes in balance sheet mix and continued weakness in ibor lending volumes were down on the quarter but excluding the repayment of ipo loans lending grew by billion with continued good loan growth in mortgages in hong kong and the uk together with the ongoing growth in our global trade franchise for with our net interest margin stabilizing policy rate rises on the horizon and loan growth building were increasingly confident on the outlook for net interest income on the next slide we reported a net release of million of ecls in the quarter compared with an million charge in the third quarter of the net release was across all our global businesses reflecting a more stable economic outlook together with stage charges that remained very low despite the net releases we continue to retain a conservative outlook on risk we still hold billion or of our covid19 uplift to stage and ecl reserves for the full year we now expect net releases to be broadly in line with the net release in the first nine months with perhaps a very modest net release in the fourth quarter after stage charges for we continue to expect the ecl charge for the full year to be lower than our mediumterm throughthecycle planning range of to basis points with more modest ecl releases expected to continue into the first half of albeit with an expected net charge after stage impairments turning to slide third quarter adjusted operating costs were broadly stable on the same period of last year a million increase in technology spending and a million increase in investment and other costs were offset by a further million of cost program savings compared with the prior year with an associated cost to achieve of million hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2021 to date our cost programs have achieved savings of billion relative to our end target of at least billion in cost savings and cumulative cost to achieve spend to date has been billion with an intention to still spend billion through the end of in terms of outlook with some inflationary and performancerelated pay pressures ongoing investment spend and additional cost due to the impact and timing of recently announced acquisitions and disposals we now expect and adjusted costs excluding the uk bank levy to be around billion this is relative to our previous fx adjusted guidance of billion for which included the bank levy turning to capital on slide our core tier ratio was up basis points in the quarter this reflected a decrease in risk weighted assets from lower shortterm lending favorable asset quality movements and fx partially offset by a decrease in cet1 including around billion for foreseeable dividends excluding fx movements riskweighted assets fell by billion in the third quarter driven by lower shortterm ipo loan exposures in hong kong and positive movements in asset quality in the third quarter we made a regulatory deduction of basis points for all foreseeable dividends in the quarter this was based on of our third quarter eps of which is the midpoint of our to target payout ratio the dividend accrual for so far is billion after payment of the per share interim dividend please remember that this is not guidance of our fullyear dividend intentions the dividend accrual is purely a formulaic calculation that ph will true up at the full year based upon the results and outlook at the time when thinking about the payout ratio for well attach a much lower weight to unusually low ecls as part of our eps this year together with a desire to see higher dividends per share in relative to 2021we intend to normalize our core tier ratio over the coming quarters to be back within our to target range by the end of driven by a combination of balance sheet growth capital returns and regulatory impacts various things to note for your capital modeling through the end of we expect todays buyback announcement the loss on sale of our french retail banking operations and the reversal of the current software capitalization benefit to each impact our core tier ratio by around basis points and we also expect some billion to billion of regulatory durée on rwa uplifts in so in summary this was another good quarter good earnings diversity across the group a broadbased return to top line growth in most of our businesses and continued strong control on costs while the results were flatted by net ecl releases were happy to be turning the corner on revenue with robust lending platforms growth in trade and mortgage balances and the likelihood of really a pipeline rate rises than previously anticipated were increasingly confident on the revenue growth outlook for weve included a few ifrs slides in the appendix we intend to go through this in more detail on our followup call on wednesday for sellside analysts overall we expect an initial downside adjustment to our insurance profits of around twothirds and a smaller percentage adjustment to insurances tangible equity importantly there will be no significant impact on the groups regulatory capital and therell be no impact on the dividend flows from our insurance businesses to the group despite inflationary cost pressures and the impact of ifrs implementation we remain confident in achieving returns at or above our cost of capital over the next three years together with delivering attractive growth and attractive capital returns finally were looking to normalize our core tier ratio over the coming quarters of which todays buyback announcement is an important first step hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2021 with that sharon if we could please open up for questions question and answer section operator thank you mr stevenson operator instructions your first question today comes from the line of andrew coombs from citi please go ahead your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hi andy andrew coombs q analyst citigroup global markets ltd morning thanks for taking the questions start with one on the buybacks and then one on costs so when you come out and quantify the billion plus buyback can you just go to the metrics that youre using to size that how youre thinking about this buyback through say buybacks going forward and basically the kpis in your decision making process on the magnitude of those so that will be the first question the second question is on the cost outlook where youve slightly changed your guidance and also the definition youre using i think ph based on your old guidance is thats one in the half and then adjusting to the levy it looks like youve taken out the cost guidance by about million so can you just give a breakdown of what the moving parts are in the increase how much of it is due to the timing around the ma and divestments versus how much is inflationary pressures and how much is higher compensation related to performancerelated pay thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so back on on buybacks andy as you would expect its indiscernible yeah we our capital position is obviously in a much better place than we had anticipated at the start of the year when we had said no buybacks for this year weve had a combination of much higher profitability than we expected because of lower much lower ecls net releases and ph slower cost to achieve being expensed through the pl and risk weighted assets have also been lower than we anticipated partly because of lower growth but also because of lower credit rating migration i think within todays announcement is a commitment to get back to to by the end of yeah we are committed to using excess capital if we cant find attractive organic and inorganic growth opportunities we previously talked on inorganic about wanting to spend up to billion in ma weve announced a deal in singapore axa singapore for just over million so that will give you some color of the extent of ma activity that you might see over the next year or so i do think that we are likely to see if we achieve what we think well achieve next year some further buyback activity in on costs yeah i think your numbers are broadly right if you add about million for ma ph in terms of sort of roughly billion and upwards pure cost the bulk of that is compensation related and youre right part of it is variable pay but i would sort of put it all in the bucket of compensation cost being higher broadly our total wage bill is about billion out of the billion of total costs yeah so if youve got billion of hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2021 incremental inflation on that its about two its about billion so about billion of extra compensation cost yeah whether you put it into fixed pay or variable pay i think we are seeing sustained wage price pressure globally at the moment but in terms of the incremental amount that weve put into the variable pay pool this year its significantly more than offset by the increase in profitability that weve seen noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc i think if i could just add a comment there to the extent that weve topped up variable pay its probably because weve had a good trading performance this year and clearly weve given some indications on our view of trading performance next year being positive and it would be right to have an appropriate level of variable pay at that point in time in the event that that trading performance actually does materialize then we have some flexibility on the variable pay but its right to also signal that there is some fixed pay inflation pressures in the market generally within financial services at this point in time so the extra top up on costs is a combination of fixed pay and variable pay as a consequence of the external environment and the trading performance of the bank ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah and i think the last thing noel also thats important is weve made a very conscious decision not to cut back on investment despite that inflationary pressure in order to meet a selfimposed cost target andrew coombs q analyst citigroup global markets ltd thats great thank you both and also thank you indiscernible the slides on ifrs as well thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of tom rayner from numis please go ahead your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hi tom tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd yes good thank you hi there noel hi ewen two please just a quick followup on costs and then one on revenue you mentioned ewen about million of the increased guidance is ma related can you give us a sort of estimate of how much that ma activity might add to the revenue over the sort of next two to three years just to get a sense and then just on revenue youre clearly more positive on the revenue outlook and youve flagged a number of areas you didnt really comment i dont think on the outlook for the net interest margin i look at your consensus and it only has an increase from  right out to the end of say of about basis points and if i just take your own rate sensitivity and sort of multiply it by whats in being discounted by the market it will obviously be a multiple of basis points i wonder if you could comment on the outlook for nim specifically please thank you hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2021 ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks so on costs look in the near term i think axa singapore will add about million to revenues and million to costs obviously we would expect that picture to move over time but if you plug in million into on the revenue side on nim indiscernible forecast but if you looked at current consensus if you yeah it does look low relative to the consensus policy rate rises that you now see in the markets just as a reminder our biggest single sensitivity is the uk where a 25basispoint rise would add about billion of income in the first year and secondly hong kong and it does look like in the uk we will see two three rate rises between now and the end of coming potentially as early as the next month or so hong kong may be a bit slower but one of the offsets to clear offsets to the guidance were giving on cost today is the fact that we do think were going to see earlier and stronger rate rises than we previously anticipated we lost about billion over the last year two years or so as a result of the shift down on interest rates so its had a very very material impact on us and we do think with the policy rate outlook at the moment and consensus that we should start to claw back a meaningful amount of that in the next two to three years tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd indiscernible okay thank you very much operator thank you your next question comes from the line of raul sinha from jpmorgan please go ahead your line is open raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc thank you morning afternoon noel ewen couple of questions from my side maybe firstly just staying on the revenue line i just wanted to understand the pandemic impacts thats still washing through your various businesses and sort of holding back your revenue line so i was wondering if you could comment on the wealth business in hong kong with in light of all the travel restrictions how you think the performance in this quarter has been held back and how that might shift over the next year or so and also in trade obviously you flagged a very strong improvement in trade balances there is a lot of uncertainty around clearly whats happening in global trade so any thoughts on the outlook that would be helpful and then just a broader second question on china real estate thank you for the disclosure i think we all get sort of your first order impacts and exposures are relatively limited but i was wondering what you think about the second order impacts on your business in the mainland just given defaults have spread beyond sort of single name into quite a few developers now so how do you see that impacting the rest of your book and the rest of your business indiscernible ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so maybe ill start off and then noel you can add some comments then on trade and commercial real estate after i finish look on hong kong and the border being shut the i mean you can see some direct impacts on things like insurance franchise were not as exposed obviously to others like pru and aia to the hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2021 mainland chinese insurance market but it is a meaningful kicker to the performance of our insurance franchise in hong kong having said that i think the value of new business in  was in line with  prepandemic you can see certain sectors in hong kong continuing to suffer yeah the biggest border is the hong kong mainland china border rather than the international border for hong kong given the prepandemic about million mainland chinese were visiting hong kong in any given year so we would expect as that border progressively reopens and its been much slower than we would have anticipated six or nine months ago that we will just see an incremental benefit coming through to the hong kong business on trade despite supply chain disruptions i think were pretty pleased with the recovery that were seeing in that business people are holding higher working capital balances at the moment consistent with the uncertainty that exists in the supply chains but yeah we do view that as a temporary feature of the global economy at the moment and that we will get back to more normality and more sustained growth in on the china real estate market i mean weve just been through as you would expect a pretty intensive review of our chinese real estate exposure including the provisioning we brought against it just to repeat what we said today weve got no direct exposure to redlist borrowers were pretty comfortable with the exposure overall in aggregate commercial real estate our commercial real estate in china is less than billion in the context of a trillion loan portfolio and i think the other thing you should read in raul is the fact that were doing a buyback today and the size that were doing it is that were reasonably confident about where were sitting in terms of our outlook but noel i dont know whether you want to add anything or noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc just ironically on trade theres a feature the more uncertain global economics are is normally the time when trade finance is in demand because of uncertainty over the supply chain uncertainty over credit environment so weve seen strong growth in trade balances part of that is a function of economic rebound part of that i think is a function of working capital cycles are longer today than they were precovid and prepandemic because of the tensions in the supply chain and the bottlenecks and part of that is people tend to use documentary credit more in uncertain times than open account and therefore they turn more to the financial services sector to finance trade in a structured manner rather than financing trade in an unstructured open account methodology so i think theres a number of reasons and then the fourth ingredient is frankly we are taking market share in trade in asia in particular particularly in hong kong and singapore so those four dynamics i think are leading to very strong doubledigit growth in trade and i think if you look at our trade balances from the end of last year to the end of september were up around about if you do a yearonyear comparison september to september i think we maybe mid20 growth in trade particularly in asia so its those four factors i think are playing into the trade performance and on china the only other comment id make is look there is second order risk in whenever theres a market adjustment of that size taking place in a particular industry sector and particularly one as important as commercial real estate i think were pretty comfortable with our position and were staying very close to any potential second order risks but ill reinforce what ewen said we feel comfortable with our position in our bank in china its performing well its had a good nine months and were well positioned on commercial real estate from a primary risk point of view and we think were wellpositioned on any second order risk but id be foolish if i said there was no second order risk it potentially exists for all of us hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2021 raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc thank you noel can i just follow up on the trade margin i dont know if youve seen a sort of shift in the trade margin within the business and if you expect that to shift going forward given what were seeing in terms of the global trade picture thanks noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc im not aware of any material shift in the margin its more of a volume game at the moment but ewen is that your understanding ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah look if anything i think it just ticked up by a few basis points but nothing material raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc thanks very much operator thank you your next question comes from the line of manus costello from autonomous please go ahead your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hi manus manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp hi i just wanted to follow up actually on those questions about the hopefully postpandemic reopening you gave us some data in the second quarter about credit card balances growing but i havent seen it so far this quarter i wonder if you could talk to us about what youre seeing in unsecured and you mentioned within the nim that there was a negative mix shift which hurt the nim at what point will that mix shift change so as unsecured consumer starts to grow presumably youd start to see a positive benefit any color you could provide around that will be appreciated thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah ph i mean firstly on nim two things were going on i think to sort of push it down by basis point in the quarter firstly was hibor drifted down by a couple of basis points over the quarter we do hope were now at the trough of that and there is a mix shift with both the higher propensity of mortgage lower spread mortgage lending and the fact that were continuing to increase our liquidity reserves at the moment yeah the unsecured was probably up about billion underlying in the quarter for both across hong kong and uk and about half and half across the two markets yeah what we are seeing is credit card spending come back hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2021 up closer to the prepandemic levels but what were not seeing yet are the balances go up in line with that i think that will yeah should happen over time but at the moment whether its commercial customers or personal customers were seeing the same thing in uk mortgages for example people are paying down debt when they can and i think thats just a sign of confidence at the moment that we would expect to continue to improve as we continue to move away from the depths of covid manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp okay thank you very much operator thank you your next question comes from the line of ya fei tian from citigroup please go ahead your line is open ya fei tian q analyst citigroup global markets asia ltd thank you i have a question around revenue you give us color thats quite a lot of the optimism is coming from the higher expected interest rate in some of your markets besides that interest rate shift are there any organic growth that hsbc is gaining market share that you think that ph were the sell side is missing that could drive more consensus revenue upgrades and some noninterest income thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah i mean to be clear were not reliant on interest rate rises to underpin the business plan that weve got the were seeing with nim stabilizing were probably going to see about loan growth this year we would expect midsingledigit loan growth next year so you would expect a healthy increase in net interest income next year with or without rate rises were seeing very good growth in fee income as we come out of covid i think its up yearonyear so yeah the core business at the moment is seeing very good attractive growth interest rate rises will just come on top of that and in terms of where were growing look noel said earlier were taking share in trade were up a couple of percentage points of share over the last year both in hong kong and singapore were continuing to grow uk mortgage share above stock share i think we were sort of about ahead of stock share in the quarter yeah were growing the private bank i think ahead of peers particularly credit suisse in asia at the moment so yeah most of our businesses i think are flat to gaining share ya fei tian q analyst citigroup global markets asia ltd thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of guy stebbings from exane bnp please go ahead your line is open guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2021 hi good morning thanks for taking questions the first one was back on costs and one on rwa so on costs and ewen you briefly alluded for the previous question the link with the interest rate outlook i mean how much is the new guidance intertwined with market inflation and interest rate expectations or to put it another way policy rates dont move higher in line with market expectations should we expect you to come in lower than that guidance and then the second question on rwas consensus is nearly billion higher by the end of next year than where we sit today appreciate there are some regulatory headwinds on the horizon that you flagged and youve now delivered a majority of the gross rwas as youve guided to by the end of next year but the market rwa expectations i guess billion or billion next year look a little too conservative given the starting point and what youre seeing currently in terms of lack of credit migration thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah look on cost yeah they are connected but not a direct line between the inflationary pressure that were seeing coming through the cost structure and the fact that we expect to see earlier policy rate rises to give everyone assurance we are actively managing our cost base in line with what we previously thought were still committed to taking out billion of costs over the period to the end of and weve done just over half of that so far but on a billion wage bill look if you see each percentage point is another million of cost relative to where we were at the start of the year were definitely seeing more inflation the offset for that should be policy rate rises coming earlier and stronger and if they do that will comfortably offset the inflationary pressure were seeing on costs but we are not going soft on costs just because we think that there is a potential of rate rises thats not how were operating the business on rwas i mean i think weve given you pretty much all of the inputs to model i guess were more confident on the rwa growth outlook for lending growth outlook for next year than i think is currently in consensus weve got it to midsingledigit loan growth the other thing that weve given you the impacts on regulatory capital you can plug in your own numbers in terms of weve given you our distribution policy on dividends so the only things that you dont have is where the profitability is going to be next year what buybacks were going to do and even on inorganic weve tried to give you a steer as to what the total quantum of financial inorganic that we might do as well guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas okay thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of omar keenan from credit suisse please go ahead your line is open omar keenan q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd good morning thank you very much for taking the questions ive got a few questions on rate sensitivity please i was hoping if you could give some color around deposit betas in your rate sensitivity disclosure especially for the uk and hong kong given one of your peers reassessed the uk rate sensitivity based on a sort of more realistic assumption of what deposit betas are likely to be and any color that you can give on the proportion of deposits contractually linked to market rates in both those markets would be very helpful hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2021 and the second part of my question on rate sensitivity is the other currencies figure of billion could you perhaps just elaborate a little bit more about what the key sensitivities in terms of different currencies are there because its about as big as the hong kong sensitivity thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yes look on rate sensitivity i think you should have seen for the first one or two interest rate rises that we have relatively low deposit beta on that and that we will try to capture higher than average capture out of those rate rises and i think over the longer term typically we work on the basis of about a to deposit beta but in the very very short term with the first rate rise i think it will be much lower than that in terms of other currencies indian rupee renminbi various emerging market currencies of which mexico is important im sure if you follow up with the ir team they can give you a fuller breakdown of that omar keenan q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd thats wonderful thanks and could i just check the published sensitivity is that based on ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah well it differs by product by market but roughly yes omar keenan q analyst credit suisse securities europe ltd okay thank you very much operator thank you your next question comes from the line of aman rakkar from barclays please go ahead your line is open aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd good morning most of my questions have been asked actually but a couple of points of clarification so thanks very much for the ifrs disclosure on the insurance business in terms of the twothirds pbt impact that you kind of expect in i mean i guess that insurance profit that we would be making profit that adjustment to are we talking is it around a kind of billion hit that we should be looking for kind of reported pbt in any clarification there would be really helpful and then just a second on the cost to achieve i know you are sticking with the guidance there at billion but it does imply that youre going to do a lot next year i mean could you help us understand exactly why youve not been able to spend it so far and kind of what you are going to be doing next year with that ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc okay so on pbt impacts well billion it obviously depends what your forecast is but if thats twothirds of the insurance profits in that year then yes its probably not wildly out of line with what we think but just again just to repeat on ifrs theres no impact on dividend flow from the insurance companies to the group theres hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2021 no impact on group core tier the timing of earnings recognition has changed so fundamental economics we dont think has changed the other thing on tangible equity just because i know a few people have been flying around with numbers today we think therell be about a billion plus or minus impact to tangible equity as there was a shift and that audio gap then will be negative but minimal and its still tied in with our commitment to get back to cost of capital returns on cta i think well think well probably spend about another billion or so in  which leaves us about billion or so to spend in we did have a slower delivery this year a big part of that was a lot of our change programs are being run in india and they obviously had a pretty severe impact as a result of the pandemic which meant that our hiring plans particularly technology resources that we intended to bring onboard had been slower so theres been about a threeplusmonth delay to some major programs of work and its one of the reasons why as a result of that we expect costs to tick up in  because weve got this ramp up in investment coming into  aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd thats great thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of rob noble from deutsche bank please go ahead your line is open robert noble q analyst deutsche bank ag good morning all could you talk us through how interest rates are actually hedged in the various markets maybe just the uk hong kong and us and then so will they actually see ph what sort of rates its in do you actually ph need the short rates to go up in all of those countries or you benefit from higher rates in the market in some and not others and then secondly just on the uk where do you see your front book mortgage margins are at the moment and in comparison to where they were where they are on the back book and what do you think recent swaps the increase in swaps are they pushing rates up in the market in the uk now thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc so on the hedging program hong kong is very short dated everything reprices typically in one to three months the uk there is a fiveyear rolling hedge that we have in place consistent with most uk peers i think with an average duration then of about twoandahalf years the us is slightly longer than the five years albeit i think that will change once we divest ourselves out of the retail banking business and its not as material obviously as hong kong and uk if you look at the structure of our assets and liabilities they do tend to be much more shortdated than the average peer which is a combination of the impact of a shortdated nature of hong kong but also on the commercial space our trade business is relatively shortdated as well so the second question was richard the second question hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2021 robert noble q analyst deutsche bank ag sorry it was on front book mortgage margins versus back book and whether you think swap spreads will cause increase in rates ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah front book margins are probably slightly below back book margins currently for the first time in quite a while we have seen some margin pressure coming through the uk mortgage franchise we do still think at current rates that were writing business comfortably above the cost of capital but there has been some margin contraction robert noble q analyst deutsche bank ag okay thanks very much operator thank you your next question comes from the line of ed firth from kbw please go ahead your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hi ed edward firth q analyst keefe bruyette woods yeah good morning everybody sorry to go on about this interest rate sensitivity but i guess it is quite crucial in terms of the outlook but the bit i dont really understand is when i look at the currencies if i look at your year one sensitivity your sterling sensitivity is materially higher than your hong kong sensitivity and yet your sterling is the bit thats hedged the hong kong isnt and yet the total balances in hong kong are well orders of magnitude similar but i guess indiscernible slightly higher in hong kong than they are in sterling so i dont is it possible to help us a little bit about why you have this huge sensitivity in sterling and perhaps not so much in places like hong kong which are short dated ewen james a stevenson group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so look i mean firstly in hong kong remember that only around of our deposit balances are hong kong dollars so yeah there is an impact of particularly us dollar book in hong kong i think in that interest rate sensitivity which with the us dollar is about of yeah of the thats not hong kong dollars so yeah look well ill need to get you a detailed answer out of our ir team if you give them a call but ph assume that our interest rate sensitivity analysis is correct edward firth q analyst keefe bruyette woods hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2021 i suspect its about the assumption its just ph the thing were struggling with that in all areas is trying to make sure that people can put in any assumptions they like whether its actually going to happen i guess is the key question ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah thats fair but i mean yeah we do take time to show that interest rate sensitivity and it is supposed to be helpful guidance edward firth q analyst keefe bruyette woods okay no thats great thanks so much ill indiscernible operator thank you your next question comes from the line of martin leitgeb from goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international yes good morning just a very quick quick followup on structural hedging one of your peers has announced its intention to deploy structural hedging a little bit more just changing i guess some of the assumption on the stickiness of certain deposits is there scope just based on your comments that hong kong is very shortdated of hong kong deposits are in us dollar would there be scope to reassess some of those deposits and have you made it similar to the uk that deposits have a kind of ph have a maturity of five years and with that could this be a source for additional income going forward and secondly on capital i mean first of all thank you for the to guidance now for fy just in terms of thinking about the quarter one trajectory and ph at the end of scope for capital return for hsbc going forward over the medium term should we use this as a kind of a range going forward or is there scope for capital ph to achieve even lower im just trying to get if theres still capital inefficiencies within the group impacting this to range thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so in terms of hong kong and yeah i mean part of the problem martin as you know its a very short dated book both on the asset and liability side so the choice that we have always made is not to run currency risk to extend duration theres probably a low hundreds of millions opportunity in the next few years through improved management of our liquidity book weve recently hired a few months ago the group treasurer out of ubs to come and run our treasury business and so i think over the next two to three years weve probably got a few hundred million dollars of upside in terms of how were managing our global liquidity pool on capital i would use the ph to ph and for the next few years i think our aspiration is to run it towards lower end of that range if we can as you think further out theres obviously the impact of indiscernible and what that does and depending on where theyre applied and the impact on capital positions of subsidiaries etcetera were going to have to pay attention to to get below i think weve got a big program of work to step up our capabilities in stress testing i think our peak to trough fall in stress is still too high but that will be a multiyear program of work to improve stress testing hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2021 and then go after the sort of higher risk stress areas of the bank where were not getting remunerated appropriately but for the purposes of the foreseeable future assume that to is where were managing to and if we can well manage through the low end of that range martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international perfect thank you thank you very much operator thank you we will now take our final question from the line of joseph dickerson from jefferies please go ahead your line is open joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd hi good morning thanks for taking my question just on the cost versus benefit from rising rates i guess youve made the point that you havent lightened up on investment spend can we just should we therefore assume that the or so of the rate sensitivity of whatever we might assume falls through to the bottom line i guess what sort of quantum should we think about falls through to the bottom line ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc well i think the bulk of it frankly i mean it depends what inflationary pressure you put on a billion wage bill on a billion total cost base but yeah its relative to the previous guidance of flat cost if youve got to inflation on that thats million to million of incremental costs which i think more than gets offset by the interest rate rises i mean what we saw over the last year is the bulk of that we lost we werent able to offset with incremental cost savings so i think we will keep talking we will keep cost control tight even if we see the benefit of rate rises coming through joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd thanks very much very helpful noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc ewen just to ph tie it through the amount of revenue that dropped off the pl last year as a consequence of rate reductions was ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc billion noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc how much hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 25oct2021 ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc billion noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc yes so that gives you a sensitivity of the upside sensitivity of rates for the downside that we experienced relative to a percentage point or percentage points movement in costs its a highly leveraged ratio on revenue to cost joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd brilliant thank you operator thank you that was our final question i will now hand back for closing remarks ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc if i could just noel noel quinn group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah listen thank you so much for your time today a couple of closing comments for me first of all im pleased as i said at the beginning with the performance of the business and im pleased to see good signs of growth organic growth in fee income balanced growth wealth management so thats good i think more to come on that front we remain absolutely committed to driving out cost efficiencies as we indicated earlier this year we acknowledge that there are some inflationary pressures through bp from good business performance and from underlying inflation but we believe that there is offsetting revenue growth to compensate for that and we remain committed to our return on capital target so good progress more still to do well continue to transform the business and well continue to grow the business thank you for your time ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks everyone operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that
