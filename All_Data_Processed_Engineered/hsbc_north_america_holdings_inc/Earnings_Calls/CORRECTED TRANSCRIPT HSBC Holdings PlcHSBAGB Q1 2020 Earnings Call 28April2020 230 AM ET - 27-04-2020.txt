could never have anticipated and is causing huge disruption stress and uncertainty hsbc has a massive role to play in supporting our communities providing stability and helping to rebuild economic growth that purpose has been true throughout our history and remains true today we are determined to play our part to the very best of our ability hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2020 id like to pay tribute to the extraordinary work that our people have done and are doing for our customers and for each other each and every day i have been humbled by their dedication and commitment our operations have been highly resilient with around of our branches open for business more than of our staff working from home and a high degree of business continuity since the start of the year we have issued more than additional laptops to enable our colleagues to work from home we have increased our vpn capacity from to and enabled more than of our contact center stuff to work

and regulators to channel state support to the real economy quickly and efficiently in hong kong we have approved more than hkd billion of immediate liquidity relief to businesses facing market uncertainty and supply chain pressures we have granted more than of our eligible hong kong commercial banking clients a preapproved extension to their import trade loan facilities and we have put in

businesses we have been heavily involved in the uk cbil scheme approving more than applications worth over million thats around of all cbils lending by accredited lenders which has nearly doubled our market share for sme lending in the uk in total we have grown group lending by billion and seeing billion of deposit growth in the quarter as far as the plans we announced in february are concerned our intention is to continue to improve the long term capital and operational efficiency of the bank in the short term we have decided to pause the vast majority of redundancies associated with this program when notices have not already been issued continuing with our job reduction programs in the current environment would simply not be appropriate at a time of significant stress for our people and communities we are proceeding in other areas as planned including the combination of our wholesale backoffice operations and the combination of retail banking and wealth management with global private banking we have invested a further billion in business growth and digital in the quarter and accelerated our digital plans to improve customer access during the current crisis we are also applying the lessons of the last few weeks particularly from parts of the business that have responded to a fastmoving situation with exceptional pace and agility we will press ahead with our transformation thoughtfully and purposefully while doing everything necessary to safeguard the wellbeing of our customers and our people there will be no letup and will move at pace wherever we can as you know in response to a direct request from the bank of england the board canceled the payments of our fourth quarter dividend of the board also decided that until the end of we will make no quarterly or interim dividend payments or accruals in respect of ordinary shares we will review our dividend policy at or ahead of our yearend results turning to our performance we had a good start to the year with a solid january and february but in march the spread of the covid19 pandemic and the fall in oil prices had a sizeable impact on our first quarter numbers the resulting increase in expected credit loss provisions contributed to a drop in reported pretax profit and a fall in adjusted profits compared with the same period last year the impact of fall in markets and volatile income streams in insurance manufacturing and global banking and markets led to a fall in reported revenue generally though our businesses showed good resilience particularly in asia while retail banking global hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2020 markets and global private banking all grew revenue compared with last years first quarter we maintained good cost control with a drop in adjusted operating expenses of and our balance sheet remains robust with a cet1 ratio of and strong liquidity and funding at the end of the first quarter turning to some of our performance highlights in the quarter we added more than retail banking customers and grew retail deposits by more than billion worldwide we also enhanced our digital capabilities to serve more customers remotely to accelerate verification and to improve our ability to get our customers the products they need during the current crisis commercial banking lending balances saw a good growth largely due to client drawdowns on existing facilities and trade finance business showed great resilience particularly in asia and our recently upgraded hsbcnet treasury management platform for businesses saw a substantial increase in activity with downloads of the mobile app up and a rise in the volume of mobile payments both of which stand us in good stead for the future global private banking added a further billion of net new money in the quarter bringing the total over the last months to billion and global banking and markets did an excellent job keeping capital flowing to our customers leading on more than billion of financing for clients in the capital markets globally with respect to social and covid response bonds we helped our clients raise billion to support the covid19 relief effort we were at the forefront in reopening the global debt capital markets achieving a top bookrunner position for international bonds in europe the middle east and asia exjapan and we provided sustained access to equity capital markets for our customers achieving a leadership position in asia exjapan and exashare and raising more equity capital for uk listed corporates than any other bank since the start of the year im pleased with the way the business has responded in support of our customers and we continue to work extremely hard to meet the significantly increased funding demands we are seeing across many parts of the bank we know that the rest of will be immensely challenging but we face it with a resilient business and strong capital and liquidity with that ill pass it over to ewen to go through the numbers ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc thanks noel and good morning or afternoon all compared with the last years first quarter it was clearly a much tougher quarter a fall in reported pretax profits and a drop in adjusted pretax profits we had a decent january and february but march was heavily impacted by covid19 and the fall in oil prices and the outlook has significantly deteriorated since our february business update certain parts of our business continue to perform well in the quarter including our resilient performance in our hong kong and broader asian franchises the continuing turnaround of global private banking and a strong quarter for fixed income and currencies trading revenues in global markets but our results were heavily impacted by the sharp fall in equity markets the widening of credit spreads and much higher expected credit losses net volatile items were billion adverse to the first quarter of last year the prudent valuation adjustment against core tier was billion higher than the previous quarter and expected credit losses were billion or basis points of gross loans overall adjusted revenues were down against last years first quarter but up if you exclude volatile items net interest income grew by overall while noninterest income reduced by hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2020 we started to take action on costs to adjust for the weakened revenue environment our adjusted costs fell by against the first quarter of last year reflecting a reduced accrual for variable pay and various lower discretionary cost items our tangible net asset value per share of includes of our own credit adjustments or reserves thats a move quarteronquarter from a negative at yearend turning to revenue on slide total adjusted revenues in the first quarter were billion thats down on the first quarter in but up excluding volatile items looking across the four global businesses in retail banking and wealth management revenues were down but stable before negative market impacts in insurance manufacturing retail banking revenues grew by driven by higher customer deposits but wealth management revenues were down heavily impacted by a million negative movement in market impacts in insurance manufacturing however investment distribution revenues grew as a result of strong hong kong trading activity global private banking revenues were up underpinned by another strong net new money performance and higher customer activity levels in the quarter commercial banking revenues were down with global liquidity and cash management down due to lower interest rates credit and lending up reflecting growth in lending balances and trade finance up a resilient performance particularly in asia within global banking and markets while revenues were down overall global markets grew with a strong performance in fixed income and currencies trading up against this were adverse movements of million in credit and funding valuation adjustments and million in bidoffer adjustments while our principal investments business made a loss of million in the quarter in corporate centre revenues were up million balance sheet management was up million due to gains on disposals and we had a million increase in favorable fair value movements on our own longterm debt and associated swaps on slide net interest income was billion thats stable against the fourth quarter of our net interest margin was basis points thats down basis points on the fourth quarter thats included a combined basispoint adverse impact from margin compression reflecting lower rates and hyperinflation in argentina and a 1basispoint favorable impact from lower customer redress costs in the uk ringfenced bank given the drop in interest rates since the start of the year around basis points globally we expect an impact on net interest income of more than billion in which is greater than our february guidance at our fullyear results turning to slide adjusted costs were lower than the first quarter in and thats despite a further billion of investment in business growth and digital where we can weve begun to take action on costs including a million lower accrual for variable pay the start of a material reduction in the approximately million we spent last year on travel and entertainment and discipline across various other discretionary cost line items we now expect fullyear costs to be below 2019s run rate with a degree of reduction in some line items dependent on various factors including group profitability which could drive further cuts to the variable pay accrual in the coming quarters and the impact on activity levels in our operations as a result of covid19 and due to the current pause in parts of our transformation plan we also expect to spend less on costs to achieve in than previously guided on the next slide we saw a substantially higher credit cost provisions in the first quarter some billion or basis points of gross loans this reflected extra charges across all global businesses and regions largely reflecting to the changed forward economic outlook ph as it accounts of covid19 and the falling oil price around half of first quarter expected credit losses were for stage exposures with all of the stage increase hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2020 coming in wholesale including a significant charge in commercial banking related to a corporate exposure in singapore as well as charges in global banking and markets relating to a small number of clients as you can see we have provided a range for group expected credit losses of billion to billion for the midpoint of that range is based on the billion charge for first quarter plus billion for the rest of based on the historic average run rate plus a further billion representing the incremental expected credit losses from weighting of our severe scenario which is disclosed in the earnings release the bottomend of the range represents a milder economic scenario than our severe scenario with an economic recovery commencing in the second half of and the topend of the range represents an economic scenario worse than our current severe scenario extending into we will no doubt update our thinking here as we go through the year there is a wide range of potential outcomes including the risk at the upperend of the range may increase and i would encourage you in that regard to read our covid19 risk factor in the earnings release turning to slide both customer loans and advances in customer deposits saw a good headline growth on a constant currency basis since the end of last year customer loans and advances grew by billion or and customer deposits grew by billion or part of this growth came from customers in commercial banking and global banking and markets as a result of both drawing down on committed credit line facilities and then partially redeploying these funds into their deposit accounts to increase their cash reserves this continues the trends of the past several quarters where weve seen consistently good volume growth across the customer franchises and resilient performances in key areas such as trade financing and cash management our funding and liquidity ratios remain robust we continue to have a low and stable loantodeposit ratio and significant excess high quality liquid assets on slide our core tier ratio at the end of first quarter was thats down basis points from the end of the cancellation of the fourth quarter dividend in added basis points to our core tier ratio this and the decision to not pay an interim dividend in this quarter offset the negative impacts of lower profitability fx movements and an increased prudent valuation adjustment riskweighted assets rose by billion in the quarter this was primarily due to loan growth partially offset by fx movements due to the strong us dollar weve seen limited impact from price cyclicality so far less than billion of movements from changes in credit quality in the first quarter however we currently expect price cyclicality impacts to increase materially during hence our guidance on expecting mid to highsingledigit rwa growth for the year as a whole as a result we expect our core tier ratio to decline in the coming quarters and were comfortable if necessary falling below our target over and as we progress through the price cyclical impacts of covid19 while retaining capital capacity to continue to support our customers so in summary a good january and february and a difficult march the combined impact of covid19 and lower oil prices has significantly impacted some of our businesses while others have proved fairly resilient then just the forward economic guidance coupled with certain stage exposures caused a significant spike in expected credit loss provisions and we expected credit losses to remain elevated over the remainder of the year with a broad range of outcomes foreseeable depending on the economic impact of covid19 hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2020 we were there for our customers in the quarter with good volume growth in both lending and deposits weve begun to take necessary action on costs and retain some capacity to partially offset a further drop in revenue across the coming quarters our liquidity and funding ratios remain robust providing our customers with stability during the current disruption but the economic outlook for the remainder of the year is expected to now be much weaker than previously guided at our fullyear results well continue to monitor the impact of the covid19 crisis and review our financial performance and business plan accordingly at the same time well continue to assess the appropriateness of our financial targets and well review our dividend policy after or ahead of our fullyear results were not expecting the next three quarters to be easy but we enter this difficult period with strong capital and liquidity a strong and resilient franchise particularly in asia an ability to invest in the business while also managing cost down and a commitment to continue to build for the future while responding to the needs of our customers in the present with that sharon if we could please open up for questions question and answer section operator thank you mr stevenson operator instructions we will now take our first question from joseph dickerson jefferies please go ahead your line is open joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd hi good morning i guess a couple of questions noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc good morning joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd firstly on the hong kong ecl charge of million it didnt have some of the same movement as you saw elsewhere and its kind of in line with the run rates just any comments as to whats driving that business mix and i guess what your outlook is for that market firstly and then secondly on the line drawdown so right now thats translating through to deposit growth but are there going to be any earnings associated with these drawdowns and if so are these baked into your guidance around things like net interest income et cetera thanks much noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc joseph thank you ill take the second question first if i can and then pass on to ewen for the first question with respect to the drawdowns yes we do anticipate there being earnings associated with those drawdowns and that will therefore help mitigate some of the impacts of the rates effects on the deposit book hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2020 and just a quick comment on your first question i think what weve seen in the first quarter is the resilience of hong kong again as a business and as a customer base clearly there are uncertainties on the horizon with respect to coronavirus and covid19 and how it will develop but weve been very pleased with the resilience of the hong kong customer base ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc but in terms of the ecl charge in the quarter it did benefit from the release of around million of overlays as you recall during the second half of last year we did build up fairly reasonable overlays in relation to the hong kong book given what we could see at the time joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd yeah okay it makes sense thanks operator thank you your next question comes from the line of fahed kunwar from redburn please go ahead your line is open fahed kunwar q analyst redburn europe ltd hi morning noel morning ewen noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc good morning fahed kunwar q analyst redburn europe ltd i just had a couple of questions one was on nim i think in your sensitivity guidance you talk about kind of indiscernible the loss on revenues indiscernible so for the billion or greater than billion hit to nii that you flagged in in terms of and assuming rates where they are did that hit to nii continue to build or have you baked in all of the hits into in that kind of basis point margin hit that was the first question and the second question was on credit rwa inflation could you just give a bit more color on this i guess the pra was talking about kind of look at the shock as temporary if i look at some of your peers their credit migration hasnt been as strong and us peers credit migration wasnt as strong either whats really driven the cyclical kind of increase in rwa inflation that youre guiding to now for the full year and if you dont mind just a third question on credit card spending as well has a lot of those credit card activity being people kind of maxing out their maximum kind of credit allowance and do you think that will continue throughout the course of the year on the credit card book thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2020 ill pick up the credit card quickly weve seen a significant reduction in credit card activity over the last two or three months i think were down seen a reduction in spending of around about ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah so its actually the reverse of what youve just said people are not maxing out their credit cards what theyre actually doing is not spending and the balances are actually coming down at the moment on net interest income i think you should expect as per the tables that we previously provided that there will continue to be impacts from the lower rate environment if this was to persist into and as you continue to get the progressive cumulative impact of those lower interest rates what i would say is though that the interest rate sensitivity of the bank we do have quite a shortdated book particularly in hong kong both on the asset side and liability side the trade book is relatively shortdated so you do see a very meaningful impact in year one which were signaling with the billion and then the impact is progressively substantially less in the subsequent years on credit rating migration im not sure about the peer comparisons if you look at  rating the impact of ratings migration was less than billion in terms of the uplift in rwas i think what were signaling for the full year though that the bulk of that uplift that were now talking about mid to highsingle digits will be as a result of expected credit rating migrations we provided you i think some disclosure in the past on the book that you can run numbers on but you should assume that the bulk of that uplift is because of anticipated ratings migration over the final three quarters noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc and you normally have a lag effect of to months it starts to feed in as companies update their financial reporting so there is normally a lag effect on credit rating migration and weve just given you guidance on thats still to come ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc but i mean consistent with the guidance around expected credit losses there is a broad range around that estimate in the same way there is around expected credit loss estimate for the full year fahed kunwar q analyst redburn europe ltd no of course thats fair enough thank you very much cheers operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of tom rayner numis please go ahead your line is open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc hi tom hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2020 tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd good morning ewen good morning good morning noel noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hi tom tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd can i just have a few on rwas please and then maybe a quick one on costs as well could you just confirm the base figure for the mid to highsingledigit growth guidance because there was quite a big fx move in  i just wanted to check that weve got the sort of starting point right for the guidance i wonder if you could then maybe comment following on perhaps somewhat on the last question what the direction of the sort of rwa movements if we look beyond whether youd expect further sort of positive credit rating migration to come in or whether you might actually start to see that reverse again and also maybe comment on the timing of the billion reduction that was part of the restructuring program whether how far back has that now been pushed and then finally on rwas just loan drawdowns again how much of that is translating into rwa as well thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah so i think i got four questions on rwas tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd yeah ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc we didnt get to costs yet tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd do you want the costs ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc no its okay let me do the rwas first tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd okay ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2020 so if you use around billion i think as a sort of base for the rwa inflation for the remainder of the year in terms of ratings migration i think if yeah as noel just said in terms of the lag effect you should expect i think some continued ratings migration into the early part of next year assuming were into a stronger recovery at that point post the trough and covid19 impacts then youre right over time you should see that ratings migration begin to reverse over the remainder of into the impact of drawdowns i think we have provided some analysis of where in the earnings release on where you saw significant uplifts in rwas which principally were in global banking and markets and commercial banking a decent part of that was in relation to drawdowns on the drawdowns themselves we did see substantive levels of drawdowns in sort of midmarch towards the back end of march that has eased off substantially in april and in fact in some cases some of the money being drawn down has actually reversed out now so i think you should view that very much as a significant impact on  that we wont see repeatable during the remainder of the year at this point tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd okay and thank you for that and only one part on the cost question just the sort of the redundancy program the which obviously has been put on hold for now im just wondering how much youve therefore had to absorb in terms of cost reductions which have been pushed further out to sort of in your guidance and then whats how that sort of might phase in as we look further forward in terms of the benefit of those redundancies coming out of the staff cost going forward thanks noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah tom ill take that we thought it was the right thing to do for the benefit of our customers and our people to actually pause that redundancy program at this point in time in we wanted our people to be focused on serving customers and not to be fearful of our redundancy program hence the pause the cost of that pause in terms of loss savings in is in the order of a roundabout million of foregone savings in now as ewen said earlier on we believe we can mitigate that impact by cost savings elsewhere in the elements of costs that are variable and under our own control that are not people related and if you go back to our february presentation we guided that our total cost base for would be flat on now were guiding that our cost base for will be lower than but we can mitigate that loss of savings plus some by reduction in other elements of the cost base such as hiring activities travel and vp and other discretionary line items the issue for us will then be at what point do we reactivate that program in order to make sure that and cost base is appropriately positioned but its too early to make that call at this point in time ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah and tom just to give you some numbers around that last year we paid out billion in variable pay travel and entertainment was just over million marketing was just over billion so there was about billion of spend across those three line items we accrued spent about less in the first quarter across those three line items than we had in the previous year yeah which would get you to fairly meaningful cost reductions hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2020 yeah when noel was talking about the pause in the restructuring program and certain elements of that i think what that means is that at the full year we also talked about billion of cost to achieve of which about of that would be incurred in i think you should have seen that that number will come down but it will be a timing difference so i think the right way to think about the program is we intend to do the program but the front end of it will have sloped id make the same observation about the rwa rundown program we still think that we can do the bulk of what we expected to do this year i think some of the sticky and more complex stuff may be harder to shift and it really comes down to an economic case whether we want to crystallize valuations at that level or we want to pause but again i think realistically well get the bulk of what we wanted to do done this year but with some pause part of that into next year tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd okay and should i assume you havent flagged it specifically that the actual investment sort of strategic investment spend is not going to get chopped significantly noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc were targeting our strategic investment spend obviously much more cautiously today than we would have done three four months ago but were still spending on programs that we believe are strategically important for the future particularly in anything to do with digital weve seen the evidence of that in the first quarter we spent well over the past two years on upgrading many of our digital platforms i mentioned the treasury management platform for corporates and the mobile version of that weve seen a massive takeup in activity levels on that platform and i think we see the covid19 situation increasing the demand for digital support and therefore we will continue to invest in it tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd okay thanks thanks very much operator thank you your next question comes from the line of martin leitgeb goldman sachs please go ahead ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc hi martin martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international yes good morning good morning i just wanted to ask to start with on your view on how severe this credit cycle is going to get and i mean just looking at some of the economic forecasts out there it seems to indicate that the base of economic contraction is worse than what we have experienced in prior credit cycles hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2020 on the other hand there is equally a number of government support schemes in place which aimed at obviously softening the impact and i was just wondering if you could help us in that sense how you think about the credit cycle and tied to that just in terms of the billion to billion ecl guidance for this year is it possible to point to some form of real gdp assumption for this year which this is tied to i think one of the european peers tied their guidance to a specific contraction number in gdp and i was just wondering if theres any more color you can give us either for the billion to billion or for the severe case in terms of cumulative real gdp contraction and lastly i was just wondering in terms of looking at your loan book geographically if there is any elements within geographies that you are most concerned about it seems like asia particularly hong kong is holding up ph better already part of cycle has already started to recover there is it other parts of the book outside of asia youre most worried at this point thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc so martin ill take couple of comments first and then pass to ewen specifically on the billion to billion our job at the moment is to position the bank to manage a variety of different outcomes that could emerge from covid none of us know for certain what the severity of the crisis will be were modeling different scenarios and were making sure as a bank we prepare for each of those scenarios that could emerge and thats why were confident we can handle this because of the strong capital the strong liquidity that we have but none of us know for sure were not and im not a medical professional im not an economist so our job is to be prepared for all of the scenarios with respect to the government support schemes weve been particularly impressed with the pace and the determination that the governments around the world in hong kong in china or in the uk in the us have put in place support schemes that are very very material but again none of us know fully weve not seen that level of support come in and we havent yet seen how that will change customer behavior so were very positive on them we factor them into our scenarios to provide mitigation for some of the risks that we see but only time will tell as to how effective they are at supporting the economy but they are very beneficial to have in place and well see how they work over time with respect to billion to billion ill hand over to ewen ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah so i wouldnt look the billion to billion martin is part science part art the i wouldnt try and say look here is the gdp forecast the gdp recovery profile and that gets you to x i think thats too simplistic were having to overlay as noel just talked about fairly unprecedented levels of government support which we think will significantly mitigate some of the more extreme scenarios you may have seen in terms of expected credit losses also covid19 personally i think its going to be quite disruptive to the profile of how some industries recover how the airline industry recovers will be different to another sector for example but equally within a sector like the airline sector how governments respond and who gets recapped maybe very different too so its not a straightforward piece of math that we can give you to say this gets you to the low end and that gets you to the high end the thing i would probably pay most attention to is the recovery profile that we begin to see as we progress through the second and third quarters of this year were already seeing the start of a decent recovery particularly in mainland china and to a lesser extent hong kong we expect the second quarter to be tough in western hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2020 europe uk us and other places and therefore we are understanding the path of that recovery into the second half of this year i think so therefore when we stand up at  results i think we know a lot more well be able to provide you with a lot more color at that point on what were seeing in terms of the question on geography i think if you look at the spread of ecls in  a couple of observations yeah we took billion of the billion in asia if you back out hong kong and mainland china there was about million across the region a decent chunk of that related to one single name exposure we had thats been commented on in the press in singapore so asia definitely outperformed yeah but it was pretty broad based across the rest of the world on the retail side we have some emerging signs of deterioration in the consumer credit portfolios across a number of markets on the wholesale side it was pretty diverse and not just covid but also all price related martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international and just a followup in terms of your comment if we were to think about and the comments on the recovery should we then expect a comparatively sharp drop in risk costs again from todays perspective or would this in any case take longer to level off from here ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc look i mean if you are being conservative you would assume i think that there is going to continue to be elevated credit costs in but the price cyclical impact of ifrs should mean that is materially ahead of and then you should begin to see i would have thought a relatively sharp drop off as you get into martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international perfect very helpful thank you very much operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of guy stebbings exane please go ahead your line is open guy stebbings q analyst exane sa united kingdom morning noel ewen thanks for taking the questions just wanted to come back firstly on capital and rwas and the commentary around comfortable going below this year if we take the rwa guidance and assume circa growth for the rest of the year that would knock up about basis points i think and if we assume cash generation prerwa is comparable with the first quarter of basis points you end up back in the middle of the to range so im trying to understand if going below is reflective of the dividend taking you there with  perhaps being more than just the normal final or if the basis points underlying run rate cash generation prerwa moves that we saw in  could be lower for the rest of the year so that was the first question and now i had a quick question on bocom in the earnings release you referenced should the current environment persists that it might have implications for certain assets like your stake in bocom i dont think you published the value that youve seen in  but im not sure if you calculated internally and what youre seeing there or whether we have to wait for h1 for an update thanks hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2020 ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah just quickly on bocom no change in approach the value in use continues to be higher than where we hold the asset and well update more fully as part of  results i havent got your math on capital but i think we can imagine scenarios as we progress through and that our core tier ratio will fall below i think as we progress through the price cyclicality impacts of ifrs both in terms of ecls and the impact on rwa inflation because of ratings migration i think we are comfortable operating the bank in sort of to range if necessary over and i dont think were going to be under any regulatory pressure at that level our mda as you would have seen has actually fallen because of the reduction in countercyclical buffers for the mda for the group now is at so we would be several hundred basis points above mda at that level and as i say actually the regulators at the moment i think would be comfortable probably operating at levels below that because theyre very keen for us to continue to be able to support domestic lending both in hong kong and here in the uk so itd be very much i think driven by our view as to what the appropriate level of capital is and i also would not read into that any implications about future dividend policy and where we may see it guy stebbings q analyst exane sa united kingdom okay thanks very much operator thank you your next question comes from the line of manus costello from autonomous please go ahead your line is open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc hi manus manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp thank you yes hi how are you doing noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hi manus manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp i just wanted to follow up really on the question around the dividend please you said with the strategy update you and the group would need a sustainable return on tangible equity of to in order to keep the dividend sustainable but youve outlined for us today pressure on nii of an extra billion and rising potentially further pressures on ecl so my question is what goes into the mix in terms of working out the future dividend payout would you constrain rwa growth in the future in order to sustain the dividend or have you got further cost cuts which can help drive the back up to the to return hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2020 ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc so i mean what youve repeated back to me in terms of what i said is what i said so the i think were going to need to sit down later in the year and really understand where we are in sort of postcovid19 environment where the longterm trajectory on interest rates are where longterm trajectory on business growth is does that environment have implications for parts of the strategy that we set out in february and when you throw all of that together in the mix where do you get to a combination of sustainable returns and sustainable growth out of that you can then say what is the sustainable distribution policy but its sort of too early to sit here today and give you guidance on that realistically i think we wont be having that discussion well into the second half of the year and were obviously committed to give you an update ahead of full year results in manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp but there isnt an extra billion or billion of costs that you can easily strip out of the business presumably to make up the nii deficit ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah look i mean that would be part of the mix too that were going to have to consider and as i had talked about earlier i went through three line items that got to billion of cost that we think we can materially reduce but obviously flexing down the cost structure and ability to flex down the cost structure and as noel referred to earlier were already beginning to see the emergence of a meaningful shift in some markets towards greater use of digital channels than what we would have seen and the acceleration probably in parts of our business plan towards digital that we couldnt have imagined a few months ago so again thats part of the mix of things that were going to have to think about post understanding of where covid19 takes us manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp okay i just have one very quick followup on the credit cost which people had asked about im just trying to juxtapose your billion to billion with the much higher charge you take in the uk stress test youre over billion over five years a lot of that is in years ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp one and two is the delta between your severe scenario and the bank being in the stress test the government support which you mentioned or is it the pace of recovery in that youre assuming things get better quite quickly next year which of those two is dominant in producing a lower ecl ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2020 well i think therere sort of three things i think the extent of government support i think has a material mitigating impact relative to what you saw in the acs results i think again the pace of recovery and the shape of that recovery i think looks very different to what you saw in the acs and the first thing id point to is just parts of asia are already in recovery manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp yeah ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc so the i do think when weve done that comparison for ourselves were comfortable for the time being the billion to billion range weve sat down and thought about how that sits alongside an acs scenario noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc acs was much more penal on our asian franchise than the current scenarios we model in for covid19 manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp understood thats very clear thank you very much guys operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of edward firth kbw please go ahead your line is open edward firth q analyst kbw yes morning everybody sorry just a very quick points of clarification so just to be clear in terms of your billion to billion impairment guidance its too simplistic to say that relates to the gdp range that youve given its not a straight like billion is at the topend and billion is at the bottom in line with those sort of gdp ranges is that too simplistic a sensitivity ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yes one edward firth q analyst kbw okay and secondly the ratings migration that youve highlighted in the terms of riskweighted assets i think you said that that does incorporate something for government schemes or sort of regulatory comments about trying to mitigate the extent of that can you give us some have you got any idea of roughly how much what it would have been without that because it seems to be a huge number even on its own and im just trying to get a sense as to what the sort of sensitivity around that might be hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2020 ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc no i mean look we provide you i think in the full year results disclosure on the credit profile of our loan book and you could run proxy estimates across that of what the impact of one or greater notch downgrade would be i think we see the impact of the government support is that well limit the degree of downward notching of the corporate book that we would otherwise expect but you can run approximate maths in some of the disclosures that weve already got out there to come up with your own views on that but yeah that mid to single digit midtohigh singledigit growth in rwas is consistent with a fairly significant credit deterioration across the book over the remainder of the year noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc and i think what youre seeing is a change in the relationship in the modeled relationship between a credit migration on the balance sheet and the ecls that may emerge in the pl account and that the government schemes are mitigating some of the emergence of the ecl but youre still going to get the credit migration youre still going to get a movement in your balance sheet but that movement will not straight line or model in the usual way into a pl impact and thats why i think you may get a breakage in the normal relationship edward firth q analyst kbw and yeah no it does make sense and im just sort of in the context of your strategy which is taking out billion is i assume that this year theres very little of that included is that correct ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc no i would disassociate what weve just that from yeah we do we have a program a fairly mappedout program to reduce rwas by billion over the next three years where we can execute parts of that program in this environment we will execute it and we do think the bulk of what we thought we could do this year we will end up doing by the end of the year but not all of it edward firth q analyst kbw okay great thanks so much operator thank you your next question comes from the line of raul sinha from jpmorgan please go ahead your line is open raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc morning noel and ewen just a couple of questions for me then coming back to the billion obviously there was billion ph gross part of your reduction that we talked about but there was also the billion of growth in initiatives that obviously youre trying to do over your threeyear plan and i was just wondering how the changed environment sort of impacts your thinking around where you wanted to position the business in terms of growth and where you actually are seeing capital consumption going up so just some thoughts on how that billion of reinvestment would look like are you just parking that to the side for the moment hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2020 and then the second one maybe a bit more specific on ecls i have had a look at the page disclosures which are really helpful so thank you for that but the questions i have still remaining are around the oil price for example how are you factoring in oil price risk within your scenarios and also weve seen a significant increase in fraud losses obviously you mentioned the one in singapore but there has also been one in middle east and i was just wondering what risk management lessons are you drawing from that and have you looked at the rest of your book for potential losses within that thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc okay let me take the rwa growth comment i mean you could argue weve just done billion of rwa growth in the first quarter out of the billion because it didnt come in the way that was originally intended through newtobank and newnew business but we saw an expansion in the balance sheet as customers drew down on credit lines now will we see that repeated in    no ewen is rightly to guide to that that level of balance sheet expansion is unlikely to repeat in future quarters but weve already put billion of earning assets on the book in three months well see how that moves over time in terms of the billion program i gave a statement in my opening comments that were still committed to capital efficiency the capital efficiency program we launched in february we have to adjust in light of covid19 but the longterm goal of taking capital from underperforming businesses and reinvesting in performing businesses is still our intent and im pleased to say that rwa growth in the first quarter is happening with good clients longterm strategic clients and in good areas of the business with respect to fraud and then ill hand off to ewen on how oil has been factored into the scenarios clearly at a time of stress the emergence of fraud becomes more prevalent so a time of economic stress normally identifies fraudulent situations that are taking place and therefore we are alert to that risk we are doing a number of the deep dives by sector on our portfolios that would be more susceptible to that and thats part and parcel of normal credit management and were taking learning from any situations that emerge to try and read across to other parts of the portfolio and adjust it quarterly so were taking those proactive steps id hand off to ewen on oil price scenarios ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah we i mean weve included a slide on what our oil and gas prices are at the back end of the appendix is billion of exposure at the end of  yeah the higher end of the billion to billion range clearly includes specific sector or stresses in some places including the oil and gas sector so we have thought about it we have tried to build an appropriate stresses until that range raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc got it thank you operator thank you we have time for one more question from aman rakkar from barclays please go ahead your line is open hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call 28apr2020 aman rakkar q analyst barclays investment bank morning guys ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc good morning aman rakkar q analyst barclays investment bank its aman from barclays hope you guys are staying safe just a couple of questions then please so just following your disclosure on the atrisk sector stuff thanks very much for that can you give us a sense of any existing provisions that youve got against those books in terms of what kind of coverage you have after what youve spoken today in particular would be useful im just kind of thinking about what the kind of residual risk from those exposures from here so any color you can give there would be really good and then another on government guaranteed lending i was just really interested in whether when you kind of look forward do you envisage that being a material driver of the group balance sheet kind of going forward i know take up until now has been fairly slow but obviously youre seeing an acceleration in the terms of that scheme at least guarantee i guess as part of that as well itd be interesting also if you could can you give us some indication of the kind of commercial terms of lending under that scheme as well so whats the fee that you have to pay to the uk government for the guarantee lets say and versus the now on the smallest lending and i mean particularly on that last tranche of lending is there any reason why thats not potentially a fairly profitable form of lending i saw that the pra basically confirmed yesterday that you should benefit from credit risk mitigation benefits on expected credit loss and risk density so the provision charge and the capital of that lending continues potentially implies thats pretty profitable lending is there anything i kind of misunderstood there thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc okay on the new scheme were still working through the details of that that well launch next week as you say its guarantee the fees and the pricing structure is still under debate so i cant give any details on that at this stage we support the program we think its a good initiative and were doing it because we think its right for the customers not because we view this as a profit opportunity we think it will be the right thing to do and in the grand scheme of things on our balance sheet the size of our balance sheet its not something that i would guide you from an investor point of view that it would be material in the grand scheme of our balance sheet but it is material to the customers that are taking drawing down those funds and its important to the uk economy but it wouldnt change your modeling in any way with respect to the materiality of that scheme or the other governments scheme that are being launched and in terms of ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah in terms of the sector specific disclosure i just refer you back to the full year disclosures we had that well update at the interim results were not planning to give you further details at this point hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript
