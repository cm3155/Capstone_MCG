management discussion section faisal yousaf group treasurer hsbc investment bank plc hello everyone thank you for joining us im fas yousaf treasurer and im joined by greg case head of debts investor relations and mark phin head of equity investor relations ill keep my opening remarks relatively brief as im sure youve had a chance to go through the results over the course of the day there is also a comprehensive debt for fixed income investors available on our website and well flash up a few selected slides as i talk once i finished well go straight to qa so today we announced a good set of underlying fourth quarter results and record full year profit before tax of billion reported revenue was billion driven by supportive interest rates and underlying business growth the return on average tangible equity for was we returned billion to shareholders and weve announced a further up to billion buyback to be completed ahead of results we continue to target midteens rote for during the year we acquired what was svb uk which has enabled us to build our global innovation banking proposition we also completed the sale of our french retail business on the 1st of january this year and following approval from the canadian government the sale of our canadian business is on track to complete in  we are mindful of where we are in the interest rate cycle as such we have been and will continue to be focused on lowering our earnings sensitivity through hedging driving growth in noninterest income and of course cost discipline moving to the quarterly view briefly in the fourth quarter revenue was billion our underlying profit before tax was impacted by billion of notable items and billion related to hyperinflation in argentina the notable items largely consisted of the rerecognition of an impairment related to the sale of our french retail business and the impairment of our stake in bank of communications or bocom turning to credit quality for the full year the ecl charge was billion or basis points as we look out to we expect our cost of risk to be at around basis points given the ongoing macro uncertainty for hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 21feb2024 mainland china cre the full year ecl charge on the portfolio was billion in line with the full year plausible downside scenario that we set out last february our main focus with respect to this portfolio remains the mainland china cre portfolio booked in hong kong which has reduced by billion in overall and now sits at billion gross with provisions of billion against it turning to structural hedging our banking nii sensitivity to a basis point downshock is billion this has reduced by just over since june with more than a third of this due to structural interest rate hedging our structural hedge size and duration has increased during the year the hedge has a weighted average life of years and subject to market conditions we expect to increase the notional and duration further in as part of our structural hedging activity we took billion of treasury disposal losses in for risk management purposes the replacement hedge is a longer duration with a higher yield now moving on to balance sheet and issuance firstly a few words on our capital position cet1 ratio remained strong at up percentage points in and broadly stable in the fourth quarter at the end of the quarter we were billion or percentage points above our mda level which was during the year we generated one percentage point of capital through earnings after making shareholder distributions of percentage points the group remains highly capital generative the impairments of bocom had no significant impact on our cet1 ratio and we expect the sale of our canadian business to add percentage points to the ratio on completion in the first quarter of this year cet1 planned operating range remains to id expect our cet1 ratio to remain above this range for the next few quarters given the disposal of canada our mrel ratio was of rwas percentage points above our requirement and we expect to maintain a prudent buffer the group retained strong levels of liquidity with a welldiversified deposit base we have a total deposit base of trillion and our loan to deposit ratio is we hold trillion in high quality liquid assets and the group lcr rose percentage points to in the year i would highlight here that the consolidated lcr is calculated using conservative assumptions and major subsidiaries ph all operate lcrs that are significantly higher than the consolidated level finally moving onto issuance and starting with holdco senior this years plan is lower than our usual run rate with negative net issuance likely we see gross issuance of less than billion against maturities and calls of around billion we would expect to be closer to previous years issuance levels in and beyond id also note that last year we reduced our reliance on the us dollar market with around of our senior holdco being in us dollars compared to around historically for tier we expect to issue billion to billion gross in against billion of maturities this will broadly be half of the amount we issued in with respect to at1 we have modest needs this year particularly given anticipated ph extra cet1 position at this stage we plan to issue around billion of gross at1 but well keep this under evaluation over the course of the year we have just over billion of at1 with available call options in so in summary a good year with record profitability midteens return on tangible equity and billion of returns to shareholders our capital position is strong with good capital generation through earnings we maintain prudent funding and liquidity positions and we have modest issuance needs in were confident about the future having built a business model that provides balanced growth good returns with improved stability on that note lets open the call up for qa greg hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 21feb2024 question and answer section greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks fas so if youd like to signal for question please use the raise your hand function in zoom and then well ask you to unmute your line im afraid as i did note in my emails we wont be able to take calls from people whove dialed in by the phones so if youd like to ask a question please do email me directly and ill happily read that out so in the meantime while we wait for people to signal for questions we have a first question submitted from tom jenkins at jefferies and tom asks when are you going to address your legacy tier specifically the and the faisal yousaf a group treasurer hsbc investment bank plc okay thank you tom so probably there are three different dimensions id like to cover here i guess to start with as weve said before were in active dialogue with our regulators on our legacy stack and i would say there is a good understanding on both sides as you know the bank of england expect firms to take what they describe as appropriate and proportionate steps to reduce legacy instruments and thats very much in line with our own strategy we have made some progress over the past couple of years so two or three years i would say reducing the balance by over billion theres a slide in the deck that gives a bit more detail on that but nevertheless we still have around billion remaining and this is something that im very focused on trying to address to talk a little bit about the way we think about prioritizing this this legacy stack the various factors we take into account and i guess in no particular order one of the first things wed look at is assessing the complexity and the options to resolve legacy instruments wed obviously look at the economics and the size of the issuance and think about pursuing fair treatment for bondholders and shareholders alike and obviously the regulatory guidance comes into that and thats whats really influenced the priority order that we look at this stuff in so thats kind of a general view on our approach but specifically i guess tom to your question i cant share at this point any specifics about instruments and what we intend to do but i think its reasonable to assume that in the case that you describe some of the problems are likely to be down to complexity involved maybe the legal conditions timing and costs and as i said earlier were really looking at reasonable and proportionate steps where we can on the indiscernible specifically weve not taken action yet and as you know its been over two years since the conditions allowed us to so you could probably assume that its just not conducive at this point to take those actions hopefully that addresses your question greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks fas so the first question comes from the line of robert smalley at ubs rob weve opened your line robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 21feb2024 hi good morning thanks for taking my call couple of questions first on capital generation and im going kind of back and forth between presentations but it looks like you generate about cet1 or did in the past year basis points per quarter or so its a little lumpy but do you think thats the right run rate there number one number two with respect to putting that into dividends and buybacks it seems like you used about half your generated capital to do that is that a good metric to look at and then on the uk ring fenced bank rote for the year over could you talk about the performance there youve had an abundance of deposits there that youve deployed both in mortgages and now it appears more penetration for large corporates could you talk about some of the wins that youve had there and how you see the business going forward how youre going to maintain margins and how you see asset quality development thank you faisal yousaf a group treasurer hsbc investment bank plc okay thanks rob quite a few questions there ill try to address them so first of all on the capital generation piece yes as you said i think i quoted in my prepared notes that we see capital generation but that was after dividends and buybacks and so the capital generation is in excess of that yearonyear at the moment given where we are so i think thats worth bearing in mind youre right though in terms of your math on the basis points it is basis points per quarter at billion buyback so we did billion of buyback in and we just announced a further billion for this quarter so overall on the capital generation and our capability to retain that kind of flow of dividend payout ratio and buybacks were pretty confident at this stage given where we are in the rate cycle and obviously well monitor that fairly closely and im not giving any guidance just for clarity in terms of future buybacks but we will think that through as we go along and weve got obviously the canada sale coming up hopefully to complete at the end of  which will bolster our cash position on the ring fenced bank comment and question yeah look weve had a very healthy return on tangible equity as you point out we are seeing competitive pricing pressure in deposits in the uk generally i think there are probably a few factors that drive that the upcoming tf sme refinancing in the market it might be one of those factors cost of living and  pressures might be others as well i think my own view is that you see some of the smaller players that dont have access necessarily to the capital markets as wanting to be particularly competitive on pricing there are obviously as we know also economic uncertainties which have been well discussed and we need to see how that all plays out but from our perspective the economy has been very resilient indeed and we continue to see strong performance then obviously were not being complacent our view is that as rates start to come down and decline that should trigger ph for our small lending and get the balance sheet moving a little bit more overall just to give you perhaps a little bit more color on the uk deposit picture and ph perhaps broaden out because i think itll be of interest to others as well and talk a bit about the hong kong deposits weve seen in the uk come down yearonyear by about billion thats reflective of the broader industry trends that i talked about and the pressures on customers weve seen in that wpb balances come down by about billion in cmb come down by about billion so that covers the uk bank but more broadly if we look at the overall group weve seen a positive uptick in hong kong deposits thats pretty much as the asia in totality is about billion up on the year and a third of that is due to the deposit campaign that we pursued in the fourth quarter so overall thats whats thats some hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 21feb2024 color to the overall movement that weve seen in our deposit base at the group level and you can see overall deposits for the year are up that does take into account some of the ph svb asset acquisition as well hopefully that addresses both of your questions robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc thats very helpful thank you and thanks for doing the call faisal yousaf a group treasurer hsbc investment bank plc no problem thank you rob have a good day greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks rob so weve got a question submitted in from panos toskas at natwest and so first this asks can we have a clarification around your ibor expo securities you say on the slides that we do not intend to use libor as a means to extract value from holders of our mrel and regulatory capital what does this mean specifically and does it refer to all currencies and across cost of capital stack faisal yousaf a group treasurer hsbc investment bank plc okay thank you panos thank you for the question so probably a few factors to talk through here look our overarching principle really that were working towards is that we want to work together with investors to reach a solution thats mutually agreeable and in line of course with regulatory requirements now obviously that may not be possible in all cases but our approach is to try to not leave investors with legacy libor risk without first offering them some kind of market standard reach out weve made some pleasing progress and what i would describe as pleasing progress on remediation over a few years now as i think you will know panos that we undertook successful consents on our sterling english law securities in i think it was and we also redeemed some of our saving bonds in and we made announcements in detailing alterations that we would make for us securities following the libor act and arrc fallbacks but onto the particular statement that we added to our slides in terms of not extracting value really what were trying to do is clarify that we dont view relying on the fallbacks as a credible path to mitigation if it involves the transfer of value from bondholders to us thats not our intent here so we want to as i said a minute ago offer some form of the mediation exercise now obviously if holders choose not to take up that offer which they are obviously free to continue to do so under the existing terms our view given the current rate dynamics its probably not economically beneficial for them to do so but obviously thats a choice so thats really what we were trying to get across in that statement greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks fas and so the next question weve got comes from paul fenner so a number of questions paul so i might simplify this a little bit apologies so firstly in terms of at1 given your messaging and the capital levels is it just as likely that you do no issuance this year or will you do ph the two and also furthermore on hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 21feb2024 issuance how do you think about currencies for this year excluding us dollars how will you think about euros i guess specifically and finally on the loan to deposit ratio its incredibly low now at whats the right level and is there a strategy around this at all faisal yousaf a group treasurer hsbc investment bank plc okay thank you thanks for the question so on at1 actually let me take a step back for a minute just to talk about the overall issuance so as i said in my prepared notes on the senior holdco were expecting a pretty modest year and that is driven by averages borrowing demand but also what will be elevated cash position that we expect following the sale of canada on at1 what weve typically looking to do we did a little bit of prefinancing of our redemptions in so we did billion of the billion in and now were largely looking back and looking to move to a position where we fully replace any redeemed at1 so this year is probably a little bit different and given the excess cet1 position i expect to continue to look at the utility of any new issue and thats why weve guided to approximately billion well look at that call and well look at whether what else weve got in our cet1 position at the time on currencies so as i also said earlier that weve somewhat reduced our reliance last year on us dollar but us dollar is really very important to us its over its around about half perhaps a bit over in terms of our rwas thats us dollar and us dollar linked instruments that said we will look to diversify where levels are attractive we have our ring fenced bank which is almost exclusively a sterling balance sheet now im aware of the heightened spread levels in that market and thought for about how wed access the market given its fairly small but we will obviously look at sterling euro which was i think specifically your question will be another area we think very carefully about sing would be a third and perhaps a few other currencies so thats probably all i can offer at this point in time and then finally i think there was a comment about a loantodeposit ratio and yeah it is very healthy and we continue to look at that we have a healthy liquidity position as well in a number of our legal entities as you will have seen in the slide deck theres nothing i can share at this point in time in terms of changing that or target we dont have a particular target we are expecting loan demand to pick up later on in the year and well see how that plays out really greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks fas so weve had another submitted question from dan david at autonomous and so dan asks i think three questions here firstly on leverage can you comment on the increase in  in the european resolution group is this a sign of a longer term trend or shorter term on legacy do you have a target for the reduction in the amount outstanding in and specifically regarding the makewhole bonds that would be the tier would a basis point cut in central bank rates push the economics in your favor to take action faisal yousaf a group treasurer hsbc investment bank plc okay ill deal with the legacy one perhaps greg ill ask you to talk a bit about the leverage question so on legacy in terms of whether we have a target outstanding no not explicitly as i said earlier we maintain hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 21feb2024 continuous dialogue with the regulator and we are looking at options now but theres no target that i can share with you at this stage and on the 50basis points reduction it really depends on which securities one is looking at in some cases it could be beneficial in others not so much greg greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah sure so dan i dont think theres one specific thing i would point towards on the increase in leverage in the european business i think there is a few moving pieces so of course that the european resolution group houses are a nonring fenced bank which is a global booking center for our markets business so that will naturally flex up and down as we see opportunities and i wouldnt say ph and necessarily call out a longer term trend there at this stage the other one to bear in mind though is there is a bit of noise here so youll recall that the european unions required us to consolidate all of our european union businesses into underneath one subsidiary as the ipu that requirement came in at the end of the year we made a few transfers from outside of the european resolution group into the european resolution group which increased its notional assets at the same time so theres a few pieces there but nothing nothing id add specifically call out is driving it moving on so we have an anonymous question come in so fas would you mind walking us through the why we have a lower level of issuance this year and how confident you are in this negative net issuance for holdco senior specifically faisal yousaf a group treasurer hsbc investment bank plc yes sure okay perhaps ill start with just talking a little bit about what we did in so we had i was pretty happy with where we ended up in actually we had ph an over issuance plan for senior holdco of billion to billion which we communicated at the beginning of the year we landed at about billion so the lower end of the range and as i said earlier about of that was us or so was euro and the west sterling and other currencies for tier we have a issuance plan of billion to billion that we communicated at the beginning of ended up at around billion and then for at1 it was billion and billion so happy in and as the questionnaire has widely observed it is more modest this year and really we have a pretty good degree of confidence actually in the plans that we have there are uncertainties nevertheless in terms of if loan demand picks up that might prompt us to change obviously its somewhat contingent on us concluding some of our disposals this year as well canada in particular but really on the senior holdco what were saying is up to billion in terms of the plan this year and that as you will have had compares to now im expecting us to sorry and that makes us a net negative ph issuer then in the senior holdco im expecting us to return to more levels in so this year is probably somewhat unusual in our thinking so thats on senior holdco which i think was a question but actually just for completeness i mentioned a little bit about tier and at1 tier likely to be billion to billion this year and thats probably the runway on a go forward basis and then at1 as i said earlier its probably likeforlike in terms of as we call well look to replace and we dont necessarily need to prefund in order to replace but we will probably go along those kind of lines hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 21feb2024 greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks fas so weve had another question come in but just to flag it if you do want to ask a question over the line please do raise your hand and well open you up so this comes in from lee street at citi lee asks you highlight the billion of mainland china exposure but the bank also has a lot of other real estate exposure to hong kong and china please can you give us some color on what is happening generically with those exposures and why they are seen differently and secondly lee also asks the ph mrel buffer is is billion why is that buffer so high and what level could you realistically envisage reducing that number down to faisal yousaf a group treasurer hsbc investment bank plc okay thanks lee i was expecting you actually to call in so thank you for the question anyway so there is a slide in our deck i think is around in the fixed income that page says probably in the appendices which breaks our commercial real estate exposure yearonyear and i think the things id call out are that on a fullyear basis weve reduced the overall cre exposure by around from memory so its now about billion around the world the kind of areas that i would perhaps zoom in on and focus on is hong kong and we have reduced those numbers from billion down to billion so around reduction and when you drill into that detail if one of the reasons we look at this differently is that is not necessarily residential mortgages as you would see in the china cre space it could be office or other types of commercial real estate retail et cetera the office exposure that we have was around down in and is down i think around versus our peak which is around about so weve reduced that exposure somewhat and we remain comfortable with it actually theres nothing i would call out in terms of a worry there at this point also in the us we have made substantial reductions in i think that may have been commented on earlier in the day and thats come down to just under billion so down about in terms of our cre i would also draw your attention on the same slide slide to our ltv analysis which shows that in hong kong the ltv 70pluspercent of our ltv is less than and in the uk similarly we have a very healthy ltv position so thats all i think very positive now on the second part of your question if i recall correctly you were talking about the billion the majority of that is cet1 and we have a prudent buffer in place there are obviously regulatory constraints there but were confident about those debt buffers i guess thats probably all id comment on but greg perhaps id welcome you to make any comments you have greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah so i guess you know that the majority is cet1 so as you can imagine given the mda level is and were operating at the bulk of that ph mrel buffer is in cet1 so its going to largely follow that track and i think elsewhere were broadly comfortable with those buffers and so we have a call coming in off the line of ph phil fuller from decker ph phil your line is open hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 21feb2024 q hello can you hear me greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc hi ph phil q yeah so my question around this quarter youve published lots of negatives with bank of communications and so on do you think now everything negative is like off the table or will these stories these negative stories like on china cre provisions and bank of communications and argentina and so on will they continue in the next quarters greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc hi ph phil so i mean its always going to be very very hard to predict these items but i think yeah certainly unfortunate the significant numbers of oneoffs that did come through the results in  and of course wed hope that its a smaller number in future and there were a number of quarters in that were pretty clean actually so yeah its unfortunate that they all came through in  made it understandably difficult to pick through and in terms of the bocom impairment weve been doing that calculation on a quarterly basis for a very long time effectively the fact that the market value of our ownership is below our carrying value is an indicator that we need to do an impairment test its simply that weve got to the point in that impairment test that its crystallized a billion loss well continue to do those tests in the coming quarters as long as it is necessary for us to do so and of course we couldnt rule out further impairments but theres nothing ph to add at this stage and argentina hyperinflation that has been feature for a long time in our results but its been relatively minor what you saw in  was a very significant devaluation in the peso which accelerated a significant volume of that into  at the adjustment into  and of course that will again its out of our control to the extent that a further adjustment is necessary that will be determined by the how the currency moves and the inflation in argentina but yes wed love to see as many clean quarters as we can in future q and a second question if i may faisal yousaf a group treasurer hsbc investment bank plc phil just before you do i just wanted to add to that add to gregs response i would comment that the adjustment that was made as greg has indicated is a technical accounting adjustment and it had no impact on cet1 ratio no impact on our dividends and overall as youve heard already i mean theres a very positive story in terms of our dividends and payouts for i should also say as was said in the call it this morning it doesnt change our hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 21feb2024 strategy to mainland china theres no impacts on our strategic relationship with bocom and no impact on hsbc or bocoms operations or strategic outlook it is purely an accounting calculation the viu test the valueinuse test which were mandated to do on a quarterly basis and were not expecting or anticipating any further adjustments at this stage q thank you and just one last question if i may faisal yousaf a group treasurer hsbc investment bank plc sure q your the holdco bonds that you issued the holdco seniors do you account them at fair value still so that you might need to more or less depending on where rates go faisal yousaf a group treasurer hsbc investment bank plc yes we do we account for them at fair value we know that we take a conservative approach for our mrel and capital stack we believe thats the right way to value these instruments albeit there are a variety of practices and that we know that the regulators are looking at this with welcome clarity but we use fair value to value them greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah and just to add to that ph phil just to finalize that i know that this has been a headwind to us in previous years in it was actually a tailwind so some of that negative marktomarket that we accrued through the regulatory ratios in did come back to some extent particularly in the fourth quarter so all in its probably benefited us by billion billion id say at this stage but of course that will always be dependent on the path of rates and how that changes faisal yousaf a group treasurer hsbc investment bank plc yeah ive got in the back of my mind that we were at ph negative value at one stage and were as at year end greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc thats right fas yeah and so weve had thanks for your question ph phil weve had another question in from iuliana golub from goldman sachs iuliana asks can you please comment on the mexican business cost of risk outlook for it looks like a fairly high charge in  for the unsecured consumer book and ill take that so yeah look were growing that business so as we grow that business theres two things to think about so firstly growing arguably at a higher risk booked than we typically originate around the rest of the hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript  earnings call fixed income 21feb2024 group given mexican unsecured business will generate meaningful stage and stage charges and we do that just because of the day one recognition in addition of course as we grow that book we will be fine tuning risk over time but the level of impairments that were generating in that business were comfortable with and is fully reflected in the pricing that were getting on the asset side so yes it is contributing and we are conscious of that and it is still a pretty small business in the grand scheme of things is certainly on the balance sheet side and youll see mexico still remains a relatively modest contributor to the loan book compared to its profit contributions but yes i think something we will continue to keep our eye on and i think that draws us to an end i think weve got through all the questions that have been so oh sorry weve got a question from ph rob thomas on the line ph rob your line is open q just to follow up on just argentina can you remind me what business you do there and what the importance of that business is for the group greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc so weve got a historic operation in argentina its a full service business albeit its got smaller in recent years i think particularly on the retail side and it does what most of our subsidiaries do around the world it provides part of our international network and is a broader largely corporate institutional business there q okay thanks greg case a headfixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc no problem so yeah i think thats all the questions all the questions we have so fas i just hand it back to you if you want to wrap up faisal yousaf group treasurer hsbc investment bank plc okay thank you thank you everyone for your time today and for joining us i hope you found the call useful if you do have further questions please do pick up with greg and the ir team and we are looking forward to seeing some of you when we are on the road over the next few weeks and months thank you very much and have a
