item risk factors table start table end the following discussion provides a description of the most significant risk factors that could affect our businesses results of operations and financial condition and could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in public statements or documents some of these risk factors are inherent in the financial services industry and others are more specific to our own businesses there are also other factors besides those discussed below or elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k that could affect our businesses results of operations and financial condition and therefore the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of all potential risks that we may face risks related to the economy financial markets liquidity and interest rates market and economic conditions will continue to affect our businesses results of operations and financial condition our business and earnings are affected by general business economic and market conditions in the us and abroad given our concentration of business activities in the united states we are particularly exposed to downturns in the economy including housing high unemployment the availability of credit and liquidity and reduced economic growth while the us economy continued its recovery in the impact of the covid19 pandemic and higher inflation on economic conditions both in the united states and abroad continues to create global uncertainty about the future economic environment general business economic and market conditions that could continue to affect us include level of economic growth including the pace and magnitude of such growth pressure on and changes in consumer and business confidence spending and behavior fiscal policy volatility in energy prices including oil and gas prices volatility in credit markets unemployment levels wage income levels and declines in wealth trends in corporate earnings market value of residential and commercial real estate throughout the united states inflation monetary supply and monetary policy fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets in which we fund our operations consequences of unexpected geopolitical events natural disasters climate change outbreaks of contagious disease such as coronavirus or acts of war or terrorism trade policy fluctuations in the value of the us dollar movements in shortterm and longterm interest rates or a change in the shape of the yield curve increases in interest rates which may lead to increased delinquencies and loan impairment charges availability of liquidity availability of credit and new laws regulations or regulatory and law enforcement initiatives the covid19 pandemic has resulted in disruption to business and economic activity as well as to the capital markets see the covid19 pandemic has had and continues to have a material impact on us and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview economic environment although the us economy continued to improve in if businesses were again to become cautious to hire layoff employees or reduce hours for employees losses could be significant in our consumer loans due to decreased consumer income which will impact demand for products and services offered by many of our commercial loan clients in addition ongoing domestic and global policy issues such as trade disputes and economic sanctions and the implications of those events will continue to impact the capital markets and trade as well as corporate earnings which also impacts our commercial loan performance the sustainability of the economic recovery will be determined by numerous variables including consumer sentiment energy prices credit market volatility employment levels and housing market conditions which will impact corporate earnings and the capital markets in the event economic conditions stop improving or become depressed and lead to another recession there would be a significant negative impact on delinquencies chargeoffs and losses in all loan portfolios with a corresponding impact on our results of operations t he inflationary outlook remains uncertain the consumer price index increased percent yearoveryear in december the risks to our business from inflation depends on the durability of the current inflationary pressures transitory increases in inflation are unlikely to have a material impact on our business or earnings more persistent inflation however could lead to table start hsbc usa inc table end tighterthan expected monetary policy that in turn could increase the borrowing costs of our customers making it more difficult for them to repay their loans or other obligations the higher interest rates needed to tame persistent price pressures could also push down asset prices and weaken economic activity a deterioration in business and economic conditions may erode consumer and investor confidence increase volatility of financial markets and could also adversely affect our feebased businesses including financial planning products and services the covid19 pandemic has had and continues to have a material impact on us in march the united states declared a federal state of emergency in response to the covid19 pandemic the outbreak of this virus has disrupted global financial markets and negatively affected supply and demand across a broad range of industries there are a number of factors associated with the outbreak and its impact on global economies including the united states that have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on among other things the profitability capital and liquidity of financial institutions such as husi the pandemic will continue to impact our business in future periods the covid19 pandemic has caused disruption to our customers suppliers and staff covid19s effects in the us and globally have been extreme and the duration of the pandemic and its ultimate repercussions continue to remain unclear a number of states in which we operate previously implemented restrictions on their populations significantly impacting economic activity in those states and resulted in the temporary closure of many businesses while governments began to ease and in many cases remove these restrictions in the late spring and summer of they began to reinstate some of these restrictions during the fourth quarter in response to a significant surge in infections driven by the delta variant and the emergence of the omicron variant which could further impact economic activity as a result the demand for our products and services has been and may continue to be significantly impacted and could vary by region or industry sector furthermore it is unclear how the macroeconomic business environment or societal norms may be impacted after the pandemic the postcovid19 environment may undergo unexpected developments or changes in the financial markets fiscal tax and regulatory environments as well as customer and corporate client behavior which could have an adverse impact on our business in the united states unprecedented government economic intervention including additional government support enacted during the first quarter of has likely dampened some of the pandemics effects but at uncertain longterm costs how the federal governments actions including rolling back any of their interventions will ultimately impact our customers and therefore the impact on husi remains uncertain furthermore it is unclear how these actions will impact the future economic environment including rising inflation interest rates and foreign exchange and our business the actions taken by the federal government and the frb may indicate a view on the potential severity of a downturn and post recovery environment which from a commercial regulatory and risk perspective could be significantly different to past crises and persist for a prolonged period unprecedented movement in economic and market drivers related to the covid19 pandemic dramatically impact the performance of financial models including retail and wholesale credit loss models capital models traded risk models and models used in the assetliability management process this has required more ongoing monitoring and more frequent testing of models particularly for credit loss models it also has resulted in the use of compensating controls for model limitations such as adjustments to model outputs to reflect consideration of management judgment by their nature such compensating controls require a significant degree of management judgment and assumptions to be applied and there is a risk that actual resultsperformance may differ from such judgments and assumptions the performance and usage of models will continue to be affected by the impact of new variants due to the continued uncertainty the full magnitude of change required to our models is evolving efforts are underway to recalibrate capital credit risk and other models and in some cases replace with alternative models interest rates have been reduced since the start of the covid19 pandemic which has and may continue to compress our margins and reduce our net interest income until interest rates return to higher levels mismatches between supply and demand of goods and services contributed to a rise in inflation in prompting the frb to announce the approaching end of the period of extraordinarily low interest rates federal and state legislative and regulatory developments in relation to covid19 have also impacted and may continue to impact our business and operations by for example requiring forbearance on loans suspensions of foreclosure sales and imposing restrictions on our ability to charge certain fees our participation in these and other measures taken by governments and regulatory authorities could result in potential increased fraud risk as well as reputational harm and may result in litigation including class actions or regulatory and government actions and proceedings such actions may result in judgments settlements penalties and fines adverse to husi any and all such events mentioned above could have or continue to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations prospects liquidity capital position and credit ratings including further credit rating agency changes of outlooks or ratings the extent of such impact will depend on the outcome of certain developments including but not limited to the duration of the pandemic including the emergence of new variants as well as its continuing impact on our customers vendors and employees all of which are uncertain economic growth is expected to slow in to more table start hsbc usa inc table end sustainable rates contingent on among other things the successful mitigation of negative impacts of the virus to the extent the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition it could also have the effect of increasing the likelihood of many of the other risks described in this annual report on form 10k increased credit risk including as a result of a deterioration in economic conditions could require us to increase our provision for credit losses and allowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition the credit performance of our loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results and condition if the current economic environment were to deteriorate further more of our customers may have difficulty in repaying their loans or other obligations which could result in a higher level of credit losses and provision for credit losses we reserve for credit losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings the amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in our various loan and other portfolios carried at amortized cost as well as offbalance sheet credit exposures such as undrawn commitments to lend the process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition it requires difficult subjective and complex judgments about the future including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans we might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions including falling home prices and higher unemployment lower us gross domestic product gdp estimates or other factors for example changes in borrower behavior or the regulatory environment also could influence recognition of credit losses in the portfolio and our allowance for credit losses while we believe that our allowance for credit losses was appropriate at december there is no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses in the event of a deterioration in economic conditions we may be required to increase reserves in future periods which would reduce our earnings federal reserve board policies can significantly affect business and economic conditions and as a result our financial results and condition the frb regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states its policies determine in large part our borrowing costs and the return we earn on loans and investments both of which affect our net interest margin they also can materially affect the value of financial instruments we hold such as debt securities and derivative instruments the frbs policies also can affect our borrowers potentially increasing the risk that such borrowers may fail to repay their loans changes in frb policies are beyond our control and can be hard to predict risks related to regulation legislation and litigation federal state local and other similar international measures to regulate the financial industry may significantly impact our operations we operate in a highly regulated environment changes in federal state and local laws and regulations affecting banking derivatives capital liquidity consumer credit bankruptcy privacy consumer protection or other matters could materially impact our operations and performance attempts by local state and federal regulatory agencies to address perceived problems with the mortgage lending and credit card industries could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including limiting the types of products we can offer how these products may be originated the fees and charges that may be applied to accounts and how accounts may be collected or security interests enforced any one or more of these effects could negatively impact our results there is also significant focus on loss mitigation and foreclosure activity for real estate loans we cannot fully anticipate the response by national regulatory agencies state attorneys general or certain legislators nor can we anticipate whether significant changes to our operations and practices will be required as a result the doddfrank act established the cfpb which has broad authority to regulate providers of credit payment and other consumer financial products and services in addition provisions of the doddfrank act may narrow the scope of federal preemption of state consumer laws and expand the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation as a result of the doddfrank acts potential expansion of the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation we could potentially be subject to additional state lawsuits and enforcement actions thereby further increasing our legal and compliance costs under the doddfrank act certain of our affiliates and subsidiaries including hsbc bank usa have provisionally registered as swap dealers and are subject to extensive oversight by the cftc regulation of swap dealers by the cftc imposes numerous corporate governance business conduct capital margin reporting clearing execution and other regulatory requirements on hsbc bank usa additionally certain of our affiliates and subsidiaries including hsbc bank usa have conditionally registered as securitybased swap dealers and became subject to extensive oversight by the sec including the imposition of parallel corporate governance business conduct reporting and other regulatory requirements for securitybased swaps imposition of these requirements may adversely affect our derivatives business and make us less competitive or make certain derivative products less profitable to undertake the volcker rule limits the ability of banking entities such as husi to sponsor or invest in certain private equity or hedge funds or engage in certain types of proprietary trading see regulation and competition the volcker rule table start hsbc usa inc table end our parent hsbc north america is subject to assessment by the frb as part of the ccar and dfast programs which includes supervisory stress tests conducted by the frb see regulation and competition capital planning and stress testing the total impact of the doddfrank act and related legislative and regulatory initiatives cannot be fully assessed without taking into consideration how nonus policymakers and regulators may respond through the promulgation of new regulations and revisions to existing regulations and how the cumulative effects of both us and nonus laws and regulations will affect our businesses and operations additional legislative or regulatory actions in the united states the uk the european union eu and in other countries could result in a significant loss of revenue limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in which we might otherwise consider engaging affect the value of assets that we hold require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demand for our products impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our businesses accordingly any such new or additional legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on our businesses results of operations or financial condition furthermore certain large gsibs including hsbc have in recent years become subject to capital surcharges and other enhanced prudential requirements in the financial stability board fsb identified hsbc as one of three gsibs subject to a percent surcharge the frbs rules implementing the gsib surcharge in the united states do not impose additional capital requirements on us because the us gsib surcharge only applies to the eight largest us banking organizations our ultimate parent hsbc is subject to the fsbs tlac requirements for gsibs in the uk the tlac standard also permits authorities in host jurisdictions to require internal tlac to be issued by local entities to either parent entities or third parties the purpose of the tlac standard is to ensure that gsibs have sufficient lossabsorbing and recapitalization capacity available to implement an orderly resolution with continuity of critical functions and minimal impact on financial stability and to ensure cooperation between home and host authorities during resolution the frbs rules implementing the fsbs tlac standard require the us ihcs of nonus gsibs including hsbc north america to maintain minimum amounts of tlac and a related tlac buffer to support compliance with the tlac rules hsbc north america has issued longterm debt and may be required to issue additional longterm debt in future periods see regulation and competition tlac the delivery of our priorities is subject to execution risk effective management of transformation projects is required to effectively deliver our strategic priorities involving delivering both on externally driven programs regulatory requirements and benchmark rate transition as well as key business initiatives to deliver revenue growth product enhancement and operational efficiency outcomes see failure to effectively implement our business strategies may adversely affect our financial performance regulatory requests legal matters and business initiatives all require a significant amount of time and resources to implement the magnitude complexity and at times concurrent demands of projects has resulted in heightened execution risk organizational change and external factors including the challenging macroeconomic environment and the extent and pace of regulatory change also contribute to execution risk these factors could adversely affect the successful delivery of our priorities uncertainty surrounding the potential legal regulatory and policy changes by the current administration in the us may directly impact financial institutions and the global economy we continue to assess the potential impact the change in administrations may have on financial and economic markets and on our business changes by the current administration in federal policy and regulatory agencies could lead to changes involving the level of oversight and focus on the financial services industry as well as changes to the tax code the nature timing and economic and political effects of potential future changes to the current legal and regulatory framework and tax code affecting financial institutions remain highly uncertain it is unclear what additional laws regulations and policies may change and whether future changes or uncertainty surrounding future changes will adversely affect our operating environment and therefore our results of operations and financial condition lawsuits and regulatory investigations and proceedings may continue and increase in the current economic and regulatory environment hsbc usa and its affiliates are routinely named as defendants in or as parties to various legal actions investigations and proceedings relating to our current andor former operations and are subject to governmental and regulatory examinations informationgathering requests investigations and formal and informal proceedings as described in note litigation and regulatory matters in the accompanying consolidated financial statements which may result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties remediation payments injunctions and other relief legal actions and proceedings including investigations may increase in the near future especially in the event of a resurgent recession financial service providers are at risk of regulatory sanctions or fines related to conduct of business and financial crime the incidence of regulatory proceedings and other adversarial proceedings against financial service firms is increasing with a corresponding increase also in civil litigation arising from or relating to issues which are subject to regulatory investigations sanctions or fines there may be additional regulatory investigations and reviews conducted by banking and other regulators including the cfpb cftc sec state attorneys general or state regulatory and law enforcement agencies that if determined adversely may result in judgments settlements substantial fines penalties remediation payments or other results including additional compliance requirements which could materially adversely affect our businesses financial condition or results of table start hsbc usa inc table end operations or cause serious reputational harm in addition hsbcs extensive global operations increase our compliance and regulatory risks and costs for example operations in emerging markets including facilitating crossborder transactions on behalf of its clients subjects us to higher compliance risks under us regulations primarily focused on various aspects of global corporate activities including aml laws and regulations the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and economic sanctions programs administered by the office of foreign assets control these risks can be more acute in less developed markets and thus require substantial investment in compliance infrastructure or could result in a reduction in certain of our affiliates business activities criminal prosecutions of financial institutions for among other alleged conduct breaches of aml laws and regulations the fcpa or economic sanctions programs antitrust violations market manipulation aiding and abetting tax evasion and providing unlicensed crossborder banking services have become more commonplace and may increase in frequency due to increased media attention and higher expectations from prosecutors and the public any such prosecution or investigation of or legal proceeding or regulatory action brought against hsbc or one or more of its subsidiaries could result in substantial fines penalties andor forfeitures and could have a material adverse effect on our results business and prospects including the potential loss of key licenses requirement to exit certain businesses and withdrawal of funding from depositors and other stakeholders we establish reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated however we may incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not established a reserve for it and the cost of resolving a matter may be substantially higher than amounts reserved for it it is inherently difficult to predict the outcome of our legal regulatory and other adversarial proceedings particularly cases in which matters are brought on behalf of various classes of claimants those which seek unspecified damages or those which involve novel legal claims the resolution of a pending legal proceeding could materially adversely affect our business reputation results of operations and financial condition regulatory requirements in the us and in nonus jurisdictions to facilitate the future orderly resolution of large financial institutions could negatively impact our business structures activities and practices the doddfrank act requires hsbc as a foreign bank holding company and our ultimate parent to regularly prepare and submit a sifi plan see regulation and competition regulatory capital and liquidity requirements if the frb and the fdic both determine that a sifi plan is not credible which although not defined is generally believed to mean the regulators do not believe the plans are feasible or would otherwise allow resolution of a financial institutions us businesses in a way that protects systemically important functions without severe systemic disruption and without exposing taxpayers to loss and the deficiencies are not remedied within the required time period an institution including hsbc could be required to restructure or reorganize businesses legal entities or operational systems and intracompany transactions in ways that could negatively impact operations or be subject to restrictions on growth hsbc could also eventually be subjected to more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or be required to divest certain assets or operations in the bank of england boe and the prudential regulation authority pra published final policies on the resolvability assessment framework raf which places the onus on firms to demonstrate their own resolvability and is designed to increase transparency and accountability for resolution planning in order to be considered resolvable hsbc must meet three outcomes i have adequate resources in resolution ii be able to continue business through resolution and restructuring and iii be able to coordinate its resolution and communicate effectively with stakeholders the raf requires hsbc to prepare a report on the hsbc groups assessment of its resolvability which must be submitted to the pra on a biennial basis hsbc submitted its first such report to the pra in october and will publish a public summary of the report in june the boe will similarly publish a statement concerning the resolvability of hsbc at the same time under the raf hsbc has assessed resolvability both from a ukfocused and a groupwide perspective and has implemented common resolvability capabilities across the groups significant entities including material entities in its us group hsbc continues to engage with the boe pra frb fdic and its global regulators in other jurisdictions to ensure that it meets current and future recovery and resolution requirements and could face regulatory penalties if these requirements are not met us federal banking agencies may increase regulatory capital tlac longterm debt or liquidity requirements which could require hsbc north america or hsbc bank usa to issue additional qualifying securities or to take other actions such as liquidate assets hsbc north america and hsbc bank usa are required to meet consolidated regulatory capital and liquidity requirements including new or modified regulations and related regulatory guidance in accordance with current regulatory timelines in the current regulatory environment capital and liquidity requirements are frequently introduced and amended our regulators may increase regulatory minimum or buffer requirements change how regulatory capital is calculated or increase liquidity requirements a significant component of regulatory capital ratios is calculating our riskweighted assets and our leverage exposure which may increase the basel committee has also revised several key methodologies for measuring riskweighted assets these revisions include changes to the standardized approach for credit risk and operational risk constraints on the use of internal models a capital floor based on the revised standardized approaches and a final standard on the minimum capital requirements for market risk the federal banking agencies have indicated they intend to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking table start hsbc usa inc table end in to update the us basel iii rule to incorporate the basel committee revisions these and other future regulatory or legislative proposals could significantly impact the regulatory capital standards and requirements applicable to financial institutions such as hsbc north america as well as our ability to meet these requirements increases in regulatory capital may also be required in response to other us supervisory requirements participation by hsbc north america in the frbs ccar stress test process also requires that hsbc north america maintain sufficient capital to meet minimum regulatory ratios under multiple forwardlooking stress scenarios across a ninequarter planning horizon the frb has also adopted a final rule on the scb which among other things replaced the fixed capital conservation buffer with a dynamic institutionspecific riskbased scb for ccar firms such as hsbc north america see regulation and competition capital planning and stress testing these stress testing requirements will influence our regulatory capital and liquidity planning process and may impose additional operational and compliance costs on us preparation for the us implementation of the basel committees revisions to basel iii has influenced and is likely to continue to influence our regulatory capital and liquidity planning process and is expected to impose additional operational and compliance costs on us we are unable at this time to determine the extent of changes we will need to make to our liquidity or capital position if any and what effect if any such changes will have on our results of operations or financial condition new regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital and may require us to increase our capital or liquidity any requirement that we increase our regulatory capital regulatory capital ratios or liquidity could require us to liquidate assets or otherwise change our business andor investment plans which may negatively affect our financial results changes to and compliance with the regulatory capital and liquidity requirements may impact our operations by requiring us to liquidate assets increase borrowings issue additional equity or other securities cease or alter certain operations sell company assets or hold highly liquid assets which may adversely affect our results of operations failure to meet regulatory requirements and expectations regarding sales practices and incentive compensation programs could negatively impact us and our customers our remuneration practices and performance management framework are designed to prevent and deter conflicts of interest and inappropriate sales incentives additionally our other sales controls including our framework for handling customer and employee complaints regarding sales practices are designed to ensure customers receive products that they have authorized and meet their needs failure to execute our sales controls could result in the sale of or upgrade to products and services that fail to meet the needs of or are unsuitable for customers and clients and can lead to financial harm to our customers regulatory sanctions financial loss and reputational damage we are subject to taxrelated risks we are subject to the various tax laws of the us and its states and municipalities in which we operate these tax laws are inherently complex and we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these laws to the hsbc north america entities operations and businesses our interpretations and application of the tax laws could differ from that of the relevant governmental taxing authority which could result in the potential for the payment of additional taxes penalties or interest which could be material additionally the amounts ultimately paid may differ materially from the amounts provided depending on the ultimate resolution of the matter risks related to our business operations governance and internal control systems our reputation may have a direct impact on our financial results and ongoing operations our ability to attract and retain customers and employees and conduct business transactions with our counterparties could be adversely affected to the extent our reputation or the reputation of affiliates operating under the hsbc brand is damaged reputational risk relates to stakeholders perceptions whether factbased or otherwise stakeholders expectations change constantly and so reputational risk is dynamic and varies between geographical regions groups and individuals any material lapse in standards of integrity compliance customer service or operating efficiency may represent a potential reputational risk our failure to address or to appear to fail to address various issues that could give rise to reputational risk could cause harm to us and our business prospects reputational issues include but are not limited to negative news about us hsbc our affiliates or the financial services industry generally ethical issues including potential conflicts of interest and the acceptance or receipt of gifts and entertainment as well as potential violations under the fcpa compliance with legal and regulatory requirements alleged deceptive or unfair lending or pricing practices compliance with aml and economic sanctions programs fraud and misappropriation of assets privacy and data security intrusions related to our customers or employees cybersecurity issues and cyber incidents whether actual threatened or perceived recordkeeping table start hsbc usa inc table end sales and trading practices customer service actions of a vendor or other third party including a subcontractor with whom we do business the proper identification of the legal credit liquidity operational and market risks inherent in our businesses alleged irregularities in servicing foreclosure consumer collections mortgage lending practices and loan modifications a downgrade of or negative watch warning on any of our credit ratings and general company performance the proliferation of social media websites as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others including personal blogs and social network profiles facilitates communication with large audiences in short time frames these social media websites also may increase the risk that negative inappropriate or unauthorized information may be posted or released publicly that could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences including as a result of our employees interacting with our customers in an unauthorized manner in various social media outlets the failure to address or the perception that we have failed to address any of these issues appropriately could make our customers unwilling to do business with us or give rise to increased regulatory action which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations our risk management measures may not be successful risks have the potential to affect the results of our operations or financial condition the management of risk is an integral part of all our activities and is fundamental to the delivery of our strategic priorities while we are subject to a number of legal and regulatory actions and investigations our risk management framework has been designed to provide robust controls and ongoing monitoring of our principal risks to manage risk we employ a risk management framework at all levels and across all risk types the framework fosters the continuous monitoring of the risk environment and an integrated evaluation of risks and their interactions it also strives to ensure that we have a robust and consistent approach to risk management across all of our activities while our risk management framework employs a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques such techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every unfavorable event or the specifics and timing of every outcome failure to manage risks appropriately could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations our risk management measures may face particularly significant challenges in the following three broad areas a macroeconomic and geopolitical risks unfavorable economic and market conditions may adversely affect our results b risks related to our businesses business operations governance and internal systems the delivery of our strategic priorities is subject to execution risk and we may not achieve all the expected benefits of our strategic initiatives our operations are subject to the threat of fraudulent activity and disruption from the external environment we are highly dependent on our information technology systems we could incur losses or be required to hold additional capital as a result of model limitations or failure issues with the quality of data or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedures could result in ineffective risk management practices or inaccurate risk reporting c regulatory and legal risks to our businesses we are subject to a number of legal and regulatory actions and investigations the outcomes of which are inherently difficult to predict unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and brand unfavorable legislative or regulatory developments or changes in the policy of regulators or governments could also have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition and prospects failure to effectively implement our business strategies may adversely affect our financial performance our business strategy is described under the heading managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview events implementation of our business strategy will require significant time and require us to incur significant expense see note strategic initiatives in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further detail the actual costs and time required may exceed our estimates additionally implementation of our business strategy will affect our employees customers and other stakeholders and could adversely impact our relationships with stakeholders and our reputation our strategies for business growth include focusing our sales efforts on international connectivity strategies with high quality international corporate clients and globallyconnected affluent and high net worth wealth and personal clients as well as augmenting our returns through increased crossselling and cost optimization we may fail to attract international clients or crosssell our services to them competition within the industry can limit our ability to sell more products to our customers or influence us to sell our products at lower prices reducing our net interest income and revenue from our feebased products our crosssell strategy is also dependent on earning more business from our customers and increasing our crosssell ratio or the average number of products sold to existing customers which may become more challenging our international corporate table start hsbc usa inc table end strategies are dependent on a stable geopolitical environment increased tensions or instability between trading nations and the adoption of protectionist trade policies could adversely affect our ability to obtain new business from existing clients substantial work is required to execute on our growth strategies alongside the strategic actions we continue to implement a number of externally driven regulatory remediation programs the magnitude and complexity of the projects required to meet these demands has resulted in heightened execution risk additionally we may be unable to fully realize the cost optimization efforts and the other anticipated benefits from those efforts and we may not be able to realize them in the currently anticipated timeframes the cumulative impact of the collective change initiatives underway is significant and has direct implications on resourcing and our people failure to successfully implement our business strategies may have a material adverse effect on our businesses prospects financial condition and results of operations our inability to meet funding requirements due to deposit attrition or access to the capital markets hsbc usa is a holding company without operations of its own and therefore relies on dividends and other distributions for a portion of its funding and liquidity federal and state laws limit the amount of dividends and distributions that our subsidiaries may pay our primary source of funding is deposits augmented by issuance of commercial paper and term debt adequate liquidity is critical to our ability to operate our businesses we also access wholesale markets in order to provide funding for entities that do not accept deposits to align asset and liability maturities and currencies and to maintain a market presence we issued a total of million of longterm debt at various points in an inability to obtain financing in the unsecured longterm or shortterm debt capital markets because of market factors or factors in our businesses could have a substantial adverse effect on our liquidity unfavorable macroeconomic developments market disruptions or regulatory developments may increase our funding costs or challenge our ability to raise funds to support our businesses materially adversely affecting our businesses prospects financial condition andor results of operations future conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include an inability to maintain stable deposit balances because customers may invest in other financial instruments as an alternative diminished access to capital markets because of market factors or factors in our businesses an increased interest rate environment for our commercial paper deposits or term debt unforeseen cash or capital requirements an inability to sell assets and an inability to obtain expected funding from hsbc group subsidiaries and through deposits these conditions could be caused by a number of factors including internal and external factors such as among others financial and credit market disruption volatility or lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets lack of market or customer confidence in hsbc or negative news about hsbc or the financial services industry generally and other conditions and factors over which we have little or no control including economic conditions in the united states and abroad and concerns over potential government defaults and related policy initiatives our approach is to meet our capital needs locally through activities which reduce risk to the extent however that local alternatives are insufficient as a whollyowned subsidiary of hsbc we would seek their support hsbc has provided us with capital support in the past notwithstanding if we are unable to maintain stable deposit balances andor raise funds in the capital markets our liquidity position could be adversely affected and we might be unable to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at their contractual maturity to repay borrowings as they mature or to fund new loans investments and businesses we may need to liquidate unencumbered assets to meet our liabilities in a time of reduced liquidity we may be unable to sell some of our assets or we may need to sell assets at depressed prices which in either case could materially adversely affect our businesses prospects results of operations andor financial condition we face significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry we compete with other financial institutions in a highly competitive industry that continues to undergo significant change as a result of financial regulatory reform and increased public scrutiny stemming from the financial crisis and the challenging economic conditions that followed we target globallyconnected clients who need sophisticated global solutions and we generally compete on the basis of the quality of our customer service the wide variety of products and services that we can offer our customers and the ability of those products and services to satisfy our customers needs the extensive distribution channels available for our customers our innovation and our reputation continued or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may table start hsbc usa inc table end negatively affect our market share and results of operations andor cause us to increase our capital investment in our businesses in order to remain competitive additionally our products and services may not be accepted by our targeted clients given the current economic regulatory and political environment for large financial institutions such as us and possible public backlash to bank fees and the emergence of new products and fintech companies there is increased competitive pressure to provide products and services at current or lower prices consequently our ability to reposition or reprice our products and services from time to time may be limited and could be influenced significantly by the actions of our competitors who may or may not charge similar fees for their products and services any changes in the types of products and services that we offer our customers andor the pricing for those products and services could result in a loss of customers and market share and could materially adversely affect our results of operations further new entrants to the market or new technologies could require us to spend more to modify or adapt our products to attract and retain customers continued technological advances and the growth of ecommerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions as well as other companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions including electronic payment solutions we may not respond effectively to these competitive threats from existing and new competitors and may be forced to increase our investment in our businesses to modify or adapt our existing products and services or develop new products and services to respond to our customers needs any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our businesses prospects financial condition and results of operations adverse changes in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our borrowing costs and liquidity our credit ratings are an important part of maintaining our liquidity we depend on access to the securities market for a portion of our funding our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies which consider a number of factors including their assessment of our relative financial strength and results of operations including our strategy and our managements capability as well as factors affecting the financial services industry

risks relating to documentation changes for new products including appropriately detailing the risks and complexity of new interest rate conventions and the transition of legacy contracts to alternate

financial institutions that fail to comply with regulatory reporting requirements or with principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting as set out by the basel committee may face supervisory measures any of these failures could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and results of operations we have significant exposure to counterparty risk and the financial condition of our clients and counterparties could adversely affect us we are exposed to counterparties that are involved in virtually all major industries and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in financial services including brokers and dealers central clearing counterparties commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty or client significant deterioration in the credit quality of a counterparty may lead to concerns about the credit quality of others in the same industry exacerbating our credit risk exposure and increasing losses including marktomarket losses in our marketmaking and clearing businesses our ability to engage in routine transactions to fund our operations and manage our risks could be materially adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial services institutions financial institutions are necessarily interdependent because of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships as a consequence a default by or decline in market confidence in individual institutions or anxiety about the financial services industry generally can lead to further individual andor systemic difficulties defaults and losses table start hsbc usa inc table end mandatory central clearing of over the counter derivatives including under the doddfrank act brings with it risk as a clearing member we have financial exposure for losses incurred at a central counterparty ccp by the default of other clearing members hence increased moves toward central clearing brings with it a further element of interconnectedness between clearing members and clients that we believe may increase rather than reduce our exposure to systemic risk at the same time our ability to manage such risk ourselves will be reduced because risk controls are largely managed by the ccps themselves and it is unclear at present how at a time of stress regulators and resolution authorities would intervene in situations in which we strive to mitigate counterparty risk by taking collateral our credit risk may remain high if the collateral we hold cannot be realized or must be liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of our exposure to the respective counterparty there is a risk that collateral cannot be realized including situations where this arises by change of law that may influence our ability to foreclose on collateral or otherwise enforce contractual rights significant or prolonged periods of market stress or illiquidity could further decrease our ability to realize the fair value of collateral held by us or make it more likely that we would liquidate collateral at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of our exposure to the respective counterparty or client further disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral significantly increase in times of market stress and illiquidity when such a counterparty or client becomes bankrupt or insolvent we may become involved in significant disputes or litigation with the counterpartys or clients bankruptcy estate and other creditors or involved in regulatory investigations each of which could increase our operational and litigation costs we also have credit exposure arising from risk defeasance products such as credit default swaps cdss and other credit derivatives each of which is carried at fair value the risk of default by counterparties to cdss and other credit derivatives used as mitigants affects the fair value of these instruments depending on the valuation and the perceived credit risk of the underlying instrument against which protection has been purchased any such adjustments or fair value changes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations failure to appropriately address potential conflicts of interest can result in reputational harm as well as litigation and enforcement actions our ability to appropriately address potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as our business activities encompass more transactions with and among our diversified client and customer base we can become subject to litigation and enforcement actions and our reputation can be damaged by the failure or perceived failure to adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest treat clients and customers with the appropriate standard of care and provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards a failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction litigation and regulatory fines penalties or other sanctions and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions all of which could adversely affect our businesses and reputation new customer privacy initiatives may impose additional operational burdens on us may limit our ability to pursue desirable business initiatives and increase the risks associated with any future use of customer data recent legislative and regulatory efforts to protect the privacy of consumer data limit how companies can use customer data and impose obligations on companies in their management of such data as a financial services company we necessarily gather maintain and use a significant amount of customer data other jurisdictions may adopt similar requirements that impose different and potentially inconsistent compliance burdens these initiatives particularly to the extent multiple jurisdictions adopt inconsistent requirements could increase compliance complexity and related costs result in significant financial penalties for compliance failures and limit our ability to develop new products or respond to technological changes they also could heighten the reputational impact of perceived misuses of customer data by us our vendors or others who gain unauthorized access to our customer data we could incur losses or be required to hold additional capital as a result of model limitations or failure we use models for a range of purposes in managing our businesses including regulatory capital calculations stress testing credit approvals financial crime and fraud risk management and financial reporting we could face adverse consequences as a result of decisions which may lead to actions by management based on models that are poorly developed implemented or used or as a result of the modeled outcome being misunderstood or the use of such information for purposes for which it was not designed we hold capital

relating to our financial statements management projections estimates and judgments based on historical performance may not be indicative of our future performance our management is required to use certain estimates in preparing our financial statements including accounting estimates to determine credit loss reserves deferred tax assets and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities including goodwill among other items in particular credit loss reserve estimates and certain asset and liability valuations such as goodwill are subject to managements judgment and actual results are influenced by factors outside our control to the extent historical averages are not predictive of future losses and management is unable to accurately evaluate the portfolio risk factors not fully reflected in its current loss estimate unexpected additional losses could result similarly to the extent assumptions employed in measuring fair value of assets and liabilities are not supported by market prices or other observable parameters do not sufficiently capture their inherent risk including management estimates of future cash flows used to determine the fair value of goodwill unexpected additional losses could result we are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to earnings if we determine based on available evidence at the time the determination is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance we estimate future taxable income based on management approved business plans future capital requirements and ongoing tax planning strategies this evaluation process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period the recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant judgments about future earnings the periods in which items will impact taxable income future corporate tax rates and the application of inherently complex tax laws the use of different estimates can result in changes in the amounts of deferred tax items recognized which can result in equity and earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings see note income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
