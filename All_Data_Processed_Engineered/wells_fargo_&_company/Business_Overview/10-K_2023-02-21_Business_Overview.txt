compete with financial services providers such as banks savings and loan associations credit unions finance companies mortgage banking companies insurance companies investment banks and mutual fund companies they also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses private equity firms and online lending companies as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may have lower cost structures securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business the financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services these technological advances may diminish
