a long list of challenges confronted wells fargo co chief executive charles scharf when he was brought in to restore the banks tarnished reputation in the year since his problems have only multiplied americas fourthlargest bank is in the grip of a recession that threatens to deliver steep loan losses nearzero interest rates are straining profit margins and the bank is still in hot water with regulators which imposed a growth cap as a result of the banks fouryearold fakeaccount scandal and the plethora of problems it exposed then there are the selfinflicted wounds mr scharf has drawn fire from employees and washington lawmakers for filling top jobs with a largely white largely male cadre of former colleagues and for saying there were few black candidates with the required experience for those positions the episode damaged morale within the bank especially among black staffers current and former employees said mr scharf had little room for error when he came to wells fargo last october from bank of new york mellon corp pledging to clean up a mess that started in its branches and spread to nearly every one of its businesses two ceos had already resigned after failing to convince washington regulators and lawmakers that the bank was on the mend as he heads into his second year on the job mr scharf finds himself in a position familiar to his predecessors playing defense mr scharf is focused on resolving important regulatory issues created by past misconduct putting the right leadership team in place and building an organizational foundation for wells fargos future success a spokeswoman said in a statement he and his team did this while also dealing with the negative impacts of the covid19 pandemic and providing support for our customers and communities when he became ceo mr scharf a onetime protege of jpmorgan chase co ceo james dimon acknowledged the mistakes of the past and swiftly attempted to remake the banks insular culture we need to be more direct with each other he said at his first employee town hall last fall he encouraged decisiveness he mandated more rigorous performance reviews in some corners of the bank people call him chainsaw charlie according to people inside the bank mr scharfs defenders said he is laying the groundwork for the companys rebound much of the progress they said is happening behind the scenes in the vast web of systems and technology that is meant to catch problems like the sales scandal he had some early wins in february the bank reached a billion settlement to end civil and criminal investigations tied to the sales scandal that had dogged the bank for years he testified before the house financial services committee the following month and unlike his predecessors emerged largely unscathed he raised minimum hourly pay in most of the banks us markets but has tested mr scharf in unexpected ways the coronavirus recession threw wells fargo for a loop the bank whose revenue has been falling for a few years reported its first loss since in the second quarter and slashed its dividend the bank like its peers has set aside billions of dollars to cover bad loans its stock has lost more than half of its value since the beginning of analysts polled by factset expect the bank to post a modest profit when it reports thirdquarter results next week but still lower than a year earlier mr scharf has imposed steep cost cuts to help the bank weather the downturn layoffs expected to ultimately number in the tens of thousands have set employees on edge job cuts often happen on tuesdays according to people familiar with the matter and a new policy instituted during mr scharfs tenure requires laidoff employees to leave immediately instead of in days most recently mr scharf was criticized for comments he made about the lack of black talent at the most senior levels of finance mr scharf has brought in new leadership consisting largely of white men he previously worked with in other finance jobs including at jpmorgan the bank meanwhile has lost some of its highestranking black female employees the charlotte observer recently reported as of last year wells fargos executives and senior managers were white and less than black according to company data in recent months mr scharf has hired three senior black executives two of whom serve on the banks powerful operating committee in a june memo committing to diversify the company and its senior ranks he asked that employees withhold judgment until after he had two years on the job to make progress the unfortunate reality is that there is a very limited pool of black talent to recruit from with this specific experience he said referring to the expertise needed to manage wells fargos regulatory issues many workers were upset by his comments at the time particularly black employees who were rising through the ranks when the comments resurfaced in a reuters story in september mr scharf was widely criticized staffers said they felt uncomfortable having to defend the bank to people outside it the company initially tweeted this response from mr scharf i am sorry my comment has been misinterpreted later in a letter to employees he wrote i apologize for making an insensitive comment reflecting my own unconscious bias there are many talented diverse individuals working at wells fargo and throughout the financial services industry and i never meant to imply otherwise on a sept call arranged for a black employee group he took a moment to acknowledge some of the many wellwritten letters he had received from people around the bank in response to his comments according to people familiar with the call that further angered some employees who likened it to when black people are praised for being articulate a wells fargo spokeswoman said while some may have heard charlies comments differently his intention was to convey that he was moved by the thoughtful perspectives and insights that he had received on the call he also offered more context around his june comments if you look at the full paragraph and the full intent there was still plenty wrong with it but i certainly didnt mean it the way its being portrayed more broadly he said according to a recording reviewed by the wall street journal having said that i do understand it and i think it is important that we use it as an opportunity and ive used it as an opportunity to react to all the things weve heard the us labor department is investigating companies with federal contracts that have included specific numerical goals in their pledges to hire more diverse staff arguing that these resemble illegal quotas and could potentially discriminate against white applicants and other groups according to people familiar with the matter the department which sent letters to microsoft corp and wells fargo co last week about their stated goals to hire more black employees into management roles is now looking more broadly and may contact other companies soon those people said the department has asked for documents relating to these initiatives going back to jan and has given the companies until the end of this month to deliver a report wells fargo also pledged in june to double black leaders over the next five years and said it would tie certain bonuses to achieving that goal it too received a letter from the same agency reminding the bank that it may not discriminate on the basis of race to provide additional opportunities and that quotas are prohibited both companies said they are confident their efforts comply with us employment laws
