wells fargo is still trying to fix itself seven years after a fakeaccounts scandal engulfed the bank thousands of employees are grappling with how to best catch or prevent problems in everything it does each day employees gather in virtual and inperson workshops to map out the risks that come with big moves such as foreclosing on a home and small moves like allowing a customerservice representative to override a late fee how best to manage those risks is debated employees regularly present before a panel of superiors and their work either is waved through or sent back risk exercises are common at many companies but the stakes are higher at wells fargo the bank needs to upgrade its risk and control functions to its own liking and to satisfy regulators the office of the comptroller of the currency wells fargos primary regulator raised the possibility in january of breaking up banks that cant put adequate controls in place it didnt mention wells fargo specifically but the bank was widely seen as a focus of the remarks the banks stock is down about since the scandal erupted in september while jpmorgan chases has more than doubled wells fargo hasnt been able to shake a order from the federal reserve that handcuffed its ability to grow and the bank once a prolific buyer of other banks has been cutting staff and shrinking business lines for many inside wells fargo it feels like a makeorbreak moment chief executive officer charlie scharf spoke at a conference in may about what he perceived to be regulators growing willingness to take drastic action when banks arent meeting their expectations until our work is done were still at risk he said the risk exercises are expected to last for at least another year according to people familiar with the matter in these workshops technically called risk control self assessment employees document how a banking service works the risks the controls that mitigate those risks and any gaps that need to be filled with new controls in a bank controls do such things as alerting a teller to ask for identification before cashing a check the work sometimes has setbacks last year the control work for check and cash processing at the banks backend operations centers returned to the drawing board because there was no control in place for employee fraud according to people familiar with the matter banking today looks less like a collection of corner branches than webs of digital systems that move money around the globe many banks rely on aging technology accumulated through decades of acquisitions the challenge is to rework these complex webs while juggling heavy regulatory scrutiny and avoiding business disruptions it takes a long time to turn a big ship said jason goldberg an analyst at barclays and wells fargo is certainly one of the biggest the task is all the more challenging for wells fargo which once the scandal broke was criticized for having a culture that was insular and decentralized if you can change a culture in seven years youve done a good job said thomas hoenig former president of the kansas city fed and former vice chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp who hasnt directly supervised wells fargo if you cant have major progress after seven years youre probably not doing it right scharf said in a letter to shareholders earlier this year that the bank needs to meet regulators expectations for risk and controls with the speed and quality they expect this will remain our top priority he wrote the urgency to right the ship and the strain that effort entails is felt across the banks workforce current and former employees said a manager wrote in january to his team that works on internal controls each of us is under tremendous stress whether we acknowledge it or not and that stress builds over time some workers doing the risk exercises have had to tell their families that they might be scarcely seen for a while others had to cancel family vacations to meet deadlines scott powell wells fargos chief operating officer said the bank appreciates the hard work employees are putting into this effort the bank has support systems in place for employees in the controlevaluation process in general there is nothing unique about the timelines he said were always talking about how we can make our programs better and we regularly make enhancements he said if we thought for a second we were creating a process that wasnt achievable we would modify it years before the fakeaccounts scandal wells fargo enjoyed a reputation as a wellrun lowrisk place underneath executives pressed an aggressive sales culture branch employees sometimes opened customer accounts using fictitious or unauthorized information to meet sales goals in september federal and local authorities slapped the bank with million in fines for the fake accounts soon problems were coming to light in nearly every corner of the bank regulators concluded wells fargo couldnt manage its own risk in the fed took the unprecedented move of capping wells fargos growth scharf joined the following year the third ceo since the scandal he tossed out the banks previous overhaul efforts and drew up a new plan to rework internal controls scharf has said that when he took the job he expected the bank to be further along than it was in the four years since things have taken longer than many
