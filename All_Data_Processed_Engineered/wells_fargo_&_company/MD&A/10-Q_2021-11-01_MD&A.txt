subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property it is not unusual for these lines and loans to have draw periods interestonly payments balloon payments adjustable rates and similar features junior lien loan products are primarily amortizing payment loans with fixed interest rates and repayment periods between five to years we continuously monitor the credit performance of our residential mortgage junior lien portfolio for trends and factors that influence the frequency and severity of losses such as junior lien performance when the first lien loan is delinquent our residential mortgage lines of credit both first and junior lien generally have draw periods of or years with variable interest rate and payment options available during the draw period of interestonly or of outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest as of september lines of credit in a draw period primarily used the interest only option the lines that enter their amortization period may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than the ones in their draw or term period we have considered this increased risk in our acl estimate during the draw period the borrower has the option of converting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate to a fixed rate with terms including interestonly payments for a fixed period between three to seven years or a fully amortizing payment with a fixed period between five to years at the end of the draw period a line of credit generally converts to an amortizing payment schedule with repayment terms of up to years based on the balance at time of conversion certain lines and loans have been structured with a balloon payment which requires full repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of the term period the conversion of lines or loans to fully amortizing or balloon payoff may result in a significant payment increase which can affect some borrowers ability to repay the outstanding balance in anticipation of our residential mortgage line of credit borrowers reaching the end of their contractual commitment we have created a program to inform educate and help these borrowers transition from

growth is contributing to an increase in systemic risk a countercyclical buffer of up to could be added to the riskbased capital ratio requirements under federal banking regulations the capital conservation buffer is applicable to certain institutions including wells fargo under the advanced approach and is intended to absorb losses during times of economic or financial stress the stress capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease in a bhcs riskbased capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the frbs annual supervisory stress test and related comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends because the stress capital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time our stress capital buffer

implementing an additional capital surcharge of between on the riskbased capital ratio requirements of gsibs under the rule we must annually calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges the first method method one considers our size interconnectedness cross jurisdictional activity substitutability and complexity consistent with the methodology developed by the bcbs and the financial stability board fsb the second method method two uses similar inputs but replaces substitutability with use of shortterm wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges than under method one because the gsib capital surcharge is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time the amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future
