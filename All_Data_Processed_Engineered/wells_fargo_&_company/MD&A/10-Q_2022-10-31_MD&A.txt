form 10k interest rate risk interest rate risk is created in our role as a financial intermediary for customers based on investments such as loans and other extensions of credit and debt securities interest rate risk can have a significant impact to our earnings we are subject to interest rate risk because assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times if assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising earnings will initially increase assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts shortterm and longterm market interest rates may change by different amounts for example the shape of the yield curve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs differently the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change for example if longterm mortgage interest rates increase sharply mbs held in the debt securities portfolio may pay down at a slower rate than anticipated which could impact portfolio income or interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand collateral values credit losses mortgage origination volume and the fair value of msrs and other financial instruments we assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under various net interest income simulations using many interest rate scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes the degree of change over time the speed of change and the projected shape of the yield curve these simulations require assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet composition such as loan originations prepayment rates on loans and debt securities deposit flows and mix as well as pricing strategies our most recent simulations as presented in table estimate net interest income sensitivity over the next months using instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both lower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario steeper and flatter scenarios measure nonparallel changes in the yield curve with longterm interest rates defined as all tenors three years and longer and shortterm interest rates defined as all tenors less than three years where applicable us dollar interest rates are floored at the following describes the simulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in table simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to our assets and liabilities other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated with the changes in interest rates are held constant mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or lower interest rates our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes consistent with the base interest rate trajectory deposit mix is modeled to be the same as in the base scenario across the alternative scenarios in higher interest rate scenarios wells fargo company risk management assetliability management continued customer deposit activity that shifts balances into higher yielding products could impact expected net interest income the interest rate sensitivity of deposits is modeled using the historical behavior of our deposits portfolio and reflects the expectations of deposit products repricing as market interest rates change referred to as deposit betas as well as migration to higher cost deposit products consistent with the base scenario our actual experience may differ from expectations due to the lag or acceleration of deposit repricing changes in consumer behavior and other factors we hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities portfolios constant across scenarios table net interest income sensitivity in billions parallel shift bps shift in interest rates bps shift in interest rates steeper yield curve sep dec bps shift in longterm interest rates flatter yield curve bps shift in shortterm interest rates bps shift in longterm interest rates the changes in our interest rate sensitivity from december to september in table reflected updates to our base scenario which included changes in expectations for both balance sheet composition and interest rates our interest rate sensitivity indicates that we would expect to benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities while in the case of lower interest rates our assets would reprice downward and to a greater degree than our liabilities resulting in lower net interest income for the december simulations with downward shifts in interest rates the interest rate floor limited the amount of the decline in net interest income we may have a larger decline in net interest income when interest rates increase for the base scenario relative to the interest rate floor the sensitivity results above do not capture noninterest income or expense impacts our interest rate sensitive noninterest income and expense are predominantly driven by mortgage banking activities and may move in the opposite direction of our net interest income see the risk management assetliability management mortgage banking interest rate

management we have an active program for managing capital through a comprehensive process for assessing the companys overall capital adequacy our objective is to maintain capital at an amount

dividends and share repurchases as well as through the issuance of preferred stock and long and shortterm debt retained earnings at september increased billion from december predominantly as a result

was issued in connection with employee compensation and benefits in the first nine months of we repurchased million shares of common stock at a cost of billion in the first nine months of our aoci

differ over time our stress capital buffer and thus our riskbased capital ratio requirements under the standardized approach are subject to change in future periods our stress capital buffer for the

also subject to the frbs rule implementing an additional capital surcharge of between on the riskbased capital ratio requirements of gsibs under the rule we must annually calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges the first method method one considers our size interconnectedness crossjurisdictional activity substitutability and complexity consistent with the methodology developed by the bcbs and the financial stability board fsb the second method method two uses similar inputs but replaces substitutability with use of shortterm table capital components and ratios wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges than under method one because the gsib capital surcharge is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time the amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years if our annual calculation results in a decrease to our gsib capital surcharge the decrease takes effect the next calendar year if our annual calculation results in an increase to our gsib capital surcharge the increase takes effect in two calendar years for our gsib capital surcharge is our gsib capital surcharge will not change in

significant accounting updates applicable to us that have been issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb but are not yet effective table current accounting developments issued standards description and effective date financial statement impact asu financial services insurance topic targeted improvements to the accounting for longduration contracts and subsequent related updates the update effective january requires market risk benefits features of insurance contracts that protect the policyholder from otherthannominal capital market risk and expose the insurer to that risk to be measured at fair value through earnings with changes in fair value attributable to our own credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income the update also requires more frequent updates for insurance assumptions mandates the use of a standardized discount rate for traditional longduration contracts and simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs the most significant impact of adoption relates to reinsurance of variable annuity products for a limited number of our insurance clients our reinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts these variable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum benefits that require us to make benefit payments for the remainder of the policyholders life once the account values are exhausted these guaranteed minimum benefits meet the definition of market risk benefits and will be measured at fair value the cumulative effect of the difference between fair value and the carrying value upon adoption of the update net of income tax adjustments and excluding the impact of our own credit risk will be recognized in the opening balance of retained earnings in the earliest period presented and will affect our regulatory capital calculations at september our estimated liability related to these guaranteed minimum benefits was approximately million and was associated with approximately billion of policyholder account values we expect future earnings volatility from changes in the fair value of market risk benefits which are sensitive to changes in equity and fixed income markets as well as policyholder behavior and changes in mortality assumptions we plan to economically hedge the market volatility where feasible changes in the accounting for the liability of future policy benefits for traditional long duration contracts and deferred acquisition costs are not expected to be material asu derivatives and hedging topic fair value hedging portfolio layer method the update effective january with early adoption permitted establishes the portfolio layer method which expands an entitys ability to achieve fair value hedge accounting for interest rate risk hedges of closed portfolios of financial assets the update also provides guidance on the accounting for hedged item basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method the update improves our ability to use derivatives to hedge interest rate risk exposures associated with portfolios of financial assets such as fixedrate availableforsale debt securities and loans the update allows us to hedge a larger proportion of these portfolios by expanding the number and type of derivatives permitted as eligible hedges as well as by increasing the scope of eligible hedged items to include both prepayable and nonprepayable assets upon adoption any election to designate portfolio layer method hedges is applied prospectively additionally the update permits a onetime reclassification of debt securities from heldtomaturity to availableforsale classification as long as the securities are designated in a portfolio layer method hedge no later than days after the adoption date we are currently evaluating the impact of the update on our consolidated financial statements asu financial instrumentscredit losses topic troubled debt restructurings and vintage disclosures the update effective january with early adoption permitted eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings tdrs by creditors and introduces new required disclosures for loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty the update also amends the guidance for vintage disclosures to require disclosure of current period gross chargeoffs by year of origination the update will impact the measurement of the allowance for credit losses acl and require new disclosures related to loan modifications and credit quality specifically the update eliminates the requirement to use a discounted cash flow dcf approach to measure the acl for certain tdrs and instead allows for the use of an expected loss approach for all loans upon adoption we expect to discontinue using a dcf approach for consumer loans and retain a dcf approach for certain nonperforming commercial loans any changes to the acl as a result of the change in tdr measurement will be included as an adjustment to opening retained earnings as of the beginning of the earliest period presented requires new disclosures for modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal forgiveness interest rate reduction other than insignificant payment delay term extension or a combination of these modifications requires us to provide current period gross chargeoffs by origination date vintage in our credit

accounting models for convertible financial instruments with cash conversion and beneficial conversion features within accounting standards codification asc removing three equity classification requirements for a contract in an entitys own equity to qualify for the derivative scope exception in asc subtopic and prescribing the method used for computing earnings per share we adopted this update prospectively in first quarter this update did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements asu amends asc topic leases and provides specific guidance for lessors whose leases include variable lease payments that are not dependent on a reference index or rate and otherwise would have resulted in the recognition of a loss at lease commencement a day loss prior to asu variable lease payments were excluded from the definition of lease payments for lessors measuring their net investment loss in a salestype lease or direct financing lease this often resulted in a day

held or any economic hedges the amounts under noninvestment grade represent the notional amounts of those credit derivatives on which we have a higher risk of being required to perform under the terms of the credit derivative and are a function of the underlying assets we consider the credit risk to be low if the underlying assets under the credit derivative have an external rating that is investment grade if an external rating is not available we classify the credit derivative as noninvestment grade our maximum exposure to sold credit derivatives is managed through posted collateral
