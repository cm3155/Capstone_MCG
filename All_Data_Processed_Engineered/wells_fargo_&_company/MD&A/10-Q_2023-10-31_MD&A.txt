risks see the risk management assetliability management section in our form 10k interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that market fluctuations in interest rates credit spreads or foreign exchange can cause a loss of the companys earnings and capital stemming from mismatches in the companys asset and liability cash flows primarily arising from customerrelated activities such as lending and deposittaking we are subject to interest rate risk because assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times if assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising earnings will initially increase or when interest rates are generally falling earnings will initially decrease assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts shortterm and longterm market interest rates may change by different amounts for example the shape of the yield curve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs differently the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change for example if longterm mortgage interest rates increase sharply mortgagerelated products may pay down at a slower rate than anticipated which could impact portfolio income or interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand collateral values credit losses mortgage origination volume and the fair value of msrs and other financial instruments we assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under various net interest income simulations using many interest rate scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes the degree of change over time the speed of change and the projected shape of the yield curve these simulations require assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet composition such as loan originations prepayment rates on loans and debt securities deposit flows and mix as well as pricing strategies our most recent simulations as presented in table estimate net interest income sensitivity over the next months using instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both lower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario steeper and flatter scenarios measure nonparallel changes in the yield curve with longterm interest rates defined as all tenors three years and longer and shortterm interest rates defined as all tenors less than three years where applicable us dollar interest rates are floored at the following describes the simulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in table simulations are

scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes consistent with the base interest rate trajectory deposit mix is modeled to be the same in the base scenario and the alternative scenarios in higher

using the historical behavior of our deposits portfolio and reflects the expectations of deposit products repricing as market interest rates change referred to as deposit betas our actual experience

shift in longterm interest rates the changes in our interest rate sensitivity from december to september in table reflected updates to our base scenario including expectations for balance sheet composition and interest rates our interest rate sensitivity indicates that we would expect to benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities while in the case of lower interest rates our assets would reprice downward and to a greater degree than our liabilities resulting in lower net interest income the magnitude of the benefit if any from higher interest rates may vary from our simulations including because future deposit pricing and balances may be different from our current expectations the sensitivity results above do

countercyclical buffer in effect at september was the capital conservation buffer is applicable to certain institutions including wells fargo under the advanced approach and is intended to absorb losses during times of economic or financial stress the stress capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease in a bhcs riskbased capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the frbs annual supervisory stress test and related comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends because the stress capital buffer is calculated annually

continued as a global systemically important bank gsib we are also subject to the frbs rule implementing an additional capital surcharge between on the riskbased capital ratio requirements of gsibs under the rule we must annually calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges the first method method one considers our size interconnectedness crossjurisdictional activity substitutability and complexity consistent with the methodology developed by the bcbs and the financial stability board fsb the second method method two uses similar inputs but replaces substitutability with use of shortterm wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges than under method one because the gsib capital surcharge is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time the amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years if our annual calculation results in a decrease to our gsib capital surcharge the decrease takes effect the next calendar year if our annual calculation results in an increase to our gsib capital table capital components and ratios surcharge the increase takes effect in two calendar years our g sib capital

accounting policy election for each tax credit program for any tax credit program where the proportional amortization method is elected all investments within that program that meet eligibility criteria are required to apply the proportional amortization method the update also requires additional disclosures for any tax credit program where the proportional amortization method is elected the update eliminates the lowincome housing tax credit lihtconly scope limitation of the proportional amortization method and permits entities to account for all tax credit investments made primarily for the purpose of receiving income tax credits and income tax benefits using a consistent accounting method under the proportional amortization method tax credit investments are carried at amortized cost

programs and make a separate accounting policy election as to whether to apply the proportional amortization method for each program for any investments that will apply the proportional amortization method upon adoption of the update the cumulative effect of the difference between the current carrying value and the carrying value under the proportional amortization method will be recorded as an

interest in a real estate investment trust which has publicly traded preferred stock outstanding our accounting and reporting policies conform with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and practices in the financial services industry for discussion of our significant accounting policies see note summary of significant accounting policies in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december form 10k there were no material changes to these policies in the first nine months of to prepare the financial statements in conformity with gaap management must make estimates based on assumptions about future economic and market conditions for example unemployment market liquidity real estate prices etc that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements income and expenses during the reporting period and the related disclosures although our estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition management has made significant estimates in several areas including allowance for credit losses note loans and related allowance for credit losses valuations of residential mortgage servicing rights msrs note mortgage banking activities and note securitizations and variable interest entities valuations of financial instruments note fair values of assets and liabilities liabilities for contingent litigation losses note legal actions income taxes and goodwill impairment note intangible assets and other assets actual results could differ from those estimates these unaudited interim financial statements reflect all adjustments that are in the opinion of management necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented these adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless otherwise disclosed in this form 10q the results of operations in the interim financial statements do not necessarily indicate the results that may be expected for the full year the interim financial information should be read in conjunction with our form 10k accounting standards adopted in in we adopted the following new accounting guidance accounting standards update asu financial instruments credit losses topic troubled debt restructurings and vintage disclosures asu derivatives and hedging topic fair value hedging portfolio layer method asu business combinations topic accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers asu financial services insurance topic targeted improvements to the accounting for longduration contracts and subsequent related updates asu eliminates the accounting and reporting for troubled debt restructurings tdrs by creditors and introduces new required disclosures for loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty the new required disclosures include information about modifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal forgiveness interest rate reductions otherthaninsignificant payment delays term extensions or a combination of these modifications the asu also requires new disclosures for the financial effects of these modifications and for loan performance in the twelve months following the modification the update also amends the guidance for vintage disclosures to require disclosure of current period gross chargeoffs by year of origination see note loans and related allowance for credit losses for additional information related to the new disclosures for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty and for gross chargeoffs by year of origination which are provided on a prospective basis the update eliminates the requirement to use a discounted cash flow dcf approach to measure the allowance for credit losses acl for tdrs and instead allows for the use of a current expected credit loss approach for all loans under a current expected credit loss approach the impact of loan modifications and the subsequent performance of modified loans including defaults is reflected in the historical loss data used to calculate expected lifetime credit losses upon adoption on january we discontinued utilizing a dcf approach to measure credit impairment for consumer loans and certain commercial loans previously modified in a tdr and we removed the interest concession component recognized in the acl we elected to apply the modifiedretrospective transition approach method resulting in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption which reflects the difference between the pre modification and postmodification effective interest rates that would have been recognized over the remaining life of the loans as interest income upon adoption we recognized a decrease in our acl of million pretax and an increase to our retained earnings of million after tax we continue to use a dcf approach for certain nonaccruing noncollateral dependent commercial loans wells fargo company asu establishes the portfolio layer method which expands an entitys ability to achieve fair value hedge accounting for interest rate risk hedges of closed portfolios of financial assets the update also provides guidance on the accounting for hedged item basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method we adopted asu on january on a prospective basis no cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of stockholders equity was required upon adoption as impacts to us were reflected prospectively the portfolio layer method improves our ability to use derivatives to hedge interest rate risk exposures associated with portfolios of financial assets such as fixedrate availableforsale afs debt securities and loans the update allows us to hedge a larger proportion of these portfolios by expanding the number and type of derivatives permitted as eligible hedges as well as by increasing the scope of eligible hedged items to include both prepayable and nonprepayable assets unlike other fair value hedging relationships where basis adjustments adjust the carrying amount of the individual hedged item basis adjustments related to active portfolio layer method hedges are maintained at a portfolio level and not allocated to the individual assets in the portfolio upon adoption any election to designate portfolio layer method hedges is applied prospectively additionally the update permits a onetime reclassification of debt securities from held tomaturity htm to afs classification as long as the securities are designated in a portfolio layer method hedge no later than days after the adoption date in january we reclassified fixedrate debt securities with an aggregate fair value of billion and amortized cost of billion from htm to afs and designated interest rate swaps with notional amounts of billion as fair value hedges using the portfolio layer method the transfer of debt securities was recorded at fair value and resulted in approximately million of unrealized losses associated with afs debt securities being recorded to other comprehensive income net of deferred taxes see note availableforsale and heldtomaturity debt securities for additional information about the companys portfolio layer method hedge basis adjustments and htm to afs transfers in connection with adoption of the update and note derivatives for disclosures regarding our portfolio layer method hedging relationships asu amends accounting standards codification asc business combinations to require entities to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination in accordance with asc revenue recognition prior to asu there was diversity in practice related to recognition treatment and acquirers generally measured such items at acquisition date fair value we adopted this update prospectively on january this update did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements asu changes the accounting for longduration insurance contracts or contract features that provide benefits to the policyholder in addition to the policyholders account value these features which the asu defines as market risk benefits protect the policyholder to some degree from capital markets risk and expose the insurer or reinsurer to that risk the asu requires all market risk benefits to be measured at fair value through earnings with changes in fair value attributable to our own credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income we reinsure certain variable annuity products for a limited number of insurance clients with guaranteed minimum benefits which are accounted for as market risk benefits under the asu our reinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts we utilize a discounted cash flow model to value our market risk benefits market risk benefits are level fair value liabilities because they are valued using significant unobservable inputs the fair value of our market risk benefits is sensitive to changes in fixed income and equity markets as well as policyholder behavior eg withdrawals lapses utilization rate and changes in mortality assumptions beginning first quarter we use derivative instruments where feasible to economically hedge the interest rate and equity markets volatility the fair value of market risk benefits is measured at the contract level and is recognized in accrued expenses and other liabilities we recognize changes in fair value for our market risk benefits excluding the change in fair value related to our own credit risk in noninterest income along with the changes in fair value of economic hedges changes in fair value attributable to our own credit risk are recorded in other comprehensive income upon adoption on january as required under the asu we implemented the accounting changes for market risk benefits retrospectively to the earliest period presented which resulted in an aftertax cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income by million and million respectively as of january the asu also requires more frequent updates for insurance assumptions mandates the use of a standardized discount rate for traditional longduration contracts and simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs the accounting changes for the liability of future policyholder benefits for traditional longduration contracts included in accrued expenses and other liabilities and deferred acquisition costs included in other assets did not have a material impact upon adoption
