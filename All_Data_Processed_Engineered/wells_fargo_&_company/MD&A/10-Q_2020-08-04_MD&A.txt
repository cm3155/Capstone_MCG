wealth and investment management wim these segments are defined by product type and customer segment and their results are based on our management reporting process the management reporting process is based on us gaap with specific adjustments such as for funds transfer pricing for assetliability management for shared revenues and expenses and taxequivalent adjustments to consistently reflect income from taxable and taxexempt sources on february we announced a new organizational structure with five principal lines of business consumer and small business banking consumer lending commercial banking corporate and investment banking and wealth and investment management this new organizational structure is intended to help drive operating control and business performance in july the company completed the transition to this new organizational structure including finalizing leadership for these principal business lines and aligning management reporting and allocation methodologies these

and the following discussion present our results by operating segment for additional description of our operating segments including additional financial information and the underlying management reporting process see note operating segments to financial statements in this report we perform a goodwill impairment assessment annually in the fourth quarter however in second quarter we performed another interim quantitative impairment assessment of our goodwill given deteriorated macroeconomic conditions from the impact of the covid19 pandemic these market conditions led to a sharp decline in share prices for wells fargo and other companies across many industries as part of our interim assessment we updated our assumptions used in both the income and market approaches for estimating fair values of our reporting units the update to assumptions incorporated current marketbased information such as priceearnings information and a regular update to our internal enterprisewide table operating segment results highlights forecasts which reflected lower interest rates and higher expected credit losses as well as a weaker macroeconomic outlook since our annual assessment we have observed declines in the fair values of our reporting units and the amount of excess fair value over the carrying amount of our reporting units however we did not have evidence of goodwill impairment as of june the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount by or higher the estimated fair value of our corporate and investment banking reporting unit included within the wholesale banking operating segment increased in second quarter as it reflected recent updates in priceearnings information used in our market approach valuations the increase in fair value resulted in significant excess fair value over the carrying amount for the reporting unit compared with the prior quarter the aggregate fair value of our reporting units exceeded our market capitalization as of june our individual reporting unit fair values cannot be directly correlated to the companys market capitalization however we considered several factors in the comparison of aggregate fair value to market capitalization including i control premiums adjusted for the current market environment which include synergies that may not be reflected in current market pricing ii degree of complexity and execution risk at the reporting unit level compared with the enterprise level and iii issues or risks related to the company level that may not be included in the fair value of the individual reporting units given the uncertainty of the severity or length of the current economic downturn we will continue to monitor our performance against our internal forecasts as well as market conditions for circumstances that could have a further negative effect on the estimated fair values of our reporting units in connection with the planned change to our operating segment disclosures we will realign our goodwill to the reporting units that underlie our operating segments which could impact the results of our goodwill impairment assessment we will reassess goodwill for

a year ago reflected an increase in the allowance for credit losses for loans due to the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic we consider multiple economic scenarios to develop our estimate of the allowance for credit losses for loans the scenarios include a base case considered to be the most likely economic forecast along with an optimistic upside and a pessimistic downside economic forecast our estimate of the allowance for credit losses for loans at june was based on a weighting of the base case and downside economic scenarios of and respectively with no weighting applied to the upside scenario the base case economic forecast assumed near term economic stress recovering into late the downside scenario assumed more sustained adverse economic impacts resulting from the covid19 pandemic compared with the base case the downside scenario assumed us real gdp increasing slowly and not fully recovering during the remainder of and and a sustained elevation in the us unemployment rate until mid2022 we considered expectations for the impact of government economic stimulus programs in effect on june however we did not consider the impact of future government economic stimulus programs in addition we considered expectations for the impact of customer accommodation activity as well as the estimated impact on certain industries that we consider to be directly and most adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic in addition to quantitative estimates we consider qualitative factors that represent risks inherent in our processes and assumptions such as economic environmental factors modeling assumptions and performance and other subjective factors including industry trends and emerging risk assessments at june the qualitative portion of our allowance for credit losses for loans included adjustments for model performance relative to managements loss expectations including specific incremental risks from the oil and gas commercial real estate and home

weighted average of the forecasted economic variable inputs quarterly average seasonally adjusted annualized rate percentage change year over year of national average outlook differs by geography and property type future amounts of the allowance for credit losses for loans will be based on a variety of factors including loan balance changes portfolio credit quality and mix changes and changes in general economic conditions and expectations including for unemployment and gdp among other factors based on economic conditions at the end of second quarter it was difficult to estimate the length and severity of the economic downturn that may result from the covid19 pandemic and the impact of other factors that may influence the level of eventual losses and corresponding requirements for future amounts of the allowance for credit losses including the impact of economic stimulus programs and customer accommodation activity the covid19 pandemic could continue to result in the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses particularly if the impact on the economy worsens we believe the allowance for credit losses for loans of billion at june was appropriate to cover expected credit losses including unfunded credit commitments at that date the entire allowance is available to absorb expected credit losses from the total loan portfolio the allowance for credit losses for loans is subject to change and reflects existing factors as of the date of determination including economic or market conditions and ongoing

federal and state regulators for alleged servicing issues and practices in general these can require us to provide customers with loan modification relief refinancing relief and foreclosure prevention and assistance as well as can impose certain monetary penalties on us as a servicer we are required to advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest on the mortgage loans we service the amount and timing of reimbursement of these advances vary by investor and the applicable servicing agreements in place due to an increase in customer requests for payment deferrals as a result of the covid19 pandemic the amount of principal and interest advances we were required to make as a servicer increased in second quarter the amount of these advances may continue to increase if additional payment deferrals are provided payment deferrals also delay the collection of contractually specified servicing fees resulting in lower net servicing income in accordance with applicable servicing guidelines delinquency status continues to advance for loans with covid related payment deferrals which has resulted in an increase in delinquent loans serviced for others and a corresponding increase in loans eligible for repurchase from gnma loan securitization pools our option to repurchase loans from gnma loan securitization pools becomes exercisable when three scheduled loan payments remain unpaid by the borrower we generally repurchase these loans for cash and as a result our total consolidated assets do not change in july we repurchased billion of these delinquent loans and we expect to repurchase billion of these delinquent loans in august loans that regain current status or are otherwise modified in accordance with applicable servicing guidelines may be included in future gnma loan securitization pools however in accordance with guidance issued by gnma in june repurchased loans with covidrelated payment deferrals are ineligible for inclusion in

managing interest rate risk market risk liquidity and funding primary oversight of interest rate risk and market risk resides with the finance committee of our board which oversees the administration and effectiveness of financial risk management policies and processes used to assess and manage these risks primary oversight of liquidity and funding resides with the risk committee of the board at the management level we utilize a corporate assetliability committee corporate alco which consists of management from finance risk and business groups to oversee these risks and provide periodic reports to the boards finance committee and risk committee as appropriate as discussed in more detail for market risk activities below we employ separate management level oversight specific to market risk assetliability management continued interest rate risk interest rate risk which potentially can have a significant earnings impact is an integral part of being a financial intermediary we are subject to interest rate risk because assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times for example if assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising earnings will initially increase assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts for example when the general level of interest rates is rising we may increase rates paid on checking and savings deposit accounts by an amount that is less than the general rise in market interest rates shortterm and longterm market interest rates may change by different amounts for example the shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields and funding costs differently the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change for example if longterm mortgage interest rates increase sharply mbs held in the debt securities portfolio may pay down slower than anticipated which could impact portfolio income or interest rates may also have a direct or indirect effect on loan demand collateral values credit losses mortgage origination volume the fair value of msrs and other financial instruments the value of the pension liability and other items affecting earnings we assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under various net interest income simulations using many interest rate scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes the degree of change over time the speed of change and the projected shape of the yield curve these simulations require assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet composition such as loan originations prepayment speeds on loans and debt securities deposit flows and mix as well as pricing strategies currently our profile is such that we project net interest income will benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities while in the case of lower interest rates our assets would reprice downward and to a greater degree than our liabilities our most recent simulations estimate net interest income sensitivity over the next two years under a range of both lower and higher interest rates measured impacts from standardized ramps gradual changes and shocks instantaneous changes are summarized in table indicating net interest income sensitivity relative to the companys base net interest income plan ramp scenarios assume interest rates move gradually in parallel across the yield curve relative to the base scenario in year one and the full amount of the ramp is held as a constant differential to the base scenario in year two the following describes the simulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in table simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated growth across assets and liabilities other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated with the changes in interest rates are held constant mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or lower interest rates our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes consistent with the base interest rate trajectory deposit mix is modeled to be the same as in the base scenario across the alternative scenarios in higher interest rate scenarios customer activity that shifts balances into higheryielding products could reduce expected net interest income we hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities portfolios constant across scenarios table net interest income sensitivity over next twoyear horizon

interest rate sensitive noninterest income and expense impacts our interest rate sensitive noninterest income and expense are predominantly driven by mortgage banking activities and may move in the opposite direction of our net interest income mortgage originations generally decline in response to higher interest rates and generally increase particularly refinancing activity in response to lower interest rates mortgage results are also impacted by the valuation of msrs and related hedge positions see the risk management assetliability management mortgage banking interest rate and market risk section in this report for more information interest rate sensitive noninterest income also results from changes in earnings credit for noninterestbearing deposits that reduce treasury management deposit service fees additionally for the trading portfolio our trading assets are before the effects of certain economic hedges generally less sensitive to changes in interest rates than the related funding liabilities as a result net interest income from the trading portfolio contracts and expands as interest rates rise and fall respectively the impact to net interest income does not include the fair value changes of trading securities and loans which along with the effects of related economic hedges are recorded in noninterest income we use the debt securities portfolio and exchangetraded

exposures as discussed below riskbased capital and riskweighted assets the company is subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to implement basel iii capital requirements for us banking organizations the federal banking regulators capital rules among other things required on a fully phasedin basis as of june a minimum common equity tier cet1 ratio of comprised of a minimum requirement plus a capital conservation buffer of and for us as a global systemically important bank gsib a capital surcharge of a minimum tier capital ratio of comprised of a minimum requirement plus the capital conservation buffer of and the gsib capital surcharge of a minimum total capital ratio of comprised of a minimum requirement plus the capital conservation buffer of and the gsib capital surcharge of a potential countercyclical buffer of up to to be added to the minimum capital ratios which could be imposed by regulators at their discretion if it is determined that a period of excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic risk and a minimum tier leverage ratio of the basel iii capital requirements for calculating cet1 and tier capital along with riskweighted assets rwas are fully phasedin however the requirements for determining tier and total capital are still in accordance with transition requirements and are scheduled to be fully phasedin by the end of the basel iii capital rules contain two frameworks for calculating capital requirements a standardized approach and an advanced approach applicable to certain institutions including wells fargo accordingly in the assessment of our capital adequacy we must report the lower of our cet1 tier and total capital ratios calculated under the standardized approach and under the advanced approach the difference between rwas under the standardized and advanced approach has narrowed in recent quarters due to economic conditions from the covid19 pandemic impacting our calculation of advanced approach rwas in particular downgrades of loans in our loan portfolio which drive negative credit risk migration increased our advanced approach rwas at june we expect this trend to continue if the economic impact of the covid19 pandemic continues to affect our customer base effective october a stress capital buffer will be included in the minimum capital ratio requirements the stress capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease in a bhcs riskbased capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the frbs annual supervisory stress test and related comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends the stress capital buffer will replace the current capital conservation buffer under the standardized approach on june following the frbs release of the results of the supervisory stress test and related ccar the company announced that it expects its stress capital buffer to be which is the lowest possible under the new framework and would keep the regulatory minimum for the companys cet1 ratio at the frb has indicated that it will publish the final stress capital buffer for each bhc by august because the stress capital buffer is calculated annually as part of the frbs supervisory stress test and related ccar and will be based on data that can differ over time our stress capital buffer and thus the regulatory minimums for our capital ratios are subject to change in future years as a gsib we are also subject to the frbs rule implementing the additional capital surcharge of between on the minimum capital requirements of gsibs under the rule we must annually calculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges the first method method one considers our size interconnectedness crossjurisdictional activity substitutability and complexity consistent with the methodology developed by the bcbs and the financial stability board fsb the second method method two uses similar inputs but replaces substitutability with use of shortterm wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges than the bcbs methodology because the gsib capital surcharge is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time the amount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years in second quarter the company elected to apply a modified transition

management liquidity and funding liquidity standards section in this report federal banking regulators have issued a final rule regarding the us implementation of the basel iii lcr and a proposed rule regarding the nsfr capital planning and stress testing our planned longterm capital structure is designed to meet regulatory and market expectations we believe that our long term targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow our business satisfy our customers financial needs in varying environments access markets and maintain flexibility to return capital to our shareholders our longterm targeted capital structure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital requirements including the gsib capital surcharge accordingly based on the final basel iii capital rules under the lower of the standardized or advanced approaches cet1 capital ratios we currently target a longterm cet1 capital ratio at or in excess of which includes a gsib capital surcharge our capital targets are subject to change based on various factors including changes to the regulatory capital framework and expectations for large banks promulgated by bank regulatory agencies changes to the regulatory minimums for our capital ratios including changes to our stress capital buffer planned capital actions changes in our risk profile and other factors under the frbs capital plan rule large bhcs are required to submit capital plans annually for review to determine if the frb has any objections before making any capital distributions the rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material changes in a bhcs risk profile including as a result of any significant acquisitions the frb assesses among other things the overall financial condition risk profile and capital adequacy of bhcs when evaluating capital plans our capital plan which was submitted on april as part of ccar included a comprehensive capital outlook supported by an assessment of expected sources and uses of capital over a given planning horizon under a range of expected and stress scenarios as part of the ccar the frb also generated a supervisory stress test which assumed a sharp decline in the economy and significant decline in asset pricing using the information provided by the company to estimate certain limited exceptions to this prohibition which are described in the capital planning and stress testing section above at june we had remaining board authority to repurchase approximately million shares subject to regulatory and legal conditions for more information about share repurchases during second quarter see part ii item in this report historically our policy has been to repurchase shares under the safe harbor conditions of rule of the securities exchange act of including a limitation on the daily volume of repurchases rule imposes an additional daily volume limitation on share repurchases during a pending merger or acquisition in which shares of our stock will constitute some or all of the consideration our management may determine that during a pending stock merger or acquisition when the safe harbor would otherwise be available it is in our best interest to repurchase shares in excess of this additional daily volume limitation in such cases we intend to repurchase shares in compliance with the other conditions of the safe harbor including the standing daily volume limitation that applies whether or not there is a pending stock merger or acquisition for additional information about share repurchases see note summary of significant accounting policies to financial statements in this report capital management continued performance the frb reviewed the supervisory stress test results both as required under the doddfrank act using a common set of capital actions for all large bhcs and by taking into account the companys proposed capital actions the frb published its supervisory stress test results as required under the doddfrank act on june on june the frb also announced that it is requiring large bhcs including wells fargo to update and resubmit their capital plans within days after the frb provides updated scenarios requiring resubmission will prohibit each bhc from making any capital distribution excluding any capital distribution arising from the issuance of a capital instrument eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio unless otherwise approved by the frb through the end of third quarter the frb is authorizing each bhc to i make share repurchases relating to issuances of common stock related to employee stock ownership plans ii provided that the bhc does not increase the amount of its common stock dividends pay common stock dividends that do not exceed an amount equal to the average of the bhcs net income for the four preceding calendar quarters unless otherwise specified by the frb and iii make scheduled payments on additional tier and tier capital instruments these provisions may be extended by the frb quarterbyquarter concurrently with ccar federal banking regulators also require large bhcs and banks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the institution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during periods of adverse economic and financial conditions these stress testing requirements set forth the timing and type of stress test activities large bhcs and banks must undertake as well as rules governing stress testing controls oversight and disclosure requirements we submitted the results of our stress test to the frb and disclosed a summary of the results in june securities repurchases from time to time the board authorizes the company to repurchase shares of our common stock although we announce when the board authorizes share repurchases we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares future stock repurchases may be private or openmarket repurchases including block transactions accelerated or delayed block transactions forward repurchase transactions and similar transactions additionally we may enter into plans to purchase stock that satisfy the conditions of rule 10b51 of the securities exchange act of various factors determine the amount of our share repurchases including our capital requirements the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions market conditions including the trading price of our stock and regulatory and legal considerations including the frbs response to our capital plan and to changes in our risk profile due to the various factors impacting the amount of our share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be in the market regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations under our capital plan our share repurchases occur at various price levels we may suspend share repurchase activity at any time on march we along with the other members of the financial services forum suspended our share repurchase activities for the remainder of the first quarter and for second quarter on june the frb announced that it was prohibiting large bhcs including wells fargo from making any capital distribution excluding any capital distribution arising from the issuance of a capital instrument eligible for inclusion in the numerator of a regulatory capital ratio unless otherwise approved by the frb through the end of third quarter the frb authorized regulatory matters since the enactment of the doddfrank act in the us financial services industry has been subject to a significant increase in regulation and regulatory oversight initiatives this increased regulation and oversight has substantially changed how most us financial services companies conduct business and has increased their regulatory compliance costs for a discussion of certain consent orders applicable to the company see the overview section in this report the following supplements our discussion of the other significant regulations and regulatory oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect our business contained in the regulatory matters and risk factors sections in our form 10k and in our first quarter report on form 10q in addition the occ and the frb have issued guidelines for banks and bhcs related to working with customers affected by the covid19 pandemic including guidance with respect to waiving fees offering repayment accommodations providing payment deferrals and increasing daily withdrawal limits at automated teller machines in addition the federal government has instituted a moratorium on certain mortgage foreclosure activities any current or future rules regulations and guidance related to the covid19 pandemic and its impacts could require us to change certain of our business practices reduce our revenue and earnings impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our business operations andor competitive position regulatory developments related to covid19 in response to the covid19 pandemic and related events federal banking regulators have undertaken a number of measures to help stabilize the banking sector support the broader economy and facilitate the ability of banking organizations like wells fargo to continue lending to consumers and businesses for example in order to facilitate the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act federal banking regulators issued interim final rules designed to encourage financial institutions to participate in stimulus measures such as the small business administrations paycheck protection program and the frbs main street lending program similarly the frb launched a number of lending facilities designed to enhance liquidity and the functioning of markets including facilities covering money market mutual funds and term assetbacked securities loans federal banking regulators have also issued several joint interim final rules amending the regulatory capital and tlac rules and other prudential regulations to ease certain restrictions on banking organizations and encourage the use of certain frb established facilities in order to further promote lending to consumers and businesses critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies see note summary of significant accounting policies to financial statements in our form 10k are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition because they require that we use estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets or liabilities and financial results five of these policies are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions these policies govern the allowance for credit losses the valuation of residential msrs the fair value of financial instruments income taxes and liability for contingent litigation losses management and the boards audit committee have reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies these policies are described further in the financial review critical accounting policies section and note summary of significant accounting policies to financial statements in our form 10k in connection with our adoption of cecl on january we have updated our critical accounting policy for the allowance for credit losses allowance for credit losses we maintain an allowance for credit losses acl for loans which is managements estimate of the expected credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments at the balance sheet date excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for sale additionally we maintain an allowance for credit losses for debt securities classified as either heldtomaturity htm or availableforsale afs other financial assets measured at amortized cost net investments in leases and other offbalance sheet credit exposures in connection with our adoption of cecl we updated our approach for estimating expected credit losses which includes new areas for management judgment described more fully below and updated our accounting policies for more information see note summary of significant accounting policies to financial statements in this report for loans and htm debt securities the acl is measured based on the remaining contractual term of the financial asset including offbalance sheet credit exposures adjusted as appropriate for prepayments and permitted extension options using historical experience current conditions and forecasted information for afs debt securities the acl is measured using a discounted cash flow approach and is limited to the difference between the fair value of the security and its amortized cost changes in the acl and therefore in the related provision for credit losses can materially affect net income in applying the judgment and review required to determine the acl management considerations include the evaluation of past events historical experience changes in economic forecasts and conditions customer behavior collateral values and the length of the initial loss forecast period and other influences from time to time changes in economic factors or assumptions business strategy products or product mix or debt security investment strategy may result in a corresponding increase or decrease in our acl while our methodology attributes portions of the acl to specific financial asset classes loan and debt security portfolios or loan portfolio segments commercial and consumer the entire acl is available to absorb credit losses of the company judgment is specifically applied in economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast period forecasted economic variables such as gross domestic product gdp unemployment rate or collateral asset prices are used to estimate expected credit losses while many of these economic variables are evaluated at the macroeconomy level some economic variables may be forecasted at more granular levels for example using the metro statistical area msa level for unemployment rates home prices and commercial real estate prices quarterly we assess the length of the initial loss forecast period and have currently set the period to one year management exercises judgment when assigning weight to the three economic scenarios that are used to estimate future credit losses the three scenarios include a most likely expectation of economic variables referred to as the base case scenario as well as an optimistic upside scenario and a pessimistic downside scenario reversion of losses beyond the initial forecast period we use a reversion approach to connect the losses estimated for our initial loss forecast period to the period of our historical loss forecast based on economic conditions at the measurement date our reversion methodology considers the type of portfolio point in the credit cycle expected length of recessions and recoveries as well as other relevant factors the length of reversion period varies by asset type one year for shorter contractual term loans such as commercial loans and two years for longer contractual term loans such as real estate family mortgage loans we assess the reversion approach on a quarterly basis and the length of the reversion period by asset type annually historical loss expectations at the end of the reversion period we incorporate the changes in economic variables observed during representative historical time periods that include both recessions and expansions this analysis is used to compute average losses for any given portfolio and its associated credit characteristics annually we assess the historical time periods and ensure the average loss estimates are representative of our historical loss experience credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans unfunded credit commitments and debt securities individually assessed credit risk ratings are considered key credit variables in our modeled approaches to help assess probability of default and loss given default borrower quality ratings are aligned to the borrowers financial strength and contribute to forecasted probability of default curves collateral quality ratings combined with forecasted collateral prices as applicable contribute to the forecasted severity of loss in the event of default these credit risk ratings are reviewed by experienced senior credit officers and subjected to reviews by an internal team of credit risk specialists usage of credit loss estimation models we use internally developed models that incorporate credit attributes and economic variables to generate estimates of credit losses management uses a combination of judgement and quantitative analytics in the determination of segmentation modeling approach and variables that are leveraged in the models these models are validated in accordance with the companys policies by an internal model validation group we routinely assess our model performance and apply in our sensitivity analysis we applied weight to both the base case scenario and the downside scenario to reflect the potential for further economic deterioration from a covid19 resurgence the outcomes of both scenarios were influenced by the duration severity and timing of changes in economic variables within those scenarios the result of the sensitivity analysis would have increased the acl for loans by approximately billion at june this hypothetical increase in our acl for loans represents changes to our quantitative estimate and does not incorporate the impact of management judgment for qualitative factors applied in the current acl for loans which may have a positive or negative effect on the results also if this hypothetical result were to actually materialize the increase in our acl for loans may be recognized over time if actual loss expectations exceed our historical loss experience this sensitivity analysis does not represent managements view of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date the sensitivity analysis excludes the acl for debt securities given its size relative to the overall acl management believes that the estimate for the acl for loans was appropriate at the balance sheet date because significant judgment is used it is possible that others performing similar analyses could reach different conclusions adjustments when necessary to improve the accuracy of loss estimation we also assess our models for limitations against the companywide risk inventory to help ensure that we appropriately capture known and emerging risks in our estimate of expected credit losses and apply overlays as needed valuation of collateral the current fair value of collateral is utilized to assess the expected credit losses when a financial asset is considered to be collateral dependent we apply judgment when valuing the collateral either through appraisals evaluation of the cash flows of the property or other quantitative techniques decreases in collateral valuations support incremental chargedowns and increases in collateral valuation are included in the allowance for credit losses as a negative allowance when the financial asset has been previously writtendown below current recovery value contractual term considerations the remaining contractual term of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and certain expected extensions renewals or modifications we extend the contractual term when we are not able to unconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension options we also incorporate into our allowance for credit losses any scenarios where we reasonably expect to provide an extension through a tdr qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in the loss models these amounts represent managements judgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the acl we also consider economic environmental factors modeling assumptions and performance process risk and other subjective factors including industry trends and emerging risk assessments sensitivity the acl for loans is sensitive to changes in key assumptions which requires significant judgment to be used by management future amounts of the acl for loans will be based on a variety of factors including loan balance changes portfolio credit quality and general economic conditions general economic conditions are forecasted using economic variables which could have varying impacts on different financial assets or portfolios additionally throughout numerous credit cycles there are observed changes in economic variables such as the unemployment rate gdp and real estate prices which may not move in a correlated manner as variables may move in opposite directions or differ across portfolios or geography current accounting developments table provides the significant accounting updates applicable to us that have been issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb but are not yet effective table current accounting developments issued standards description effective date and financial statement impact asu financial services insurance topic targeted improvements to the accounting for longduration contracts and subsequent related updates the update requires all features in longduration insurance contracts that meet the definition of a market risk benefit to be measured at fair value through earnings with changes in fair value attributable to our own credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income currently two measurement models exist for these features fair value and insurance accrual the update requires the use of a standardized discount rate and routine updates for insurance assumptions used in valuing the liability for future policy benefits for traditional longduration contracts the update also simplifies the amortization of deferred acquisition costs the guidance becomes effective on january certain of our variable annuity reinsurance products meet the definition of market risk benefits and will require the associated insurance related reserves for these products to be measured at fair value as of the earliest period presented with the cumulative effect on fair value for changes attributable to our own credit risk recognized in the beginning balance of accumulated other comprehensive income the cumulative effect of the difference between fair value and carrying value excluding the effect of our own credit will be recognized in the opening balance of retained earnings as of june we held billion in insurancerelated reserves of which million was in scope of the update a total of million was associated with products that meet the definition of market risk benefits and of this amount million was measured at fair value under current accounting standards the market risk benefits are largely indexed to us equity and fixed income markets upon adoption we may incur periodic earnings volatility from changes in the fair value of market risk benefits generally due to the long duration of these contracts we plan to economically hedge this volatility where feasible the ultimate impact of these changes will depend on the composition of our market risk benefits portfolio at the date of adoption changes in the accounting for the liability of future policy benefits for traditional longduration contracts and deferred acquisition costs will be applied to all outstanding longduration contracts on the basis of their existing carrying amounts at the beginning of the earliest period presented and are not expected to be material the following updates are applicable to us but are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements asu investments equity securities topic investments equity method and joint ventures topic and derivatives and hedging topic clarifying

of significant accounting policies in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december form 10k to prepare the financial statements in conformity with gaap management must make estimates based on assumptions about future economic and market conditions for example unemployment market liquidity real estate prices etc that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements income and expenses during the reporting period and the related disclosures although our estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition management has made significant estimates in several areas including allowance for credit losses note loans and related allowance for credit losses valuations of residential mortgage servicing rights msrs note securitizations and variable interest entities and note mortgage banking activities valuations of financial instruments note derivatives and note fair values of assets and liabilities liabilities for contingent litigation losses note legal actions and income taxes actual results could differ from those estimates these unaudited interim financial statements reflect all adjustments that are in the opinion of management necessary for a fair statement of the results for the periods presented these adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless otherwise disclosed in this form 10q the results of operations in the interim financial statements do not necessarily indicate the results that may be expected for the full year the interim financial information should be read in conjunction with our form 10k accounting standards adopted in in we adopted the following new accounting guidance accounting standards update asu or update reference rate reform topic facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting asu codification improvements to topic financial instruments credit losses topic derivatives and hedging and topic financial instruments this update includes guidance on recoveries of financial assets which is included in the discussion for asu below asu consolidation topic targeted improvements to related party guidance for variable interest entities asu intangibles goodwill and other internal use software subtopic customers accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract a consensus of the financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force asu fair value measurement topic disclosure framework changes to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurement asu intangibles goodwill and other topic simplifying the test for goodwill impairment asu financial instruments credit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments and related subsequent updates asu provides optional temporary relief to ease the burden of accounting for reference rate reform activities that affect contractual modifications of floating rate financial instruments indexed to interbank offering rates ibors and hedge accounting relationships modifications of qualifying contracts are accounted for as the continuation of an existing contract rather than as a new contract modifications of qualifying hedging relationships will not require discontinuation of the existing hedge accounting relationships the application of the relief for qualifying existing hedging relationships may be made on a hedgebyhedge basis and across multiple reporting periods we adopted asu on april and the guidance will be followed until the update terminates on december this guidance is applied on a prospective basis the update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in second quarter asu updates the guidance used by decisionmakers of vies indirect interests held through related parties in common control arrangements will be considered on a proportional basis for determining whether fees paid to decisionmakers and service providers are variable interests this is consistent with how indirect interests held through related parties under common control are considered for determining whether a reporting entity must consolidate a vie the update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements asu clarifies the accounting for implementation costs related to a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract and enhances disclosures around implementation costs for internaluse software and cloud computing arrangements the guidance aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internaluse note summary of significant accounting policies continued software and hosting arrangements that include an internaluse software license it also requires the expense related to the capitalized implementation costs be presented in the same line item in the statement of income as the fees associated with the hosting element of the arrangement and capitalized implementation costs be presented in the balance sheet in the same line item that a prepayment for the fees of the associated hosting arrangement are presented the update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements asu clarifies eliminates and adds certain fair value measurement disclosure requirements for assets and liabilities which affects our disclosures in note fair values of assets and liabilities although the asu became effective on january it permitted early adoption of individual requirements without causing others to be early adopted and as such we partially adopted the update during third quarter and the remainder of the requirements in first quarter the update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements asu simplifies the goodwill impairment test by eliminating the requirement to assign the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination the update requires that a goodwill impairment loss is recognized if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount including goodwill the goodwill impairment loss is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit the guidance did not change the qualitative assessment of goodwill this guidance is applied on a prospective basis and accordingly the update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements asu changes the accounting for the measurement of credit losses on loans and debt securities for loans and heldto maturity htm debt securities the update requires a current expected credit loss cecl measurement to estimate the allowance for credit losses acl for the remaining contractual term adjusted for prepayments of the financial asset including offbalance sheet credit exposures using historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts also the update eliminates the existing guidance for purchased creditimpaired pci loans but requires an allowance for purchased financial assets with more than an insignificant deterioration of credit since origination in addition the update modifies the otherthantemporary impairment otti model for availableforsale afs debt securities to require an allowance for credit impairment instead of a direct writedown which allows for reversal of credit impairments in future periods based on improvements in credit upon adoption we recognized an overall decrease in our acl of approximately billion pretax as a cumulative effect adjustment from a change in accounting policies which increased our retained earnings and regulatory capital amounts and ratios loans previously classified as pci were automatically transitioned to purchased creditdeteriorated pcd classification we recognized an acl for these new pcd loans and made a corresponding adjustment to the loan balance with no impact to net income or transition adjustment to retained earnings for more information on the impact of cecl by type of financial asset see table below table asu adoption impact to allowance for credit losses in billions total commercial real estate family mortgage credit card automobile other revolving credit and installment total consumer total loans availableforsale and heldtomaturity debt securities and other assets total balance outstanding acl balance coverage dec asu adoption impact jan acl balance coverage nm nm nm nm nm not meaningful amounts presented in this table may not equal the sum of its components due to rounding decrease reflecting shorter contractual maturities given limitation to contractual terms impact reflects an increase due to longer contractual terms offset by expectation of recoveries in collateral value on mortgage loans previously written down significantly below current recovery value increase due to longer contractual terms or indeterminate maturities excludes other financial assets in the scope of cecl that do not have an allowance for credit losses based on the nature of the asset the adoption of asu did not result in a change to accounting policies except as noted herein our accounting policy for the acl was updated and is now inclusive of loans debt securities and other financing receivables other than the acl and the elimination of pci loans there were no changes to accounting policies for loans as described in the form 10k for debt securities other than the policies with respect to the acl all of the current accounting policies including those that changed as a result of cecl adoption are included below under debt securities debt securities our investments in debt securities that are not held for trading purposes are classified as either debt securities availableforsale afs or heldtomaturity htm investments in debt securities for which the company does not have the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as afs afs debt securities are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in cumulative other comprehensive income oci net of the allowance for credit losses and applicable income taxes investments in debt securities for which the company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as htm htm debt securities are measured at amortized cost net of allowance for credit losses interest income and gainloss recognition unamortized premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income over the contractual life of the security using the effective interest method except for purchased callable debt securities carried at a premium for purchased callable debt securities carried at a premium the premium is amortized into interest income to the earliest call date using the effective interest method as principal repayments are received on securities eg mortgagebacked securities mbs a proportionate amount of the related premium or discount is recognized in income so that the effective interest rate on the remaining portion of the security continues unchanged we recognize realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities in net gains losses on debt securities within noninterest income using the specific identification method impairment and credit losses unrealized losses of afs debt securities are driven by a number of factors including changes in interest rates and credit spreads which impact most types of debt securities with additional considerations for certain types of debt securities debt securities of us treasury and federal agencies including federal agency mbs are not impacted by credit movements given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the us government debt securities of us states and political subdivisions are most impacted by changes in the relationship between municipal and term funding credit curves rather than by changes in the credit quality of the underlying securities structured securities such as mbs and collateralized loan obligations clo are also impacted by changes in projected collateral losses of assets underlying the security for debt securities where fair value is less than amortized cost basis we recognize impairment in earnings if we have the intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis impairment is recognized equal to the entire difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the security and is classified as net gains losses from debt securities within noninterest income following the recognition of impairment the securitys new amortized cost basis is the previous basis less impairment for debt securities where fair value is less than amortized cost basis where we did not recognize impairment in earnings we set up an allowance for credit losses as of the balance sheet date see allowance for credit losses section in this note transfers between categories of debt securities afs debt securities transferred to the htm classification are recorded at fair value and the unrealized gains or losses resulting from the transfer of these securities continue to be reported in cumulative oci the cumulative oci balance is amortized into earnings over the same period as the unamortized premiums and discounts using the effective interest method any allowance for credit losses previously recorded under the afs model on securities transferred to htm is reversed and an allowance for credit losses is subsequently recorded under the htm debt security model nonaccrual and past due and chargeoff policies we generally place debt securities on nonaccrual status using factors similar to those described for loans when we place a debt security on nonaccrual status we reverse the accrued unpaid interest receivable against interest income and suspend the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts if the ultimate collectability of the principal is in doubt on a nonaccrual debt security any cash collected is first applied to reduce the securitys amortized cost basis to zero followed by recovery of amounts previously charged off and subsequently to interest income generally we return a debt security to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal become current under the contractual terms of the security and collectability of remaining principal and interest is no longer doubtful our debt securities are considered past due when contractually required principal or interest payments have not been made on the due dates our chargeoff policy for debt securities are similar to those described for loans subsequent to chargeoff the debt security will be designated as nonaccrual and follow the process described above for any cash received allowance for credit losses the acl is managements estimate of the current expected credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments at the balance sheet date excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for sale additionally we maintain an acl on afs and htm debt securities other financing receivables measured at amortized cost and other offbalance sheet credit exposures while we attribute portions of the allowance to specific financial asset classes loan and debt security portfolios loan portfolio segments commercial and consumer or major security type the entire acl is available to absorb credit losses of the company our acl process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique risk characteristics of our financial asset classes portfolio segments and major security types for each loan portfolio segment and each major htm debt security type losses are estimated collectively for groups of loans or securities with similar risk characteristics for loans and securities that do not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets the losses are estimated individually which primarily includes our impaired large commercial loans and nonaccruing htm debt securities for afs debt securities losses are estimated at the taxlot level our acl amounts are influenced by a variety of factors including changes in loan and debt security volumes portfolio credit quality and general economic conditions general economic conditions are forecasted using economic variables which will create volatility as those variables change over time see table for key economic variables used for our loan portfolios note summary of significant accounting policies continued table key economic variables loan portfolio key economic variables total commercial real estate family mortgage gross domestic product commercial real estate asset prices where applicable unemployment rate corporate investmentgrade bond spreads home price index unemployment rate other consumer including credit card automobile and other revolving credit and installment unemployment rate our approach for estimating expected lifetime credit losses for loans and debt securities includes the following key components an initial loss forecast period of one year for all portfolio segments and classes of financing receivables and off balancesheet credit exposures this period reflects managements expectation of losses based on forward looking economic scenarios over that time a historical loss forecast period covering the remaining contractual term adjusted for expected prepayments and certain expected extensions renewals or modifications by portfolio segment and class of financing receivables based on the changes in key historical economic variables during representative historical expansionary and recessionary periods a reversion period of up to two years to connect the losses estimated for our initial loss forecast period to the period of our historical loss forecast based on economic conditions at the measurement date our reversion methodology considers the type of portfolio point in the credit cycle expected length of recessions and recoveries as well as other relevant factors utilization of discounted cash flow dcf methods to measure credit impairment for loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring unless they are collateral dependent and measured at the fair value of the collateral the dcf methods obtain estimated lifetime credit losses using the initial and historical mean loss forecast periods described above for afs debt securities and certain beneficial interests classified as htm we utilize the dcf methods to measure the acl which incorporate expected credit losses using the conceptual components described above the acl on afs debt securities is subject to a limitation based on the fair value of the debt securities fair value floor the acl for financial assets held at amortized cost and afs debt securities will be reversible with immediate recognition of recovery in earnings if credit improves the acl for financial assets held at amortized cost is a valuation account that is deducted from or added to the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected which can include a negative allowance limited to the cumulative amounts previously charged off for financial assets with an acl estimated using dcf methods changes in the acl due to the passage of time are recorded in interest income the acl for afs debt securities reflects the amount of unrealized loss related to expected credit losses limited by the amount that fair value is less than the amortized cost basis and cannot have an associated negative allowance for certain financial assets such as residential real estate loans guaranteed by the government national mortgage association gnma an agency of the federal government u s treasury and agency mortgage backed debt securities as well as certain sovereign debt securities the company has not recognized an acl as our expectation of nonpayment of the amortized cost basis based on historical losses adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts is zero a financial asset is collateraldependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the sale or operation of the collateral when a collateraldependent financial asset is probable of foreclosure we will measure the acl based on the fair value of the collateral if we intend to sell the underlying collateral we will measure the acl based on the collaterals net realizable value fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell in most situations based on our chargeoff policies we will immediately writedown the financial asset to the fair value of the collateral or net realizable value for consumer loans collateraldependent financial assets may have collateral in the form of residential real estate automobiles or other personal assets for commercial loans collateraldependent financial assets may have collateral in the form of commercial real estate or other business assets we do not generally record an acl for accrued interest receivables because uncollectible accrued interest is reversed through interest income in a timely manner in line with our non accrual and past due policies for loans and debt securities for consumer credit card and certain consumer lines of credit we include an acl for accrued interest and fees since these loans are not placed on nonaccrual status and written off until the loan is days past due accrued interest receivables are included in other assets except for certain revolving loans such as credit card loans commercial loan portfolio segment acl methodology generally commercial loans which include net investments in lease financing are assessed for estimated losses by grading each loan using various risk factors as identified through periodic reviews our estimation approach for the commercial portfolio reflects the estimated probability of default in accordance with the borrowers financial strength and the severity of loss in the event of default considering the quality of any underlying collateral probability of default and severity at the time of default are statistically derived through historical observations of default and losses after default within each credit risk rating these estimates are adjusted as appropriate based on additional analysis of longterm average loss experience compared with previously forecasted losses external loss data or other risks identified from current economic conditions and credit quality trends the estimated probability of default and severity at the time of default are applied to loan equivalent exposures to estimate losses for unfunded credit commitments consumer loan portfolio segment acl methodology for consumer loans we determine the allowance at the individual loan level when developing historical loss experience we pool loans generally by product types with similar risk characteristics such as residential real estate mortgages and credit cards as appropriate and to achieve greater accuracy we may further stratify selected portfolios by subproduct origination channel vintage loss type geographic location and other predictive characteristics we use pooled loan data such as historic delinquency and default and loss severity in the development of our consumer loan models in addition to home price trends unemployment trends and other economic variables that may influence the frequency and severity of losses in the consumer portfolio afs portfolio acl methodology we develop our acl estimate for afs debt securities by utilizing a securitylevel multiscenario probabilityweighted discounted cash flow model based on a combination of past events current conditions as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts the projected cash flows are discounted at the securitys effective interest rate except for certain variable rate securities which are discounted using projections of future changes in interest rates prepayable securities which are adjusted for estimated prepayments and securities part of a fair value hedge which use hedgeadjusted assumptions the acl on an afs debt security is limited to the difference between its amortized cost basis and fair value fair value floor and reversals of the allowance are permitted up to the amount previously recorded htm portfolio acl methodology for most htm debt securities the acl is measured using an expected loss model similar to the methodology used for loans unlike afs debt securities the acl on an htm debt security is not limited to the fair value floor certain beneficial interests categorized as htm debt securities utilize a similar discounted cash flow model as described for afs debt securities without the limitation of the fair value floor other qualitative factors the acl includes amounts for qualitative factors which may not be adequately reflected in our loss models these amounts represent managements judgment of risks in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the acl generally these amounts are established at a granular level below our loan portfolio segments we also consider economic environmental factors modeling assumptions and performance process risk and other subjective factors including industry trends and emerging risk assessments offbalance sheet credit exposures our offbalance sheet credit exposures include unfunded loan commitments generally in the form of revolving lines of credit financial guarantees not accounted for as insurance contracts or derivatives including standby letters of credit and other similar instruments for off balance sheet credit exposures we recognize an acl associated with the unfunded amounts we do not recognize an acl for commitments that are unconditionally cancelable at our discretion additionally we recognize an acl for financial guarantees that create offbalance sheet credit exposure such as loans sold with credit recourse and factoring guarantees acl for offbalance sheet credit exposures are reported as a liability in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet other financial assets other financial assets are evaluated for expected credit losses these other financial assets include accounts receivable for fees receivables from government sponsored entities such as federal national mortgage association fnma and federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc and gnma and other accounts receivable from highcredit quality counterparties such as central clearing counterparties many of these financial assets are generally not expected to have an acl as there is a zero loss expectation for example government guarantee or no historical credit losses some financial assets such as loans to employees maintain an acl that is presented on a net basis with the related amortized cost amounts in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet given the nature of these financial assets provision for credit losses is not recognized separately from the regular income or expense associated with these financial assets securities purchased under resale agreements are generally overcollateralized by securities or cash and are generally short term in nature we have elected the practical expedient for these financial assets given collateral maintenance provisions these provisions require that we monitor the collateral value and customers are required to replenish collateral if needed accordingly we generally do not maintain an acl for these financial assets purchased credit deteriorated financial assets financial assets acquired that are of poor credit quality and with more than an insignificant evidence of credit deterioration since their origination or issuance are pcd assets pcd assets are recorded at their purchase price plus an acl estimated at the time of acquisition under this approach there is no provision for credit losses recognized at acquisition rather there is a grossup of the purchase price of the financial asset for the estimate of expected credit losses and a corresponding acl recorded changes in estimates of expected credit losses after acquisition are recognized as provision for credit losses or reversal of provision for credit losses in subsequent periods in general interest income recognition for pcd financial assets is consistent with interest income recognition for the similar nonpcd financial asset troubled debt restructuring and other relief related to

bonds as commercial loans generally include contractual restrictions on prepayment servicing costs are not a driver of our msr value as we are typically primary or master servicer the higher costs of servicing delinquent and foreclosed loans is generally borne by the special servicer the primary economic driver impacting the fair value of our commercial msrs is forward interest rates which are derived from market observable yield curves used to price capital markets instruments market interest rates significantly affect interest earned on custodial deposit balances the sensitivity of the current fair value of our commercial msrs to a hypothetical immediate adverse change in the assumption about interest earned on deposit balances at june and december would result in a decrease in fair value of million and million respectively see note mortgage banking activities for further information on our commercial msrs the sensitivities in the preceding paragraph and table are hypothetical and caution should be exercised when relying on this data changes in value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in value may not be linear also the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the value of the other interests held is calculated independently table offbalance sheet loans sold or securitized without changing any other assumptions in reality changes in one factor may result in changes in others for example changes in prepayment speed estimates could result in changes in

in june the case is pending trial wholesale banking consent order investigation on november the company entered into a consent order with the occ pursuant to which the wholesale banking group was required to implement customer due diligence standards that include collection of current beneficial ownership information for certain business customers the company is responding to note legal actions continued inquiries from various federal government agencies regarding potentially inappropriate conduct in connection with the collection of beneficial ownership information outlook as described above the company establishes accruals for legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated the high end of the range of reasonably possible potential losses in excess of the companys accrual for probable and estimable losses was approximately billion as of june the outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties and it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible it is also inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable accordingly actual losses may be in excess of the established accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss wells fargo is unable to determine whether the ultimate resolution of the retail sales practices matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition based on information currently available advice of counsel available insurance coverage and established reserves wells fargo believes that the eventual outcome of other actions against wells fargo andor its subsidiaries will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on wells fargos consolidated financial condition however it is possible that the ultimate resolution of a matter if unfavorable may be material to wells fargos results of operations for any particular period note derivatives we use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk including interest rate risk credit

companies classified in other assets on the balance sheet we typically use a market approach to estimate the fair value of our nonmarketable private equity and venture capital investments in portfolio companies the market approach bases the fair value measurement on market data for example use of market comparable pricing techniques that are used to derive the enterprise value of the portfolio company market comparable pricing techniques include utilization of financial metrics of comparable public companies multiples such as ratios of enterprise value or market value of equity to revenue ebitda net income or book value comparable company valuation multiples are evaluated and adjusted as necessary to reflect the comparative operational financial or marketability differences between the public company and subject portfolio company in estimating its fair value market comparable pricing techniques also use recent or anticipated transactions for example a financing round merger acquisition or bankruptcy involving the subject portfolio company or participants in its industry or related industries based upon these recent or anticipated transactions current market conditions and other factors specific to the issuer we make adjustments to estimate the enterprise value of the portfolio company as a result of the recent market environment we also utilized other valuation techniques these techniques included the use of company risk factors in the estimation of the fair value of certain nonmarketable equity securities the company risk factors are based upon entityspecific considerations including the debt and liquidity profile projected cash flow or funding issues as well as other factors that may affect the companys outlook fair value option the fair
