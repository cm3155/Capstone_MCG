w scharf president chief executive officer director wells fargo co thank you john and good morning everyone its good to be with you on my first earnings call as i go through my remarks id ask that you remember that i just joined wells fargo less than three months ago its been a busy time as ive been working to get to know the company our opportunities and challenges and ive learned a lot but as i discuss my observations please recognize that it is still early days i dont have all the answers yet but i will share more as i learn more and as the year progresses johns going to cover the quarter in detail in a few minutes and well answer your questions but you can see that a series of legacy issues meaningfully impacted our results in the quarter even excluding these significant items our results are not as strong as we aspire to but the strength of the franchise is still evident theres certainly some areas of success but the opportunity to improve our results is significant and attainable let me first share some of my observations and thoughts before turning it over to john first i was honored to be chosen to lead wells fargo because i believe this is an extraordinary company that plays an important role in this country we came out of the financial crisis as the most valuable and most respected bank in the us but as you know we made some terrible mistakes and have not effectively addressed our shortcomings these circumstances have led to financial underperformance but we have one of the most wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 enviable financial services franchises in the world and employees that want to do whats necessary to again be one of the most respected and successful banks in the us to fully capture this opportunity we must have a strong foundation and move with an extreme sense of urgency to remediate our historical issues we still have much more work to do to put these issues behind us and our future depends on us doing this successfully so we can regain trust with all stakeholders including our clients regulators lawmakers as well as the broader american population ultimately our actions will dictate when that trust is completely regained not our words given the importance of these issues i want to say a few more words about our situation particularly about the challenges that stand in the way of our success and importantly the different approach were taking to address these issues providing an honest assessment and clear priorities is critical and ive given a clear message inside the company that we have not yet met our own expectations or the expectations of others we must do whats necessary to put these issues behind us our ability to maximize the value of this great franchise is dependent on us running the company with the highest standards of operational excellence and integrity beyond what weve done todate we are appropriately a highly regulated institution and while we need to fulfill regulatory expectations we recognize that what we want and what regulators want are not different we are responsible for our actions and theyre responsible for ensuring our actions are consistent with clearly defined standards its our job to run the company such that we fulfill their expectations and those of the american public and other countries where we operate respect was earned in the past and we will earn it again as such since joining ive been spending almost all of my time on these issues i will say this several times but you should know there is still much work to do many have focused on the fed consent order but remember we have public enforcement actions that require significant resource commitment while i certainly wish more of this work was behind us whats required of us is clear and we will get it done its work that other banks have done already so there is a clear road map for what we need to achieve were making significant changes to our management structure and processes to accomplish our work changes that will make us more effective like any other problem recognition of the importance and severity is a necessary first step but this by itself is inadequate we will take whatever actions are necessary our future success depends on resolving these issues so we will act accordingly the management team will be judged and held accountable for resolving these issues to set us up for success we will ensure we have the right people in place to both resolve these issues and be the stewards of this great company importantly i want to acknowledge that we have so many wonderful people at wells fargo that have done an amazing job serving our clients and customers in the face of adversity for several years now theyve been through so much and have helped us sustain such a great franchise so i do want to say thank you to them for all theyve done the warmth and support ive been greeted with as ive discussed our shortcomings and work in front of us tells a great deal about the character of many at the company they understand our lack of progress makes their jobs far more difficult and theyre looking to management to do more to move the company forward to get the work done we must ensure that we have the right team to that end weve made some important changes to the senior team to complement the talent thats here at wells scott powell joined us as chief operating officer when i arrived at the company many on the senior management team made clear to me that wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 they believed we needed stronger execution skills after just several weeks at the company i came to quickly agree scott will lead a transformation across the company where high quality execution clear accountability and operational excellence becomes part of our culture bill daley joined as head of public affairs he has a strong and experienced voice and brings perspectives from the public sector that we in business do not generally have but are critical for us as we make decisions allen parker who served both as general counsel and interim ceo announced he will be leaving wells in march we are well into a search for the new general counsel and excited about the quality of the candidates weve met avid modjtabai has announced that she will be retiring after years at wells fargo in march we will be announcing a new organizational structure for these activities shortly ray fischer has also joined us to run our card and merchant services businesses our card business is important to our franchise and we have an opportunity to make it even more significant ray is an experienced card and merchant services executive who brings deep knowledge and a fresh perspective to our business these changes are in addition to many other senior people who have joined the company over the past few years in important roles such as heads of risk hr internal audit and technology these new additions complement the strong talent at the company and i will continue to look at the structure and roles to ensure we are best positioned for success we need and will have the best talent and strong leadership at the company were also introducing a new set of disciplines in how we run the company which im confident will improve our performance these changes are not only structural and procedural but also cultural to that point parts of our culture are wonderful and it would take decades to recreate people who work here love it it really is like a second family we focus on teamwork not on the individual people want to be successful and do whats right though we recognize weve fallen short of this goal but our lack of progress and underperformance point to shortcomings going forward we will operate as one company not a series of decentralized businesses we will continue to foster a culture of partnership but we will move past the need for consensus and have open and direct factbased discussions where we emerge with decisions we will have a different level of management discipline than weve had in the past and well value and expect high quality execution there will be clear responsibility and accountability we will judge ourselves based upon our outcomes not our words and we will ultimately judge ourselves versus the best as we believe that we should be the best as weve begun to implement this new culture the response has been overwhelmingly supportive but i understand its different and is a significant change for many we will be respectful of our past and of those who have built this great franchise which includes so many still at the company today but we must move forward im confident these changes will be highly impactful and though i understand you would like timeframes around resolution i cannot provide that today our job is to do the work thats necessary regulators and other stakeholders will determine when its done to their satisfaction my experience is that our regulators are clear direct tough but fair the work is on us at this point let me now turn to our medium and longerterm opportunities our franchises are worldclass and are in the sweet spot of providing necessary financial services for consumers small businesses and middle market and large corporate companies and importantly we play an important role in helping our customers and clients prosper as well as being an important enabler for us economic growth while ive spoken at length of our wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 mistakes and our commitments to fix them the underlying franchise itself is as valuable as ever and our opportunities are greater than ever the success of our business model is proven assuming we run the company with the appropriate controls and work as one company with the goal of delivering for all stakeholders all of our business segments community banking wealth and investment management and wholesale have the breadth and scale that gives us significant competitive advantage and allow us to deliver truly differentiated products and experiences for our customers and clients our opportunity to use technology to drive both automation and new solutions will only grow in importance our franchises both individually and collectively are the envy of many so while our resources and attention today are appropriately preoccupied with historical issues as we move forward we will be in a position to leverage our unique franchise and generate stronger financial results and just to be clear we are well aware that our expense levels are significantly too high part of this is driven by significant project expense related to historical issues part is due to the necessary investments in technology part is due to significant inefficiencies that exist across the organization but there is no reason why we shouldnt have bestin class efficiency with these businesses at this scale and that ultimately will be our goal and though weve had pockets of strong performance were also well aware that our rate of customer and revenue growth is too low given what weve been through this isnt surprising there is certainly an opportunity cost due to the asset cap management time and resources have not been as focused on growth as they otherwise would have been and we have an opportunity to think differently with a different level of rigor about how to grow the franchise all of this points to great opportunity so again i know you will want to know timeframes and targets but please understand that its too early after less than three months at the company that said we have just begun the process to rethink our plans for and beyond in a different level of detail while the opportunities for improvement are clear at the macro level we need businessbybusiness plans accordingly we have just begun conducting what are really both budget and broader business reviews where we look in detail at our plans we will be reviewing over businesses in detail as well as all of our enterprise functions as you can imagine technology is an important theme this isnt merely a review of the numbers but one where we use the facts to form a basis to discuss strategy and potential actions we are asking each business leader to show us what bestinclass efficiency looks like and what our path to achieve it is were reviewing revenue and return performance as well and what a path to bestclass looks like here as well were discussing our competitors large and small and were thinking through our unique options given our special franchise these are analytical and strategic discussions that i dont think have occurred consistently across the company in some time given whats occurred the output of this work will provide us roadmaps to not only improve our performance within each business but also position us to understand our opportunities across the company and prioritize accordingly first and foremost this includes clarity around ensuring were spending appropriately on historical issues its still very early in our process but i will say that every session thus far has reinforced that our opportunities are meaningful we intend to be detailed thoughtful and complete to do this properly and given our priorities it will take time much of this year to complete our work but in the interim we will devote all necessary resources to risk control and spend whats necessary we will be as diligent as ever to drive efficiencies and control expenses and we will begin to work through the business opportunities we have in front of us im confident in our ability to realize our potential one that again puts us at wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 the top of the respected financial institution list with a far more efficient organization and higher revenue growth than you see today while there is much to do and i know the path to success will be bumpy im optimistic about our future and excited to be at a place with so many great people and such strong franchises doing incredibly important work john over to you john r shrewsberry senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thanks charlie good morning everyone we had a number of significant items in the fourth quarter that impacted our results which we highlight on page of our supplement we had billion of operating losses including billion of litigation accruals for a variety of matters including previously disclosed retail sales practice matters the litigation accruals reduced eps by per share and the majority of them were not tax deductible we had a million gain from the sale of our commercial real estate brokerage business eastdil secured we had million of expenses related to the strategic reassessment of technology projects in wealth and investment management we had a million linkedquarter decrease in lowincome housing tax credit investment income reflecting a timing change of expected tax benefit recognition we had a million gain on loan sales predominantly junior lien mortgages and we had a million loan loss reserve release while our financial results in the fourth quarter were impacted by these items as we show on page we continued to have positive business momentum with strong customer activity which ill highlight throughout the call on page we summarize the fullyear results compared with revenue declined as growth in non interest income was more than offset by a decline in net interest income driven by lower interest rates our expenses remained too high and increased from a year ago driven by higher personnel expense which included million of higher deferred comp expense which is pl neutral and higher operating losses loans grew and deposits increased from a year ago our net chargeoff rate remained near historic lows and we returned a total of billion to shareholders in through common stock dividends and net share repurchases reducing common shares outstanding by ill be highlighting most of the balance sheet drivers on page throughout the call but i will note here that we were billion below the asset cap at the end of the fourth quarter turning to page ill be covering the income statement drivers throughout the call but i want to highlight that our effective income tax rate was in the fourth quarter which included a net discrete income tax expense of million predominantly related to the nontaxdeductible treatment of certain litigation accruals turning to page average loans increased linked quarter and year over year with growth in both consumer and commercial loans periodend loans increased billion from a year ago even as we sold or moved to heldfor sale a total of billion of consumer loans over the past year ill highlight the drivers of the linkedquarter growth in loans starting on page commercial loans increased billion from the third quarter driven by broadbased ci growth in corporate and investment banking as we show on page consumer loans grew billion from the third quarter the first mortgage loan portfolio increased billion from the prior quarter driven by billion of heldforinvestment mortgage loan wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 originations and the purchase of billion of loans as a result of exercising servicer cleanup calls were now substantially done with our cleanup call program for pre2008 securitizations junior lien mortgage loans were down billion from the third quarter as paydowns continued to outpace new originations credit card loans increased billion primarily due to seasonality our auto portfolio continued to grow with balances up billion from the third quarter originations were down linked quarter on seasonality but increased from a year ago reflecting a renewed emphasis on growing auto loans following the restructuring of the business turning to deposits on page average deposit costs increased from the third quarter and from a year ago our average deposit cost of basis points increased basis points from a year ago reflecting promotional pricing in retail banking for new deposits earlier in the year and the mix shift to higher cost products across our consumer and commercial businesses our average deposit costs declined basis points from the third quarter reflecting lower rates in wholesale banking and wim we did not run any broadbased retail banking marketing promotions for deposits during the fourth quarter however retail banking deposits increased basis points due to the continued impact from previous promotional campaigns and deposit gathering strategies over the past year when interest rates were higher while we continue to offer our customers competitive promotional savings and cd rates within our branches retail banking deposit costs are expected to start to decline in the first quarter as higher promotional rates expire on page we provide details on periodend deposits which grew from a year ago and from the third quarter wholesale banking deposits were up billion from the third quarter driven by seasonality and growth in existing and new customer balances consumer and small business banking deposits increased billion from the third quarter driven by higher retail banking deposits including growth in highyield savings and interest bearing checking wealth and investment management deposits grew as brokerage clients reallocation of cash into higheryielding liquid alternatives moderated during the quarter these increases were partially offset by lower corporate treasury and mortgage escrow deposits net interest income declined million from the third quarter primarily due to balance sheet repricing driven by the impact of the lower interest rate environment million of lower hedge and effectiveness accounting results as well as million of higher mbs premium amortization costs due to higher prepayment rates we had million of mbs premium amortization in the fourth quarter and based on the current interest rate environment we expect mbs premium amortization to be relatively stable in the first quarter and then start to decline although we expect it to be higher in full year compared with full year as expected net interest income was down in compared with and we continue to expect net interest income to decline in the low to midsingle digits in however as always net interest income will be influenced by a number of factors including loan and deposit growth rates pricing spreads the level of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve turning to page noninterest income declined billion from the third quarter which included a billion gain from the sale of our institutional retirement and trust business let me highlight a few of the other linked quarter trends we completed the sale of eastdil secured on october resulting in a million gain that was reflected in other noninterest income this sale reduced commercial real estate brokerage commissions by wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 million from the third quarter we provide a breakout of the revenue and direct expense related to this business on page in the appendix were assessing all of our businesses as part of the reviews were having since charlie joined wells fargo and there may be additional pruning going forward as we assess our strategic priorities mortgage banking revenue increased million from the third quarter servicing income was up million due to a negative msr valuation adjustment in the third quarter reflecting higher prepayment rates net gains on mortgage originations increased million due to a billion increase in residential heldforsale mortgage loan originations while the production margin was flat at basis points net gains on mortgage loan originations also increased from higher gains associated with exercising servicer cleanup calls in the fourth quarter we expect mortgage originations to be lower in the first quarter due to normal seasonality net gains from equity securities were down million from the third quarter as lower gains from our affiliated venture capital and private equity partnerships were partially offset by a million increase in deferred comp plan investment results which again are largely pl neutral turning to expenses on page our expenses were too high and becoming more efficient remains a top priority i will explain the drivers of the linked quarter and yearoveryear increases in more detail starting on page expenses increased million from the third quarter driven by higher personnel and equipment expense the million increase in compensation and benefits was driven by million of higher deferred comp plan expense we also had higher salaries expense primarily due to changes in staffing mix which was partially offset by lower fte as a reminder we will have seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter reflecting incentive compensation and employee benefits expense infrastructure expense increased due to higher equipment expense driven by the strategic reassessment of technology projects in wim our operating losses remained elevated but were stable linked quarter as we show on page expenses increased billion from a year ago driven by higher personnel expense and operating losses comp and benefits expense increased billion which included million of higher deferred comp expense as well as higher salaries expense primarily due to staffing mix changes and annual salary increase running the business nondiscretionary expense increased by billion of higher operating losses partially offset by lower core deposit and other intangibles amortization expense on the earnings call last quarter we said we expected our expenses to be approximately billion which was at the high end of our billion to billion target range as we showed on page we came in above that as fourth quarter expenses were higher than expected primarily in three areas first we had higher than forecasted outside professional services expense these expenses were primarily related to legal technology and risk management second we had higher impairments and other writedowns including the strategic reassessment of technology projects in wim that i previously mentioned as well as impairments on railcars finally we had higher personnelrelated accruals including severance turning to our business segments starting on page community banking earnings declined million from the third quarter primarily driven by lower net interest income and lower net gains from equity securities on page we provide our community banking metrics we had million digital active customers in the fourth quarter up from a year ago including growth in mobile active customers from a year ago primary consumer checking customers grew from a year ago the ninth consecutive quarter of yearoveryear growth branch customer experience survey scores in december increased from a year ago reflecting the wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 fundamental changes weve made to improve the customer experience the decline in branch customer experience survey scores from the third quarter was most likely due to changes in branch staffing levels were pleased that the progress weve been making to improve customer satisfaction was reflected in the jd power national banking satisfaction study released in december our customer satisfaction scores improved by points from last years study the largest increase among our large bank peers improving the customer experience across wells fargo remains a priority and as part of this focus were implementing the net promoter system to allow even more dynamic customer feedback and benchmarking as a result of this implementation well no longer be reporting branch customer experience survey scores however we will continue to share key business drivers that reflect the progress were making to improve the customer experience and to drive loyalty turning to page teller and atm transactions declined from a year ago as a result of our customers continuing to migrate to digital channels we consolidated branches in we had branches at the end of down over the past three years we also continue to have strong card usage with linked quarter and yearoveryear growth in both credit and debit card purchase volume turning to page wholesale banking earnings declined million from the third quarter driven by lower revenue were an industry leader in businesses that support lowincome housing and renewable energy investments which both generate income tax credits these income tax benefits do not get included in revenue so as you can see in the table on this page were reporting both our consistent wholesale efficiency ratio and were also providing our efficiency ratio adjusted for income tax credits in order to make this ratio more reflective of how we evaluate the business wealth and investment management earnings declined billion from the third quarter which included a billion pretax gain from the sale of our institutional retirement and trust business for the first time since the first quarter of wim had linked quarter growth in average deposits up from the third quarter and total client assets increased from a year ago on higher market valuations including growth in retail brokerage advisory assets closed referred investment assets resulting from the partnership between wim and community banking were up in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago with december having over billion in closed referrals our strongest month since june of turning to page we continue to have strong credit results with basis points of net chargeoffs in the fourth quarter commercial losses were basis points up basis points from the third quarter driven by lower recoveries and higher losses in lease financing primarily related to railcars overall credit quality indicators in our commercial portfolio remain strong with our fourth quarter internal credit grades at their strongest levels in two years consumer losses were basis points also up basis points from the third quarter both of our consumer real estate portfolios were in a net recovery position in the fourth quarter our other consumer portfolios had slight increases in losses from the third quarter primarily driven by seasonality both our credit card and auto portfolios had lower loss rates than a year ago nonaccrual loans declined million from the third quarter with lower nonaccruals in both the commercial and consumer portfolios nonaccrual loans were basis points of total loans in the fourth quarter their lowest level in over years we adopted cecl on january of this year and expect to recognize a billion reduction in our allowance and a corresponding increase in retained earnings this reduction predominantly reflects an expected billion wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 reduction in the allowance for commercial credit losses under cecl reflecting shorter contractual maturities and the benign credit environment while the allowance for consumer credit losses is expected to be billion higher under cecl reflecting longer or indeterminate maturities net of recoveries and collateral value predominantly related to residential mortgage loans which had been written down significantly below current recovery value during the last credit cycle as weve noted in prior quarters we anticipate more volatility under cecl due to economically sensitive forecast and the impact of changes in the credit cycle turning to capital on page our cet1 ratio decreased to driven by returning billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the fourth quarter our ratio was still well above both the regulatory minimum of and our current internal target of as a reminder we used approximately of the gross repurchase capacity under our most recent capital plan in the second half of so repurchases will be lower during the first two quarters of in summary while we had a number of significant items that impacted our fourth quarter financial results and our expenses remain too high we continue to have positive underlying business fundamentals including growth in loans and deposits increased customer activity and strong credit performance we also had high capital returns im excited about the opportunities ahead as we continue to do the work necessary to transform wells fargo and charlie and i will now take your questions question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research john eamon mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co good morning john john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co good morning john john eamon mcdonald q analyst autonomous research charlie i wanted to ask you maybe for some highlevel takeaways on wells fargos technology where do you see it being up to par and bestinclass and what areas do you see the technology is behind and needing more investment charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 thanks john its a great question again im certainly not in a position to be definitive across the board given how ive been spending my time i will say that in the time that i spent with saul van beurden who is our head of technology at the company we have a really clear list of the work that we have to do to both improve the underlying infrastructure of the institution which will benefit our ability to grow at some point because it really contributes to our ability to servicing all of our clients across all of our different segments as well as we possibly can and so its a robust list there is a lot to do on it and saul clearly is working through with this team all the right prioritization and putting time frames around it at the same time its clear when i spend time with all of our folks that we are thinking about where we go next and how we use technology to create different experiences and we see it in terms of some of the things that weve done in the digital space on the consumer side and so again im not in the position to be extremely specific business by business of exactly where were positioned and how we think about it other than its really clear that it has been a top priority inside the company and certainly all of the business leaders understand the importance that technology will play going forward hope this helps john john eamon mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then wanted to ask john shrewsberry in terms of expenses totally getting charlies point about being too early to talk about expense improvement but when we think about the jumping off point as we put our models for expenses john should we think about this billion adjusted expenses that you did for is that a good starting point to think about expenses in the last you kind of said youd try to be flat in is that the right ballpark we should be thinking about for the adjusted number john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah so early on here while were still going through this planning process i wouldnt expect that much to change other than the some of the adjustments that we all made for deferred comp for excess operating losses et cetera and then as this process ensues well come back with some more detail john eamon mcdonald q analyst autonomous research but for now were kind of thinking flattish to that number or thats the right ballpark to start off with john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co i would just take it period by period not that much is going to change between  and  the same because of the shortness of the timeframe and as we get more clarity as a result of our process well provide more clarity john eamon mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then just one just quick followup on that in terms of the million of operating losses that you talked about it really hasnt been that in many years its really average it seems like more like billion a year i know its hard to predict but to worry about us anchoring too low on that million should we kind of budget something higher than that just as a goforward wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thats a good point so when we originally talked about the million it reflected the million per quarter of fraudrelated losses and other run rate operating losses without regard for whats been elevated over the last couple of years i do think that the million has probably grown to be something a little bit more like it could be million or million well try and give better guidance to that but the higher run rate or the higher realized rate that weve had over the last two years reflects more of a combination of episodic things that are anticipated to recur at the same level and let me give you just on your first question a little bit more clarity because im reminded that the first quarter is the first quarter i said this in my remarks but there are seasonally elevated expenses in the first quarter that stand out year after year as fica resets as retirement eligibility resets and a few other things that will cause that to stand out in any year john eamon mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got you okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi thanks good morning thanks for taking the questions charlie on your points about just going after all the things to put the company on the right foot forward how do you start to assess just if the right things are happening underneath and coming back to the point just on related expenses youve obviously had this build over time of compliance and risk and those functions are we even at the point yet where the hiring is done in that regard right where youre actually just you got the people in place and its more just about execution how do you give us a sense of just kind of where you think you are on that story arc thanks charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure so on the first question listen i think when youre on the inside of the company and were managing the work that has to get done the way that we are we have clear reporting we have clear goals item by item by item and so its very very easy for us to understand whether were tracking to milestones and having reviewed the entire plan believe that those milestones will get us to eventual closure on issues quite honestly from the outside you obviously dont have the ability to do that thats not something that we can provide to you so ultimately what youre going to have to look for are closure of these issues and as time goes on that is what we hope to accomplish and that ultimately will be success as well on your second question about where are we i guess in terms of the build of expenses necessary to accomplish the work again i would say on that one we cant sit here today and say i cant sit here today and say that the amount that were spending and the people that we have is totally appropriate and by the way dont take that to mean its too high its area by area weve added a lot of resources we need to understand whether weve wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 added the right resources whether we have people working together as well as we possibly can understanding things that weve built manually to understand where we can go to automate those items which will make us not only just far more efficient but far more effective and so again when i say its really too early to be definitive about where we think about the level of expenses and whats appropriate i put this into the same bucket but again i just want to be really clear about this we dont sit here and believe that we have carte blanche to spend whatever we possibly want on any issue we are going to spend whats necessary on these historical issues and you should assume that we will be extremely vigilant about ensuring that were not only thinking about our future but thinking about our shareholders in terms of where it all nets out ultimately ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood charlie and just one followup on your point a couple months in you said youre going to look at like business lines and just see where you should think about things from a bottomup from what you see now is the company what it needs to look like going forward the company has been trimming out of some areas over the course of time do you think that all the businesses the company has today deserve to be inside the company from a goforward basis thanks for that charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah sure i would say as far as the big pieces of the company absolutely when we look at the benefits that our clients get from having the combination of consumer businesses wealth businesses and wholesale businesses under one roof are significant today and as we look to the future we believe they should be even more significant and so at that level i would say absolutely as john did mention in his remarks we have been pruning and as we go through these reviews and talk about some of the smaller things that we do it is a good opportunity to ask do we need to continue to do all of these things will they make a difference first to our clients and ultimately to us and so i would expect to have some things come out of that but i put them in the category of pruning at this point ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it thanks charlie charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning i wanted to follow up on the line of questioning that ken just had charlie so it sounds like as we think about what you mentioned during your prepared remarks as you focus on remediation and investment it sounds like theres also room to focus on inefficiencies at the same time in particular a lot of your investors have pointed out that your head count hasnt moved much over the past years and your head count is similar to wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 another peer that is producing about billion more in revenue than you so i just wanted i know that sounded more like a statement but the question really is is there room to also address some of the efficiencies as you think about remediation and investment charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co i think again what i want to make sure that im at least being clear about is that i think that we have we want to be able to think with as clean a sheet as possible about how we should be spending our money and so that goes to asking the question are we spending appropriately on the historical issues and that number will be whatever we think it should be absolutely we will focus on efficiency and i want to give just i havent said this in my remarks but it is important its not as if its not something the company is focused on and so when we look at all the additional resources that have been added to support these activities its very difficult for you all to see what we have gained in terms of efficiency because you should just assume that our expenses would be substantially higher if we hadnt been generating efficiencies in the rest of the company over the last several years but having said that with fresh eyes i get to show up and take a look and ask a whole series of questions as do some of the other new folks that have come in and there are still big parts of the company where we are extraordinarily inefficient and to be fair its not just my eyes and the new folks eyes but its what the existing management team has talked about as well so we do believe there are significant opportunities and while the first priority is fixing the issues of the past we should be able to continue to work towards both and i do want to throw in the last category which is important which is we are thinking about the future and while time and conscious are weighted more towards the past were not ignoring the future and so if we do see there are opportunities which are meaningful we want to have the latitude to think about how we can spend wisely on that and so thats why were just being very very careful about leading you to a specific number because were not sure where that all nets itself out and we want the time to be thoughtful about how to put it all together in a way that we certainly believe is the right longterm thing for the company again very conscious of the fact that were stewards of the company and there are owners out there and other stakeholders that we have to answer to erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch understood and my second question is as you mentioned it youll be announcing a new org structure shortly does that include the hires that you highlighted during your prepared remarks or could we anticipate more changes to the operating committee from here charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co i think what i said is what i said which is avids retiring she is responsible for a whole series of things from deposits to treasury services to card to innovation digital marketing a very very wide range of things and were actively working through what the right way to structure the company is with her retirement and when weve completed that we will certainly make sure that you all know about what it looks like erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 got it and just if i could squeeze in a third question hear you loud and clear that the closure of the issues is one way your investors and other stakeholders could measure progress at the company as we think about the end of the year what other measures of progress would you suggest your current and prospective shareholders could use to measure progress or is one year simply too short of a time given the transformation that you believe the company will go through charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah i guess let me say a couple of words and john could add anything that hed like again i think its important we have a lot going on and ive been here for a short time and so we feel extremely optimistic about that medium and longterm but we have a lot to figure out and as i pointed out some of it takes months and some of it will take a little bit longer than that so i think answering the question of what that all looks like by the end of the year at this point is even premature but just know that were focused on outcomes here john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co i think well be talking about realized results and what drove them over the course of the year including closure of issues to the extent that those are public items and then how we set ourselves up and our stakeholders up for what comes next so as this process goes on and concludes and we have a better line of sight on what happens end of year next year et cetera then well begin to share that that will be progress charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and i just i dont want to dwell on it but i just want to be clear im not suggesting here that any of these public issues will be closed this year what im suggesting is that were going to do all the work thats required the time frames will be driven by when we accomplish that work and when the regulators are satisfied by it as i said theres a great deal of it some have a certain level of complexity to them and were focused on the work at this point erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning still another question on the regulatory side i think one of the things the regulators always had said is they wanted to see a change in the culture at the bank as a sign that things are improving i mean is that still an outstanding item that needs to be addressed or has it been addressed already charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co well listen i think i addressed some of this in my remarks that were prepared and i think as an outsider coming in i do have the opportunity to make some observations of some of the things that we do versus some of the things that ive seen that could help make a company successful going through issues that are somewhat like this wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 and so i do think that these changes that i spoke about are important to helping us be more successful at closing these issues in a way that has eluded us to this point brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then the second question just on the numbers themselves i mean if you look at john maybe on the commercial loans youve seen decent growth now or i should say some growth year over year and that portfolio looks like pieces of that are coming from the nonus also coming from this credit investment portfolio can you guys give an update on the ci lending side of it whats this growth in the nonus where is that coming from and then how do you see these loan clos and whats the total clo exposure at this time john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co sure so on the second part first the total clo exposure is about billion i think at this point which hasnt changed much this approach of investing in them in loan form is really just its a more accountingfriendly approach its the same risk reward otherwise and so weve made the shifts part of our incremental investment still an asset class that we feel comfortable with the risk reward in in spite of where we are in the cycle and for other reasons the bulk of the ci loan growth overall did come from commercial or corporate investment bankingrelated activity so some of its in the assetbacked finance area things like clos and then also with major corporate customers but on probably not permanent funding well fund an activity a strategic activity that ultimately would likely to get taken out in the capital markets subsequently so its not so much coming from the funded term loan segment of commercial banking for example and i wouldnt agree too much of the growth in nonus loans thats because that will ebb and flow a little bit but its not likely to be a big driver of loan growth one way or the other in the foreseeable future brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks operator your next question comes from the line of marty mosby with vining sparks marty mosby q analyst vining sparks ibg lp thanks john i want to ask you first this billion is a big number for this particular quarter youve been addressing these issues you cant talk specifically but generally was there some event what was the catalyst for all of a sudden recognizing another significant or meaningful slug of onetime extraordinary costs john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co sure i mean i cant talk too much about specific active litigation but in general these amounts get recorded when the items become both probable and estimable so weve had elevated costs in this area for the last two quarters as a result of greater estimability of what outcomes might be wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 marty mosby q analyst vining sparks ibg lp and then charlie when youre coming over now and your statement that you went through initially kind of forwardly said we havent addressed or wells fargo hasnt addressed these issues at the pace or in the way that they should have in order to make the progress kind of how do you look at assessing where some of these things went wrong i mean again just generally and maybe not specifically but you would have thought over these years there would have been a lot of attention and a lot of progress and it just doesnt seem like thats been the case so your assessment of it seems pretty critical so i was just trying to figure out how to put some context around that charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yes i guess listen the way i would the way i think about it is that ive when i have the opportunity to come in and look at where we are my judgments are based upon where we actually are i havent i dont think theres a whole lot of value in terms of when i have to figure out how to spend my time in going back and figuring out if i was here what i might have done differently im not sure i would have done anything necessarily differently i wasnt in the seat i dont know what the priorities were i dont know what else was going on that is a very very difficult thing to do and generally something thats very very unfair to do so again i think whats relevant is that ive been able to come in with this fresh set of eyes believe that we have an opportunity to manage these blocks of work differently with both a different set of processes some different people and a great deal of my time and attention as well as the rest of the senior management team and based upon the experience that ive had in executing operational things as well as the other members of the team that we have in place now and understanding the work that we have to do i do feel confident that we can get it done and thats been my focus marty mosby q analyst vining sparks ibg lp and i guess maybe a different way to think about it is when youve seen these things happen in the past would you couch it as that maybe there is a new standard in which wells fargo is going to be held accountable to kind of develop toward in order to set the new standard for the industry so in other words when the regulators get in on a bank they then really begin to kind of figure out where they want everybody else to kind of head to so its not like youre just catching up with everybody else maybe theres surpassing and creating a more forward kind of model that theyre wanting to get to so i didnt know is there that part of it as well or is this just still catching up with everybody else charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co listen i think ive got a lot to do to speak on behalf of wells fargo and so it certainly wouldnt be right for me to speak for regulators but i do think that we have the opportunity to raise the standard by which we view the importance of the work the manner in which we go about doing it and the way we hold each other accountable for getting it done and so again that is my focus marty mosby q analyst vining sparks ibg lp thanks wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 operator your next question comes from the line of saul martinez with ubs saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning guys speaking of things you need to do to get closure on some of these issues i think in the past youve talked about close to processes i think john you mentioned high singledigit thousands of processes where youre identifying individual risk controls and where needed remediating those risk and control functions can you just give us a sense of where you are in that process what kind of progress youve made more recently and i guess importantly how is your relationship with your regulators evolving as you kind of go through this and work through a lot of these individual processes john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah on the first part so not all 9000plus processes are created equally theyre risk scored and or importance scored for their impact and were ahead of where we anticipated being by the end of the year i dont have the exact number in front of me but the of those that are most impactful they will have been as weve described mapped risk ided control ided controls developed where controls didnt previously exist testing over those controls put in place in the first half by the end of the first half of this year thats how that looks right now and i think its to the satisfaction of the people who are watching us do it saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay okay thats helpful so it feels like youre making good progress on the major on the more significant processes john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yes saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc so changing gears a little bit you took i think a million charge for reassessing technology projects in wealth and investment management can you just give a sense what drove that decision and whether we should be thinking that there could be other it projects that youre looking at reassessing and cutting going forward john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co sure so jon weiss has substantially reconstituted the leadership team in wim and theyve set their strategic priorities and direction and theyre different than what had been under development in terms of the technology to support different parts of the business over the last few years which is what resulted in the impairment to the capitalized software development costs i wouldnt anticipate seeing a lot more of that and to be honest we dont have an extraordinary amount of capitalized software development costs so the risk isnt that great from an accounting perspective wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it if i could just squeeze one more quick one in john just on fees the core fee lines deposits trust card mortgages in general it seems like the momentum has improved a bit in recent quarters but can you just give us a sense and im not asking for specific guidance but can you just talk directionally about whether theres any reason to think you cant grow from fourth quarter levels obviously recognizing theres seasonality in a lot of these businesses but are these like good core run rates to use and do you feel good about your ability to grow some of these line items john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co the trust and investment fees should step off at a high level because they price off of the opening tick which for the sp looks good for the coming quarter that leverage it creates cyclicality that works for us and against us mortgage as we said its probably going to be a lighter quarter in the first quarter just because of seasonality it was stronger in the fourth quarter than it would have seasonally been expected to be but the pipeline suggests that itll be somewhat smaller on the origination side in the first quarter card fees tick up because theres more consumer spending going on in the fourth quarter so id expect that to be more seasonally appropriate in the first quarter and then its hard to forecast trading activity it certainly was stronger yearoveryear in the fourth quarter because of the bloodbath in the fourth quarter of but it was weaker third quarter to fourth quarter in and historically the first quarter is a stronger quarter as a result of asset managers reallocating and people getting invested in the first quarter so well see what happens there its tougher to predict but those are the types of things that are likely to influence things that are a little bit more ratable like deposit service charges or loan fees et cetera i would anticipate i dont think therell be much change from quartertoquarter saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thats helpful thank you john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yes operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you and good morning john can you share with us i think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expected the net interest income to be down low to mid singledigits for over can you compare for us whats the driver of that visàvis what drove the decline in is it more having less higher yielding assets like the pickapay loans on the books in or is it a margin compression issue can you give us some color there john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 yeah so its a handful of things but it was a bigger drop in because of i would say the original uptick in premium amortization on the mbs portfolio that and im not giving this to you on order of priority but just in terms of inputs the legdown in libor obviously had a big impact in thats expected to be a little flatter at this point as were looking into we talked about retail deposits or pardon me retail deposit pricing and how as rates were increasing we had put in place some promotions that have a little bit of a tail to them that tail was fully in place during and it will abate during all of those things but its rates right they dropped in theyre at least at the front end expected to be relatively flattish in gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i see and i think john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co it looks to be lets go over quick gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co the number of variables and the range of potential outcomes around those variables that goes into giving the low to midsingle digits is a lot can move as weve talked about i think we were quite close on our estimation for but well keep you updated as we roll along in on what its looking like based on what changes you mentioned pickapay i guess i should also point out that that was on a fullyear basis theres probably million worth of interest income coming off of the sold pickapay loans so thats worthy of mentioning to you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc right john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co that we dont have this year gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great could you also share with us you pointed out that you grew the primary consumer checking account deposit year over year what are you using as the hook to get customers to come in are there some incentives whether its a higher upfront cash deposit that you give them or is there gifts or how are you guys driving that growth john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 so that metric is the number of accounts not the deposits associated with the accounts which weve talked about separately gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co its the branch network its the digital acquisition the combination of those two things i wouldnt say that its specifically theres nothing thats compelling people the offers that we use are more around dollars for capturing additional deposits from customers but these account openings reflect the sort of everyday business model of community banking both in the branches and through digital activity gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then just real quickly you mentioned lower gains in the quarter from your venture capital private equity area whats left in unrealized gains in those two categories for you folks john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co so unrealized gains are harder to come by these days because we tend to realize them on a faster basis since the accounting change i guess now a yearandahalf ago it used to be the case that wed have to actually realize something to recognize the benefit something has to be sold or go public in order for us to take a gain and these days even with private companies doing subsequent private capital raises if they set a higher level of valuation we recognize the gain from that as it goes along and so when the ultimate realization occurs theres less of a pop because weve ratcheted up the weve taken gains along the way so thats led to more of a ill call it frontend loading over the last several quarters of benefit from that portfolio and it will increase the volatility if people have down capital raise rounds or things dont go as well when companies are actually sold or taken public so its been a great business the returns are solid but the accounting change has caused the revenue recognition to be a little bit more choppy although in the early quarters its actually been pretty strong gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you i appreciate the insights john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yes operator your next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 hey scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question i was hoping to try to drill down into the cost side once again i guess if were looking at an uptick in core expenses in the first quarter it implies a pretty substantial downdraft through the remainder of the year just to keep us in the ballpark of this years adjusted billion does the plan indeed call for such an absolute improvement in costs and whats sort of the path to get there especially at a time when theres so much discussion on investments just curious to hear your thoughts there john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah right so were not going to be that specific about the year as a whole my comment earlier about the first quarter is like every first quarter it tends to be the high tick for core expenses because of the way personnel costs have a first quarter uptick and so like any other year on an adjusted basis youd expect them to be higher in the first quarter and gravitate down over the course of the year but as charlie mentioned were going through a second look at our planning process for the year and so theres no fixed number at this point to point to since we are in the first quarter and since this happens every first quarter im calling out the fact that those personnel costs will be higher but there wont be much more specificity around that until weve completed this process and made some conclusions made some choices and come back and update people later in the year r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right so then rather than all right so even though i guess the billion is a place to start we shouldnt anticipate any sort of a flat trend or anything its basically tbd completely on what the expectation is for the full year is that correct john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co i think thats appropriate so that we dont mislead you yes r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay all right perfect thank you very much john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co youre welcome operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hi betsy wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i just wanted to understand on the planning process that charlie announced at the beginning i know charlie youre not talking about timeframes but youve seen a lot of different types of institutions and a lot of different types of scenarios and im wondering is this something that we should consider as i get to bestinclass on a three to fiveyear timeframe or is this more of a one to three im just trying to understand broad strokes your thought process there charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co listen i wish i could answer the question at this point but for all the reasons that ive spoken about im not in a position to do that i think we i dont want to be repetitive so i apologize but weve got to do the work to understand whether were appropriately resourced against the historical activities and then honestly as we go through these discussions in terms of how you get to bestinclass im sure businessbybusiness will be very very different in terms of what the timeframe is some of them will be structural some of them will require some significant technology investment others could be burdened by just inefficiencies that we can get to quicker so im not trying to be evasive i just betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc sure charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co i can see there being several different answers when we look at different parts of the company to what it will actually look like when were done with the work betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and does the work potentially have a result of exiting some of the businesses or do you think that thats really not on the table at this stage charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co i think ill repeat what i said before betsy i think that when you look at our big business segments there is tremendous sense because of the benefits our customers and clients get from them being under one roof but like any other company we should sit and ask the question do we need to be doing absolutely everything and we have been pruning along the way wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and theres probably still some more pruning that we should probably do betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right no thank you very much charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co good morning john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so john i was hoping to drill into some of the fee trends that you had spoken to in response to an earlier question certainly appreciate the detail you guys gave on slide helping us isolate some of the impacts from gains and other related sale impacts as we think about trying to evaluate the core fee income generation power just of the franchise today after adjusting for some of these sales if i look at that billion you guys produced this quarter i adjust for about million that you guys cited in the slide and then on top of that adjust for deferred comp other investment income adjustments we get to a run rate of roughly billion a quarter in core fee income generation i know youre going to have equity market tailwinds just from what happened in the fourth quarter as we enter the year in but im just hoping to frame whether that billion annualized run rate is a reasonable jumping off point after adjusting for some of those factors or anything else that you would cite for that matter john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 well so its not unreasonable in the sense that it captures the seasonal volatility of some of these things that tend to ebb and flow throughout the course of the year and if weve adjusted out things that we sold both from a gain perspective as well as the run rate perspective and it captures that we do have elements as youll note that ebb and flow relatively meaningfully from not just from quarter to quarter but from year to year and so we have had equity market tailwinds as you mentioned and we might continue to but that will come and go i tend to look at a slightly longer time horizon on some of those line items and think about what the average has been over five quarters or so since we reported in five quarters its easy enough to do theres nothing unreasonable about that approach there are some of these that we believe that even while were doing our work we should be driving and growing and then some that will reflect the cycle of the market that were in mortgage comes to mind in terms of where we are in the rate cycle and things like that steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got you no thanks for that color john and just one more followup for me i just wanted to clarify some of your capital guidance so i know that the last update that i can recall and im sorry if this is wrong or misguided you alluded to a to cet1 target that you guys were managing to that always felt quite conservative and in the earnings release you actually referred to an internal target of im just wondering as we think about future buyback and capital return plans has there been any change in the firms internal capital targets that you guys are ultimately managing to or how are you guys trying to think about that as you start to implement some of these changes that charlie was speaking to earlier john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah thats a good question were what weve been waiting for so specifically our internal guidelines is and that includes the buffer on top of the regulatory requirement weve been talking about something that could be to waiting for what to know what cecl looks like in stress and what the stress capital buffer guidelines actually look like once theyre implemented and theres a belief certainly because were getting more ccar clarity over the coming weeks that well start to know whether were going to know the answer to that this year and then its likely that the combination of those two things leads us to a slightly higher level it could be conservative but well know for sure once we are operating in the stress capital buffer world steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc great helpful color john thanks for taking my questions john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah you bet operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank matthew derek oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning im sure youre a little tired of all the expense questions kind of nearterm i do want to ask though longer term on costs charlie you said about being bestinclass efficiency and i guess just how do you define wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 that and i think a lot of investors and analysts think of your direct peers as being like bank of america jpmorgan maybe us bank as well but are you kind of being literal like your efficiency ratio should be in the ballpark or better than theirs and if it is its just a its a bold comment given where youre coming from and obviously reflects i assume optimism on both costs and revenue but maybe you can just elaborate on some of those themes thank you john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co sure were going businessbybusiness and selecting the peer group that best represents either the products or the segments that establish what bestinclass looks like so it could be the component pieces of our larger peers it could be the component pieces of regional banks and it could be the component indiscernible on what the business is and then for the company as a whole the weighted average the mixadjusted average of what those inputs are results in the outcome thats part of this review process that charlie had alluded to earlier and its definitely aspirational as we sit here today but that is the direction that were setting for ourselves as charlie mentioned for every business that were likely to be in over the longterm weve got all the benefits of scale working for us and very mature in most of them and we should there may be specific reasons and well address them if we find them why we cant compete effectively with the most efficient but thats what were setting our sights for matthew derek oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then without putting any specific numbers around it like as you think about improving efficiency there were comments that its going to be both kind of revenue and expenses should we think about it being somewhat balanced or the vast majority coming from expenses or too early to know right now john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co too early to know we know theres work to do on expenses but its too early to start attributing percentage driver for example matthew derek oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and just lastly charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hey matt its charlie let me just add one thing matthew derek oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co because i do think its important this isnt something that i would say that john and i sit here in a room and believe and then we get in a room with others and they argue with us there is a clear understanding from our wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 business leaders that this opportunity exists and i would say quite frankly theres very little conversation internally about the need to use revenue to improve the efficiency rate because we do understand that theres a series of things that we do that are highly inefficient thats not to say to get to bestinclass that we wont need some revenue growth to get there but i just find it very encouraging the way people internally are thinking about it and what theyre talking about as the types of things that will be in the line of sight matthew derek oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay all right thank you for that charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure operator your final question will come from the line of john pancari with evercore john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co good morning john charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co good morning john pancari q analyst evercore group llc on the spread income guidance of down low to mid singledigits i know you reiterated that but you also indicated that you are still pruning does that guidance factor in the pruning and accordingly any additional adjustments to your business base would not be all that meaningful to impact that guidance or would that guidance change if you did continue to prune john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co if we continue to prune in ways that caused us to shed either loans or deposits then we would adjust the guidance it contemplates the company as it exists today john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay all right i just wanted to verify and then in terms of cecl day impact i just wanted to get your thoughts on the appetite to lend in certain longer duration consumer areas has that been impacted at all by the implications of the new methodology wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 john r shrewsberry a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thats a good question weve done the work productbyproduct to consider what the return characteristics are and at this point its not likely that we change our appetite for longer duration consumer loans it definitely depending on where you are in the cycle it can cause you to think differently about what your returns are but it hasnt caused anything to drop below a hurdle level that says to us we need to either meaningfully reprice it or rethink whether were in the business john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay and then lastly just back to the expense expectations again i know its too early to give a more accurate expense expectation but i know youre going through your planning process so whats the timing when should we think we will get a more precise expectation when it comes to fullyear expenses charlie charles w scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah i guess theres nothing more that i can say that i havent already said i think what ive said is that weve got this process to go through theres a lot to do and when we know something well tell you i wish i could be more specific i really do but we have a lot to do to get to what we think the right answer should be john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it okay thanks charles w scharf president chief executive officer director wells fargo co all righty listen thank you very much for your patience and joining us this morning i do hope that you just walk away with just a couple of important thoughts we have work to do its clear what we have to do were committed to getting it done and we will get it done the quality of the franchise is still extraordinary we have thousands and thousands of dedicated people across the company that come in every day to serve their clients theyre doing an extraordinary job and were going to do our part to help them do their job even better as time goes on and we think our future is very bright and so we appreciate again the patience that you have and look forward to more conversations in the future
