mike to review fourth quarter results in more detail and some of our expectations for before we take your questions let me start with fourth quarter highlights our results were significantly impacted by previously disclosed operating losses but our underlying performance reflected the continued progress were making to improve returns rising interest rates drove strong net interest income growth our continued progress and our efficiency initiatives helped to drive expenses lower excluding operating losses loans grew in both our commercial and consumer portfolios and chargeoffs have continued to increase but credit quality remained strong our capital levels also remained very strong and our cet1 ratio increased to wellabove our required minimums plus buffers we also continued to make progress on putting legacy issues behind us our broadreaching agreement with the cfpb in december is an important step forward that helps us resolve multiple matters the majority of which have been outstanding for several years over the past three years we have made significant changes in the businesses referenced in the settlement and many of the required actions were already substantially complete prior to this announcement while our risk and regulatory work hasnt always followed a straight line and we have more to do weve made significant progress and we will continue to prioritize our work here in addition to our risk and regulatory work its also critical for us to continue to invest in the future as we build off the great market positions we have we are confident our processes will enable us to continue to prioritize our risk and control work at the same time that we invest in our future and as i look back in im enthusiastic about the progress weve made this past year and feel even better about the opportunities ahead let me start with the changes weve made during the year to help millions of customers avoid overdraft fees and meet shortterm cash needs these efforts included the elimination of non sufficient funds fees and transfer fees for customers enrolled in overdraft protection early pay day making eligible direct deposits available up to two days early extra day grace giving eligible customers an extra business day to make deposits to avoid overdraft fees and in the fourth quarter we launched flex loan a new digitalonly small dollar loan that provides eligible customers convenient and affordable access to funds teams from across the company came together to roll out this new product in record time the rollout has been smooth and though its still early customer response is exceeding our expectations these actions build on services weve introduced over the past several years including clear access banking our account with no overdraft fees we now have over million of those accounts up from a year ago we continued to transform the way we serve our customers by offering innovative products and solutions we continue to improve our credit card offerings including launching two new cards wells fargo autograph and bilt our new products help drive a increase in new credit card accounts in while we continued to maintain strong credit profiles we launched wells fargo premier our new offering dedicated to the financial needs of affluent clients by bringing together our branchbased and wealthbased businesses to provide a more comprehensive relevant and integrated offering for our clients we continued to enhance partnership within our commercial business to bring wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 corporate investment banking products such as foreign exchange and ma advisory services to our middle market clients our different approach to technology is helping us better serve our consumer and corporate clients we rolled out our new mobile app with a simpler more intuitive user experience which has improved customer satisfaction in mobile app to customers grew from a year ago we launched intuitive investor making it easier for customers to invest with a streamlined account opening process and a lower minimum investment and total active intuitive investor accounts increased from a year ago we completed the development of fargo our new aipowered virtual assistant that provides a more personalized convenient and simple banking experience which is currently live for eligible employees and set to begin rolling out to customers early this year last month we announced vantage our new enhanced digital experience for our commercial and corporate clients vantage uses ai and machine learning to provide a tailored and intuitive platform based on our clients specific needs over the past year our industryleading api platform team continued the development of payment apis for commercial and corporate clients invested in solutions to support our financial institution clients ramped up and grew product offerings in consumer lending and began developing commercial lending solutions we are investing heavily in modernizing the it infrastructure and the way we develop code were implementing a cloudnative operating model that allows us to innovate faster weve also been investing in modernization in the areas of payments and corporate lending taking out legacy applications and digitizing processes endtoend these enhanced digital capabilities are just the start of initiatives we have planned as part of our multiyear digital transformation were also continuing to evaluate our existing businesses as we announced earlier this week we plan to create a more focused home lending business aimed at serving primarily bank customers as well as individuals and families in minority communities this includes exiting the correspondent business and reducing the size of our servicing portfolio ive been saying for some time that the mortgage business has changed dramatically since the financial crisis and weve been adjusting our strategy accordingly were focused on our customers profitability returns and serving minority communities not volume or market share the mortgage product is important to our customer base and the communities we serve so it will remain important to us but we do not need to be one of the biggest originators or servicers in the industry to do this effectively across all of our businesses we must evolve as the market regulation and competition has evolved while it may seem counterintuitive we believe the decision to reduce risk in the mortgage business by reducing size and narrowing our focus will this will actually enable us to serve customers better and will also improve our returns in the long term changing gears now im proud of all we did last year to make progress on our environmental social and governance work we are balanced in our approach to these issues and believe that thinking broadly about our stakeholders will enhance returns for shareholders and we provide many examples on slide of our presentation so let me just highlight two examples here we published our first diversity equity and inclusion report which highlights the progress that weve made on our dei initiatives well continue to make progress in our commitment to integrating dei into every aspect of the company under the new leadership of kristy fercho who joined wells fargo in to lead our home lending business and was named the companys new head of diverse segments representation and inclusion in the fourth quarter weve commissioned an external thirdparty racial equity audit and we plan to publish the results of the assessment by the end of this year wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 was a turning point in the economic cycle the federal reserve has made clear that reducing inflation is its priority and it will continue to take actions necessary to achieve its goal we are starting to see the impact on consumer spend credit housing and demands for goods and services at this point the impact to consumers and businesses has been manageable and though there will certainly be some industries and segments of consumers that are more impacted than others the rate impact we see in our customer base is not materially im sorry the rate of impact we see in our customer base is not materially accelerating this plus the strength with which consumers and businesses went into this slowing economy is a helpful set of facts as we look forward our customers have remained resilient with deposit balances consumer spending and credit quality still stronger than prepandemic levels as we look forward were carefully watching the impact of higher rates on our customers and expect to see deposit balances and credit quality continue to return toward prepandemic levels while we are not predicting a severe downturn we must be prepared for one and we are stronger company today than one and two years ago our margins are wider our returns are higher were better managed and our capital position is strong so we feel prepared for a downside scenario if we see broader deterioration than we currently see or predict we still have clear opportunities to improve our performance as we make progress on our efficiency initiatives and continue to make the investments necessary to grow the business through technology and product enhancements two years ago we shared a path to a higher rotce by returning capital to our shareholders and executing on our efficiency initiatives while high levels of operating losses in the second half of impacted our results our underlying business performance demonstrated our ability to improve our returns in a moment mike will highlight the key drivers of our path to a rotce which we believe is achievable based on the strength of our business model and our ability to execute while were focused on improving our returns making progress on building the appropriate risk and control infrastructure for a company of our size and complexity will remain our top priority and we will dedicate the time and resources necessary i want to conclude by thanking our employees across the company who are working hard each day to continue to make progress in our transformation im excited about all that we will accomplish in the year ahead ill now turn the call over to mike michael p santomassimo senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thank you charlie and good morning everyone slides and summarize how we helped our customers communities and employees last year some of which charlie covered so im going to start with our fourth quarter financial results on slide net income for the fourth quarter was billion or per diluted common share our fourth quarter results included billion or per share of operating losses primarily related to a variety of previously disclosed historical matters including litigation regulatory and customer remediation billion of impairment of equity securities or million after noncontrolling interest predominantly in our affiliated venture capital business primarily driven by portfolio companies in the enterprise software sector both slowing revenue growth rates and lower public market valuations of enterprise software companies impact the valuations its important to note that even after recognizing this impairment the current value of these investments at the end of remained above the amount of the initial investment wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 million of severance expense primarily in home lending while weve reduced head count in this business throughout this charge includes the actions we plan to take in related to the mortgage announcement we made earlier this week these reductions were partially offset by million of discrete tax benefits related to interest on overpayments in prior years we highlight capital on slide our cet1 ratio is up approximately basis points from the third quarter reflecting the benefit from our fourth quarter earnings the annual share issuance for our 401k plan matching contribution and an increase from aoci our cet1 ratio remained wellabove our required regulatory minimum plus buffers which increased by basis points to at the start of the fourth quarter as our new stress capital buffer took effect as a reminder our gsib surcharge will not increase in while we have not repurchased any common stock since the first quarter of we currently expect to resume share repurchases in the first quarter this year turning to credit quality on slide credit performance remained strong with basis points of net chargeoffs in the fourth quarter however as expected losses are slowly increasing from historical lows and we expect them to continue to return toward prepandemic levels over time as the federal reserve continues to take actions to combat high inflation credit performance remained strong across our commercial businesses with only basis points of net chargeoffs in the fourth quarter total consumer net chargeoffs increased million from the third quarter to basis points of average loans driven by an increase in net chargeoffs in the credit card portfolio but remain slightly below consumer net chargeoff levels in the fourth quarter of nonperforming assets increased from the third quarter as lower residential mortgage nonaccrual loans were more than offset by higher commercial real estate nonaccrual loans our allowance for credit losses increased million in the fourth quarter primarily reflecting loan growth as well as a less favorable economic environment we are closely monitoring our portfolio for potential risk and are continuing to take some targeted actions to further tighten underwriting standards let me highlight trends in two of our portfolios the size of our auto portfolio has declined for three consecutive quarters and balances were down at the end of compared to yearend meanwhile originations were down in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago which reflected credit tightening actions and continued price competition due to rising interest rates of note our new vehicle origination surpassed used vehicles in the fourth quarter reflecting a combination of credit tightening actions that weve implemented and the industry dynamic of higher new vehicle sales growth turning to the commercial real estate office portfolio the office market is showing signs of weakness due to weak demand driving higher vacancy rates and deteriorating operating performance as well as challenging economic and capital market conditions while we havent seen this translate to significant loss content yet we do expect to see stress over time and are proactively working with borrowers to manage our exposure and being disciplined in our underwriting standards with both outstanding balances and credits down compared to a year ago on slide we highlight loans and deposits average loans grew from a year ago and billion from third quarter periodend loans increased for the sixth consecutive quarter with growth across our commercial portfolios and higher consumer loans driven by credit card and residential loans partially offset by continued declines in our auto portfolio wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 ill highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing our operating segment results average loan yields increased basis points from a year ago and basis points from third quarter reflecting the higher rate environment average deposits declined from a year ago and from the third quarter compared with the third quarter we saw declines in each of our businesses lower consumer balances reflected customers continuing to reallocate cash and higheryielding alternatives particularly in wealth and investment management and continued consumer spending as expected our average deposit costs increased basis points from the third quarter to basis points driven by higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates average deposit costs were up basis points since the fourth quarter of while market rates have increased substantially more during that same time as rates continued to rise we would expect deposit betas to continue to increase and customer migration from loweryielding to higheryielding deposit products to continue turning to net interest income on slide fourth quarter net interest income was billion which was higher than a year ago as we continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates ill provide details in our expectations later on the call turning to expenses on slide the increase in noninterest expense from both a year ago and from the third quarter was driven by higher operating losses excluding operating losses other noninterest expense was flat from a year ago as higher severance expense was offset by lower revenuerelated compensation and continued progress on our efficiency initiatives our operating losses in the fourth quarter included accruals related to the december cfpb consent order as part of that settlement we agreed to one incremental remediation and one new remediation related to overdraft fees the accrual related to these two remediations was approximately million our operating losses in the fourth quarter also included accruals for other legal actions and reflecting these accruals our current estimate of the highend of the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of our accrual for legal actions as of december is approximately billion this is down approximately billion from september while we still have outstanding litigation to resolve this estimate would be the lowest level since the second quarter of though of course new matters will arise and existing matters will develop over time the estimate for december will be updated at the time of our 10k filing in february and may change while we acknowledge the elevated level of operating losses the past two quarters have been significant they are important steps in putting historical issues behind us as weve been able to absorb these costs while increasing our cet1 ratio as i highlighted earlier turning to our operating segments starting with consumer banking and lending on slide consumer and small business banking revenue increased from a year ago driven by the impact of higher interest rates depositrelated fees continued to decline as we completed the rollout of the overdraft fee reductions and new product enhancements that we announced early last year to help customers avoid overdraft fees a majority of the revenue impact of these changes was reflected in the fourth quarter run rate weve continued to focus on branch rationalization as digital adoption and usage among our customers has steadily increased in we reduced branches by and branch staffing levels by and we expect to continue to optimize our branches and staffing levels in response to changing customer needs while industry mortgage rates declined in the fourth quarter they were still up over basis points since the beginning of the year and weekly mortgage applications as measured by the mortgage bankers association wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 were at a 26year low at quarterend the economic incentive to refinance is extremely limited and refinance applications for the industry were down in december compared to a year ago reflecting these market conditions our home lending revenue declined from a year ago driven by lower mortgage originations and gain on sale margins as well as lower revenue from the resecuritization of loans purchased from securitization pools we expect the mortgage origination market will continue to be challenging and gain on sale margins were made under pressure until excess capacity in the industry has been removed as we announced this week we will be exiting our correspondent business which we expect to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter we dont expect this action to have a significant impact on our financial results credit card revenue was up from a year ago due to higher loan balances driven by higher pointofsale volume and new product launches auto revenue declined from a year ago driven by continued loan spread compression from rising rates and credit tightening actions in certain areas as well as lower loan balances personal lending was up from a year ago due to higher loan balances partially offset by lower spread compression while originations grew from a year ago driven by strong consumer demand and investments in the business we have remained disciplined in our underwriting turning to some key business drivers on slide mortgage originations declined from a year ago and from the third quarter with both declines in correspondent and retail originations refinances as a percentage of total originations were over half of our volume a year ago but declined to in the fourth quarter of i already highlighted the drivers of the decline in auto originations so turning to debit card spending was up compared to a year ago holiday spend for debit card was flat compared to the season with lower transaction volume offset by higher average ticket size entertainment was the only category with doubledigit spending while categories such as home improvement general retail goods and fuel were all down compared to credit card spending increased from a year ago and while the yearoveryear growth rates slowed from the third quarter almost all categories continued to have doubledigit growth average balances were up from a year ago payment rates have started to moderate but were still well above prepandemic levels turning to commercial banking results on slide middle market banking revenue increased from a year ago driven by higher net interest income due to the impact of higher rates and higher loan balances assetbased lending and leasing revenue declined from a year ago driven by lower net gains from equity securities partially offset by loan growth average loan balances were up in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago while growth in the first half of was driven by higher line utilization utilization rates stabilized in the second half of the year average loan balances have grown for six consecutive quarters and were up in the third quarter with growth in assetbased lending and leasing driven by continued growth in client inventory which are still below prepandemic levels growth in middle market banking was driven by larger clients including both new and existing relationships which more than offset declines from our smaller customers turning to corporate and investment banking on slide banking revenue increased from year ago driven by stronger treasury management results due to the impact of higher interest rates as well as improved lending results investment banking fees declined from a year ago reflecting lower market activity with declines across all products and industries commercial real estate revenue grew from a year ago driven by stronger lending results due to higher balances and the impact of higher interest rates markets revenues increased from a year ago driven by higher trading revenue in equities rates and commodities foreign exchange and municipal products average loans grew from a year ago after growing for seven consecutive quarter average loans declined from the third quarter as utilization rates stabilized across most portfolios wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 on slide wealth and investment management revenue was up compared to a year ago as the increase in net interest income driven by the impact of higher rates was partially offset by lower assetbased fees due to the decrease in market valuations the majority of wim advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter so assetbased fees should increase slightly in the first quarter reflecting the higher market valuations at the end of the year expenses decreased from a year ago driven by lower revenuerelated compensation and the impact of efficiency initiatives even as loan growth and securitiesbased lending moderated due to demand caused by market volatility and the interest rate environment average loans grew from a yearago slide highlights our corporate results both revenue and expenses were impacted by the divestitures last year of our corporate trust business and wells fargo asset management we sold these businesses in the fourth quarter of which resulted in a net gain of million revenue also declined from a year ago due to low results in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses including the impairments of equity securities i highlighted earlier the increase in expenses from a year ago is driven by higher operating losses turning to our expectations for starting on slide let me start by highlighting our expectations for net interest income we are assuming the asset cap will remain in place throughout the year moving from left to right on the waterfall based on the current forward rate curve we expect our interest income will continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates even with deposits repricing faster than they did in however this benefit is expected to be partially offset by continued deposit runoff and mix shift to higheryielding products with these declines partially offset by modest loan growth we also expect a headwind from lower cib markets net interest income due to higher funding costs this reduction is expected to be partially offset by an increase in training gains and noninterest income so the impact to revenue is currently expected to be small putting this all together we currently expect net interest income to grow by approximately in versus ultimately the amount of net interest income we earn in will depend on a variety of factors many of which are uncertain including the absolute level of interest rates the shape of the yield curve deposit balances mix and pricing and the loan demand turning to our expense outlook on slide following the waterfall from left to right we reported billion of noninterest expense in which included billion of operating losses excluding operating losses expenses would have been billion which was in line with the guidance we provided at the beginning of last year if you also exclude operating losses from the guidance our expenses were impacted by inflation and higher severance expense however revenuerelated expenses were lower than expected by market conditions so we believe a good starting point for discussion of expenses is billion which excludes operating losses we expect expenses in to increase by approximately billion due to both merit increases including inflationary pressures and an approximately million increase in fdic expense related to the previously announced surcharge these increases are expected to be partially offset by approximately million of lower revenuerelated expense primarily driven by decreases in home lending based on current market levels we expect revenue related expense in wealth and investment management for to be similar to we successfully delivered on our commitment of approximately billion of gross expense saves over the past two years and through our efficiency initiatives we expect to realize an additional billion of gross expense reductions in a piece of this is related to the announcement we made earlier this week to create a more wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 focused home lending business but expense savings from reducing our servicing business will take more time to be realized we highlight on the slide the largest opportunities for additional savings this year and believe well have more opportunities beyond similar to prior years the resources needed to address our risk and control were separate from our efficiency initiatives and we will continue to add resources as necessary to complete this important work and while we continue to focus on executing our efficiency initiatives were also continuing to invest and expect approximately billion of incremental investments in our businesses in as charlie discussed investing in our businesses is critical to our ability to track growth across the company and better serve our customers but well also continue to be thoughtful and evaluate the level of investments throughout the year so putting this all together expenses excluding operating losses are expected to be relatively flat in compared with even with inflationary pressures a higher fdi surcharge and increase in the incremental investments in our businesses as demonstrated operating losses can be significant and hard to predict and therefore we have not included them in our expense outlook for however we currently anticipate ongoing businessrelated operating losses such as fraud theft and other business as usual losses to be approximately billion this year which is the same assumption we provided last year as previously disclosed we have outstanding litigation regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact the amount of operating losses its important to note that while we made substantial progress executing on our efficiency initiatives we still have a significant opportunity to get more efficient across the company this remains a multiyear process with the goal of achieving an efficiency ratio along with our peers based on our business mix given how critical continuing to invest into our story on slide we provided details on our primary areas of focus for as weve highlighted continuing to build the right risk and control of infrastructure remains our top priority and we will continue to invest in this important work charlie discussed many of the investments weve started to make in digital and payments we plan to continue to invest in these areas this year to make improvements for both our consumer and commercial customers we also plan to continue to invest to expand our client coverage in investment banking commercial banking wealth and investment management and to continue to transform our technology platforms including moving more applications to the cloud consolidating our data centers and increasing investments in cyber finally by investing in our operations and branches we expect not only to improve the customer experience but also improve efficiency reduce operational risk and drive account growth as we show on slide in the fourth quarter we reported an rotce but as i highlighted at the start of the call our fourth quarter results were impacted by several notable items including higher operating losses elevated impairments of equity securities severance and discrete tax benefits as we show on this slide if you exclude these notable items our fourth quarter rotce would have been approximately however we dont believe this accurately reflects our longerterm expectations for the following reasons net interest income was higher than our longterm expectations due to interest rates funding balances mix and pricing also net loan chargeoffs were at historically low levels if rates funding balances mix and pricing were closer to our longterm expectations and chargeoffs were higher our rotce would be lower depending on what adjustments you make here we may all get to a slightly different wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 answer so to be clear because the interest rates are higher and credit costs are lower than our longterm expectations we believe we have more work to do to improve our returns on slide we highlight our path to higher returns since we first discussed our rotce goals in the earnings call for the fourth quarter of we have executed a number of important items we executed on billion of gross common stock repurchases billion when you net issuances including our 401k plan we increased our common stock dividend from to per share we delivered approximately billion of gross expense saves and reduced head count by since the end of so weve made good progress over the past two years on things we can control and we believe we have a clear line of sight to a sustainable rotce of approximately in the medium term in order to achieve that we need to continue to optimize our capital including returning capital to shareholders and redeploying capital to higher returning products and businesses adding more focus in our home lending business should also be a positive contributor to higher returns we also have additional opportunities to execute on efficiency initiatives additionally we expect to benefit from the investments we are planning in our businesses which i highlighted earlier while some of these investments will be dependent on the market environment we expect them to increase rotce at the same time we will continue to prioritize building our risk and control infrastructure in the longer term we believe that running a company in a more controlled and disciplined manner will continue to benefit returns and our goal is for our four operating segments to produce returns comparable to our best peers in summary although the high level of operating losses we had in the fourth quarter significantly impacted our results the underlying results in the quarter continued to reflect an improvement in our earnings capacity as we look forward we expect to continue to grow net interest income and our expenses excluding operating losses are expected to be relatively flat even after inflation and incremental investments in our businesses drive growth both our credit performance and capital levels remain strong in the fourth quarter and we expect to resume share repurchases in the first quarter we will now take your questions wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 question and answer section operator thank you at this time we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question of today will come from ken usdin of jefferies your line is open sir ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi good morning good afternoon i should say mike just a followup on the nii outlook for the year so you obviously had a good high end to the year at billion fte and just looking at what the guide implies implies a stepdown a little bit of a stepdown from thereafter can you just kind of walk us through just how you expect the betas to move through and then like what doesnt necessarily follow through from here in terms of some of the moving parts thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah sure ken thanks for the question ill just kind of walk you through some of the drivers there and then obviously also the timing of when we expect to realize some of those matters as well and so as you look at the key things you look at indiscernible loan growth weve got were expecting kind of low to midsingle digit loan growth throughout the year so not superfast pace but sort of moderate pace of loan growth we are expecting some moderate declines across the deposit base stabilizing later in the year but some moderate declines as we look over the next few quarters and then we would expect the betas to continue to move up a little from here and then when you think about the pacing of it the first half of the year will certainly be higher than the second half of the year if all of these things play out and so you shouldnt expect a really big stepdown in the first quarter for sure and then i think that provides the opportunity potentially in the second half of the year if things if we dont see that stepdown in deposits or the betas are a little bit better than what we expected and then id just point out even as we looked at the fourth quarter the betas were a little bit better than what we had modeled and so were all in a little bit of uncharted territory here but i do think that theres some opportunity potentially in the second half of the year as we look at the forecast but itll be dependent upon how we fare over the next quarter or two ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and so second question heard your commentary about the billion of op losses and the fact that the rpls down to way down to billion just how do you kind of help us understand your range of confidence obviously last year op losses ended at billion as you made progress so how wide is the range of expectations around your confidence on that level of op loss for the year michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well i think if you look at what weve said over the last quarter or two theres been roughly in the third and fourth quarter ph million million of just bau op losses thats happened just fraud theft normal stuff that you should expect to continue so that gives you sort of a bottom end and then i think the rest of it is wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 will be a little dependent upon how we work through the rest of the issues that weve got to work through for next year but i think as you look at the rpl going from billion to billion as those big items have moved to be more probable and estimable for us we booked them and hopefully that gives you confidence that were putting some of the big things behind us but we still have stuff to work through and therell be more over time im sure but weve put a lot of big things behind us ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great thanks mike operator thank you the next question will come from scott siefers of piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co afternoon guys thank you for taking the question i think maybe a question along the same line there so the tone around the regulatory issues certainly sounds better than like days ago and that reasonably possible losses seems to give better quantitative thinking as well but what maybe charlie what are the major touch points sort of on your plate right now i know all roads ultimately lead to lifting the asset cap but maybe would be curious to hear your thoughts on just sort of the biggest things left in your mind charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yes well let me just so listen we still have a series of consent orders of which and i always point this out the asset cap is a piece of one of them so all roads dont lead to the asset cap the roads in this respect lead to us building the proper control environment which will satisfy ultimately all the consent orders and ive tried to be clear that we are making progress on that work it is a lot to do and our tone hasnt changed relative to the confidence in the progress that were making there so were going to continue doing it and hopefully its done to the satisfaction of the regulators but theyll have to decide that and as we continue to check off the todos on that work the control environment gets better and better and we become a betterrun company that doesnt have those kinds of operating losses that youve all seen in the past r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect thank you and then mike when you talk about resuming share repurchases in the first quarter maybe could you give us sort of a sense for order of magnitude and maybe just at an even higher level sort of how you get comfortable repurchasing in the face of what seems sort of still uncertain rules out there michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well i would start with where our cet1 ratio is at the end of the year were at so were well above our current regulatory minimum and the buffers that are included there so we have plenty of flexibility regardless of any outcome that comes out of the new rules that will be proposed and keep in mind thatll take some time to come out and get implemented and phased in and so theres its not going to happen in a day wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 and i think well go back to what weve been saying the last number of quarters as we think about the buffer that will put on the reg minimum of buffers of well be managing somewhere in the plus or minus a little basispoint range and depending on what happens with loan growth and rwa growth that we see over the quarter thatll help guide the share repurchases r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good thank you guys very much operator the next question comes from john mcdonald of autonomous research your line is open john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hey mike wanted to clarify your answer to ken about the first quarter nii i think you said you do not expect a big stepdown in the first quarter and maybe you could just frame first quarter nii a little bit for us relative to the billion what are some of the headwinds tailwinds and what might you expect at this point michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah no thanks john well first you have to normalize for a couple less days in the quarter so thats going to be a stepdown of call it million to million stepdown just there from less days and then as you look it should be relatively stable to the fourth quarter but there could be some a little bit of wiggle room in there john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research stable minus including the day count or michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co minus you got to take the day count adjust for the day count john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research and then audio gap charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co after reducing for the day count michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 okay got it and then charlie maybe a bigger question just kind of where are you on the efficiency journey when we think about billion of core expense for this year and the timeframe for rotce what will it take is there an efficiency ratio we should keep in mind or is that too hard to forecast maybe a little bit on that would be helpful charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co look its a good question i think so first of all i think when just make a just a couple of comments around the expense guidance we gave embedded in that expense guidance were still continuing to reduce the core expenses of the company but as you can see on that slide were anticipating that we will spend more money on investments that are around technology digital building out products and things like that that offset that to some extent to get to an overall flat expense base mike did say in his comments and i just want to repeat it that were not going to spend this money at all costs were going to see how the year continues to pan out its money that we would like to spend were planning to spend it but theres a lot of discretion in the expense base so we think its prudent as we sit here today to plan to spend it but were going to constantly be looking at our performance and make judgments on what that should be and so as we look at the efficiency of the company we do expect to continue to get efficiency ratio improvement in the place and if we dont see revenue growth and if we dont see payoffs from the things that were doing then we will spend less money and so thats the way were approaching it were either going to get the efficiency ratio to continue to improve because were getting real payoff on some things or we will reduce on a net basis but overall theres still gross expenses that should come out of the company which gives us the latitude to continue to grow the investments inside the company and the timing to get to listen its a great question as weve talked about it its medium term which is obviously not long term or short term but i would say and its without putting a specific timeframe it is it should be something that we have in our sights as we look out over the future its not something thats theoretical its something that we believe we should get to and just the problem and were just trying to stay a little bit away from quantifying exactly where were starting from just because everyone will make their own adjustments and its just i think what were just trying to do is be really clear that we dont want to take credit for the outperformance in nii we dont want to take credit for the outperformance in chargeoffs and that we still have to continue to drive improved performance each and every year at the company john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it thank you operator thank you the next question comes from steven chubak of wolfe research your line is open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good afternoon so charlie i was hoping to ask a followup to that last line of questioning around expenses you indicated that the expense work its going to continue beyond and the one metric that weve been tracking is head count and in terms of the benchmarking analysis that weve done head count is down more than since the peak or roughly but its still elevated versus your money center peers was hoping wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 you could just speak to what inning youre in currently in terms of optimizing head count and whether as we look beyond whether there is a credible path to actually driving investments lower you had talked about balancing investment with the need to drive those efficiency gains i just want to think about the expense trajectory beyond whether further reductions are achievable given some of that inflated head count still charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah listen i think i mean i think your point on head count versus peers is one that weve made and so yes we are all different in terms of the businesses that were in and what we do but we do and some insource and some outsourcing things but when you look at it we still have higher head count and higher expenses than people who are more complex than us some of that is explained by the work that were doing the expenses and heads that are building out the control infrastructure but theres a lot more beyond that thats the work that were doing to peel that back piece by piece by piece we still have a huge amount of manual processes inside the company we have duplicate systems and thats the work that were on so when i say that we still have gross expenses to be reduced in the company thats exactly what were talking about the question is when we get to a net basis where does that come out as i said before i think thats a decision that we want to be able to make at each and every point in time when we look at what the overall performance of the company is so again i just want to repeat what i said were not going to spend under any environment at all costs thats not the way were thinking about it if we dont see net improvements in performance of the company weve got the ability to ration back the discretionary spend so that we do continue to see improved performance of the company what wed like to see is that these things are paying off were seeing real sustainable revenue growth based upon these things and the ability to invest and so thats just kind of how thats the framework that were using to make the decisions and as we get to each point in time and its not even just an annual decision i mean mike and i and the operating committee have these discussions regularly about how are things panning out what does it look like and how do we feel about our willingness to continue to invest in these things and have it its got to be living and breathing steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats helpful color charlie and for my followup just also as it relates to the discussion around the buyback you guys are uniquely positioned in that you arent migrating into a higher gsib bucket because of the asset cap youre not going to necessarily see quite as much expansion in terms of balance sheet and youve conveyed a high level of confidence around the rotce where your stock is trading today at least on price of tangible reflects a pretty healthy degree of skepticism in your ability to get there just given the strength of your capital position why not get a bit more aggressive with the buyback here just recognizing the significant amount of capital youll generate some of the concerns around aoci seem to be abating would be helpful to get some perspective as to whether you might be willing to step it up meaningfully closer to 100type payout here charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co well so it just it sounds like youre drawing conclusions to the pace at which we said were going to buy stock back which i dont think weve actually said but what weve said is is that we havent been buying stock back we anticipate were going to begin buying it back as we think about how much we have available in that capacity what mike said was our cet1 went up to our required minimums plus buffers are at and we had wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 said that well manage basis points above the plus or minus so we do have substantial capacity plus the ongoing earnings capacity of the company and so that is thats our framework is to target a reasonable cet1 ratio if in the future we have to raise the levels of capital because of basel iii endgame or whatnot weve got earnings capacity to be able to do that but we do have the flexibility and now that weve got resolution with cfpb and things like that and be able to go buy stock back and well be making that decision based upon our views on the value of the stock and liquidity in the market and things like that but as we said we do anticipate well be back in i suppose to where weve been steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc fair enough more of my effort to assess the cadence and the magnitude but it sounds like you guys are quite comfortable leaning in here so thanks for taking my questions charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure operator thank you the next question comes from john pancari of evercore isi your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good afternoon wondering if you could just give a little bit more color on the net interest income side maybe if you can talk a little bit more about the noninterestbearing deposit mix shift that you think could continue here it looks like that could be a pretty material offset to your interest rate benefits so just want to see if you can perhaps talk about that and then maybe also help quantify the runoff that you expect to continue on the deposit side in terms of balances overall thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah john its mike i think overall as i said earlier we do expect some moderate decline in balances and some more mix shift changes as we go throughout the year and so you should expect that to continue and its all the stuff that should be expected as were in this environment and thats what were seeing and if you look at each of the businesses were seeing it kind of most acutely happen in the wealth business as people move into cash alternatives out of deposits and thats whats happening in a lot of wealth management businesses these days is people move that cash around and then across the rest of the consumer businesses its part people looking for higher yields but its also part people spending more and so youre seeing some of that decline come down as overall balances continue to decline as the stimulus has worn off and people continue to be out there spending so its a little bit of a number of drivers there and i think as i said earlier as you think about the nii pacing for this year this first half of the year will certainly be higher than the second half of the year given the trends that we expect to happen and if those are a little bit better than what were modeling then i think that provides some opportunity as we look at the second half of the year wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay mike thank you thats helpful and then separately you gave some pretty good color obviously around nii expectations now and then also on expenses on the fee side can you perhaps give us your expectation there around overall growth that you expect in noninterest income and maybe some of the major drivers of where you see growth and if you could possibly size it up perhaps around the investment banking area et cetera that would help thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah sure and so as you break apart fees the biggest line item there is the investment advisory fees and thats going to be somewhat dependent upon where the market goes so if we start to see recovery in the equity markets at a more substantial pace thatll obviously be a big benefit for that business when you look at some of the other line items deposit fees as i mentioned in my commentary most of the decline that we were expecting to see as a result of the overdraft policy changes and new products that we implemented is in the run rate you may see some pressure there related to earnings credits on the commercial side but the run rate decline for overdrafts is really in there when you think about investment banking fees thats going to be somewhat market dependent weve seen its too early to know how thats going to shape up in terms of the overall industry volume there but as we continue to make the investments in our investment banking business over a longer period of time we would expect to see some growth there both in how we go after that opportunity in the commercial bank and middle market space as well as our other large corporate clients there and so a lot of thats going to be dependent on the market but were confident that were going to be positioning ourselves better and better to take advantage of it and then we talked about mortgage mortgage is a small piece of the is a much smaller piece of the puzzle than it was today so we dont expect that to be charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co smaller piece today than it was historically michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co sorry yeah smaller piece today than it was historically and so and thats going to be a pretty challenging market until in this rate environment so i think we were confident in the investments were making that will pay off over time but it may take a little time to start to see some of that come through depending on the market dynamics john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it all right thanks mike appreciate the color operator the next question comes from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america your line is open wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good afternoon i just had one question i guess charlie in your opening remarks you mentioned that the impact on customers from higher rates i think you implied was not getting worse with the incremental rates was that the right takeaway and if so and if the fed ere to stop after another hike do you actually see that the impact to your customers may not be as meaningful as feared over the last to months and implications of that on the credit quality and the credit performance of your book would love to hear any perspective you can share charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure what i was trying to say in those remarks was the impact on rising rates is continuing to impact customers on a periodoverperiod basis and we would expect that to continue but its not accelerating its much more linear than exponential and the fact that its much more linear is actually a very helpful thing because that gives people that just thats a more orderly transition to a slower growth economy and gives consumers a chance it shows that theyre adjusting their spending patterns and savings patterns and borrowing patterns to adjust for the reality of higher rates and on your second question we would anticipate that we would continue to see deterioration in those metrics continue after the fed stops raising rates for a period just because of the amount of time that it takes those things to filter through the economy more broadly so hopefully that was helpful ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and just a quick followup i think you mentioned earlier around commercial real estate like are you seeing any stress theres some discussion around the ability of these loans to get refied given the movein rates weve seen over the last year any stress within the cre book and anything just in terms of home indiscernible a lot of negative headlines indiscernible would love to hear your perspective on that too michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co hey its mike ill try to take that and charlie can add if he needs when you look at the and youre really getting at the office i think space more than anything there theres certainly more stress in the office space than there was a quarter or two or three quarters ago and i think youre seeing that now it hasnt translated into lost content at this point and so were keeping a careful eye on it and i think it is as you look at where you see it most it is in older lowerclass properties and over of our portfolio is in class a space and so we feel like the quality of its pretty good but we will see some stress as we go through here so far its been pretty idiosyncratic in terms of individual buildings and individual places but we are very watchful on cities like san francisco like los angeles like washington dc where youre seeing lease rates overall be much lower than other cities across the country and so certainly those are markets that were keeping a pretty close eye on and making sure were being proactive with our borrowers to make sure were thinking way ahead of any maturities or extensions options that need to get put in place to help manage through it wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator the next question comes from erika najarian of ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good afternoon just one more clarification question if i may on net interest income mike your underlying assumptions to your nii outlook in terms of lowtomidsingledigit loan growth moderate declines in deposit balances in the first half and stabilizing that doesnt feel very different from what consensus had been assuming to get to billion for which is clearly higher than whats implied by your outlook so im wondering if i could reask kens question what deposit betas what terminal deposit betas what range of expectations are you baking into that billion forecast and did you bake a significant amount of conservatism as you think about your nii outlook and im asking that question because one of your peer ceos said their billion outlook was not conservative so i think that given the outlook versus consensus expectations i did have to reask that question here michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah no look its charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah lets start with the second before mike actually goes ph with the facts again i think one of the things that youre hearing from all of us that were all very consistent on which i know you appreciate but i just want to say it anyway is we dont know what the rate path is going to look like from here over the next months which is exactly what youre asking and exactly what the competitive environment is going to be month by month versus all of the people we compete with so youre looking at we dont know what the alternatives going to be in nonbank deposits and we dont know what the alternatives are going to be in bank deposits but were trying to make those predictions so i think when we go through all of this were all just trying to in our own way make sure that theres clarity that were all and ill speak for myself now were trying to give you what we think is achievable and in our case based upon the rate curve that weve laid out in the document and it might or might not turn out that way were also assuming and ive talked about this at a conference in december that we are going to continue to raise rates in which we pay our consumers because were thinking about this not in terms of maximizing short term nii but thinking about it in terms of the value of the relationship and making sure that we pay properly for that so that were continuing to recognize how expensive it is to get a new relationship and how profitable it can be to keep an existing relationship and so if your views are different towards the end of the year as to what the rate scenario could be thats fine specifically what weve tried to do as weve gotten closer to the periods with which we see is give you some wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 clarity as mike did on what were the first quarter is a little clearer to us but beyond that is pretty difficult and were not going to go through every last beta that were assuming in terms of what those forecasts are michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah and the only thing ill add to it is when the fed does ultimately peak in terms of rising rates you will see a lag on pricing as that will pricing will continue to increase over a quarter or two quarters three quarters really it all depends on the competitive environment so youre going to have some lag there but im sure all of us have our own points of view and assumptions underneath those models but what were trying to give you as charlie said is a case that we think is achievable through the year and as i said earlier on the call i think if weve depending on how it plays out over the first and second quarter we could have some opportunity in the second half but i think its unclear exactly how thatll play out so well obviously keep you updated as it goes erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co thanks erika operator thank you the next question is from betsy graseck of morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good afternoon charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i did want to just unpack a couple of things around the correspondent exit and also some followup questions as it relates to the mortgage business in general there i think you mentioned that its not substantial impact maybe you could help us understand revenues expenses eps i made my own assumptions but i get a lot of questions from people on what management say so would like to understand that piece of it and then could you help us understand how youre thinking about the mortgage business once you exit correspondent is there any originate and sell servicing retained left in any panel or are you saying with this correspondent exit that youll be moving entirely to portfolioing for yourself and the msr will wind down over time just give us some color around that would be appreciated thanks charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah so ill start on the second and then mike can circle around to the first wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 so no we are not assuming that we will balance sheet every loan that we underwrite in the future again what were trying to do in the path that weve laid forward is just to make very clear that were not interested in running and having a business which is focused on a standalone mortgage product we very much appreciate the importance of mortgage to the consumer base and were going to continue to stay in the business but were going to view it as part of the importance in the broader relationship so that means well be originating both conforming and nonconforming mortgages and well continue to make the decision as to what goes on our balance sheet as we have done in the past the fact that well be originating a lot less will certainly mean that over time the msr and the overall servicing book will come down very naturally based upon that over a fairly long period of time but well also look for intelligent and economic ways to reduce the complexity and the size of our servicing book between now and then and if those present themselves well certainly be interested in doing that and i know mike will talk a little bit about this but i think one of the things we were just trying to say when we think about the size of the impact of exiting the correspondent business immediately is given the fact that mortgage volumes are so low and revenues are so low the revenue impact of exiting the correspondent business in the short term is not meaningful its a very small number of people so thats not all that meaningful in the short term the real benefit comes over time as we reduce the size of the servicing business which as weve tried to make the point is its not just reducing expenses but its not profitable for us today in a whole bunch of these segments where we continue to have the servicing and so it becomes a positive over time and its just but that is not a shortterm benefit for us but certainly a medium to longerterm one michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah and the only thing id add is all you lose initially betsy is the gain on sale on the origination the servicing is still here and that in any given quarter over the last couple years is low tens of millions of dollars so its a really small impact betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc the servicing cost is low tens of millions charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co no michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co no the gain the only thing you lose today by exiting correspondent is the gain on sale on the origination of the mortgage betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc oh the low tens of millions is the gain on sale wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co correct betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah okay im sorry michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co the servicing of the existing portfolio is still here and charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co it is part of the broader servicing dialogue betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so is it because one of the followups i got was does it impact the scale obviously it reduces the flow over existing plant so does that matter to how you indiscernible betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah i mean charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co no its not even close i mean the amount that were originating today relative to the scale we have in the business its immaterial and even as weve downsized the portfolio on the servicing side the whole point of our servicing portfolio can be substantially substantially lower and will still have scale to be able to originate the product and we would say in a more profitable way than were doing it today betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and so the remaining mortgage origination channels are retail is that right charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yes betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay right because youre out of wholesale youre out of correspondent wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yes thats correct betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right thank you charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co okay operator the next question comes from vivek juneja of jpmorgan your line is open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for taking my questions a question for you would the cfpb settlement there was a comment by the head of cfpb about growth initiatives of slowing your progress so charlie my question to you is what are you planning to do in regards to that comment in terms of the growth initiatives are you trying to slow anything any color on that charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah i addressed it in my remarks which is weve been very very clear and i think if you look back on every earnings call let alone any time i speak publicly were very consistent in making sure that everyone understands both internally and externally that our number one priority is getting that work done that is how were running the company we have very clear processes internally to make sure that that happens and were very confident thats the case and the things that we are doing to grow the business we think are actually helpful to actually making it a more controlled place and were going to continue to go forward the same way weve been going forward being very conscious of making sure things dont get in the way vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks a completely different question on in the past youve given some color on deposits amongst different tiers of customers any color any update on where those stand currently and your outlook on that charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co its still very much the same which is that kind of intuitive that those who went in with lower balances are the ones who are living more paychecktopaycheck and they are seeing more stress than those that have not had that but i would say its the rate of change its still the same across most of the affluent spectrum so the trends are still very consistent vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 thanks operator and our final question for today will come from gerard cassidy of rbc your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets thank you good afternoon charlie indiscernible to flip this question from your answers to the servicing and the residential mortgage business are there any lines of businesses that i know you cant go out and make an acquisition of course but any lines of business as youre looking to grow and enhance and beef up maybe through hiring groups of people to do that strategic increase charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co listen i think when we look at all of it i mean ive said this in the past when we look at each of these businesses that we have and that can be consumer bank its consumer lending wealth commercial and the corporate investment bank with the exception of the home lending business and the rest of the consumer lending businesses that lend its all going to be based upon returns and what were seeing in terms of market competitiveness all of these businesses have the opportunity to continue to grow share and when we think about the things that were doing to invest we are targeting investment banking ads in both coverage and products were focused in commercial banking on the buildout of both the corporate investment offerings for that customer base both the corporate investment bank and the commercial bank have opportunities to continue to improve what we do from the treasury services perspective and so we see growth opportunities there ive talked about the opportunities in our wonderful wealth management business to bring on some more investment teams as weve reoriented that business and when we wind up looking in the consumer lending side youve seen growth in the credit card side of the business which we would expect to continue and our consumer bank as we very carefully evolve from fixing the problems that weve had taking advantage of the franchise so when we talk about and we had this page in the deck page in the earnings presentation we do see multiple places for us to be able to increase the rate of growth by just organically which sometimes involves adding people sometimes its building technology sometimes its just improved execution and there are other things like affluence whatnot that i havent mentioned but there are a bunch and theyre pretty broad gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets great and then just as a quick followup mike you guys mentioned that there was a private equity or equity writedown in the quarter can you share with us how big that was and then just i know over the years you guys have done very well in this area but and then second how big is the portfolio whats remaining there michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co sure theres about billion writedown million after noncontrolling interest and so thats on the first page of the release if you want to refer back it was primarily driven by some writedowns in enterprise software companies and in particular it was really one investment that drove most of it and i would just point out we had a that investment is still a very good investment the companys a good investment and were still holding it wellabove where the invested amount is wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13jan2023 charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co just to be clear were holding it at something like still michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co a little under billion charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah i would say times what we invested in it michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co but like all enterprise software companies the company its just the rate of growth over the next year or so has come down substantially but its still a very highquality company michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co and then just more broadly on the venture business weve done the teams done a great job over a very long period of time and we still think its a very good business operator and that was our final question michael p santomassimo senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co okay thank you all and we appreciate the time and well talk to you next quarter charles william scharf president chief executive officer director wells fargo co take care everyone byebye operator thank you all for your participation on todays
