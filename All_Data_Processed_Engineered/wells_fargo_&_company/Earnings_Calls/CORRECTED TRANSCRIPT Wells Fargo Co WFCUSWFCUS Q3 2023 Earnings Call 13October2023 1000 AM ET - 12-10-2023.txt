officer director wells fargo co thanks very much john ill make some brief comments about our third quarter results and update you on our priorities ill then turn the call over to mike to review third quarter results in more detail before we take your questions let me start with some third quarter highlights our results reflected progress were making to improve our financial performance revenue pretax provision profit net income dilutive earnings per common share and rotce were all higher than a year ago our revenue reflected strong net interest income growth as well as higher noninterest income as we benefited from higher rates and the investments were making in our businesses our expenses declined from a year ago due to lower operating losses as expected net chargeoffs have continued to increase from historical low levels and we increased our allowance for credit losses primarily driven by our office portfolio as well as growth in our credit card portfolio average commercial and consumer loans were both down from the second quarter as higher rates and a slowing economy have weakened loan demand and weve continued to take some credit tightening actions average deposits also declined from the second quarter and a year ago driven by the consumer spending as well as customers migrating to higher yielding alternatives consumer spending remains strong with third quarter year overyear growth rates for both credit and debit card spending increasing from the second quarter now let me update you on the progress were making on our strategic priorities starting with risk and control work which remains our top priority as time goes on we continue to make the progress necessary to complete our work ive said that we have detailed project plans which track interim deliverables not just the dates the work is to be finalized and turned over to the regulators for validation the work is not finalized all at once its not as if theres a bigbang conversion at the conclusion of a big body of work its just the opposite building our risk and control framework is a continuous ongoing effort we are implementing changes throughout the life of the project and we track effectiveness along the way in numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly improving our control environment but we will not be satisfied until all of our work is complete we remain focused on the work ahead even as we are making progress but i will repeat what i said in the past regulatory pressure on banks with longstanding issues such as ours continues to grow and until we complete our work and until it is validated by our regulators we remain at risk of further regulatory actions additionally until our work is complete we could find new issues that needs to be remediated and these may result in additional regulatory actions we also continue to take steps to advance our business strategy which includes focusing on our core business and customers we sold approximately billion of private equity investments in certain norwest equity partners and norwest mezzanine partners funds we are also making a number of investments to better serve our customers as a leader in us middle market and assetbased lending were focused on finding ways to support our clients with the recently announced strategic relationship with centerbridge partners our middle market clients will have greater access to alternative sources of capital that can be used to pursue a broader set of growth and value creation initiatives across a variety of market conditions wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 branches continue to play an important role in the way we serve our customers and we continue to optimize our network but we also look at targeted expansions in markets where we see opportunities for our franchise last week we announced were expanding our branch network in chicago where we only have seven branches today we also continue to make enhancements to our mobile app and in the third quarter we launched stock fractions giving wellstrade clients the ability to buy fractions of companies stocks to help build a diversified portfolio regardless of stock price just yesterday we announced the expanded availability of lifesync to all consumer customers available on the mobile app lifesync is our personized digital approach to aligning customers goals with their money and was launched to all wealth and investment management clients earlier this year customers goals entered in lifesync will be visible to bankers to enhance needsbased conversations we also expanded the capabilities of fargo our aipowered virtual assistant and recently added the ability for customers to communicate with fargo in spanish these enhanced capabilities are just the latest of our ongoing investments to deliver seamless and consistent experiences across all our channels we are seeing more mobile adoption momentum adding over mobile active users in the third quarter our best quarterly growth since first quarter of weve also continued to make important hires to bring expertise to wells fargo in businesses were looking to grow before i highlight some of our new leaders id like to take this opportunity to thank bill daley vice chairman of public affairs who is retiring at the end of this year for all hes accomplished since he joined the company in bill has been an invaluable asset to the company and we benefited from his long experience in both the public and private sectors during his time at wells fargo he helped strengthen our relationships with communities we serve established new programs in housing and small business and worked to rebuild our reputation both locally and nationally im pleased to have announced that thomas nides joined wells fargo as vice chairman earlier this month tom will be a close advisor to the senior management team on a range of issues and he will work alongside our business leaders as we continue to expand our relationships with clients the breadth of toms experience across the public and private sectors will be an important asset to us as we continue to move the company ahead we continue to invest in our corporate and investment banking business with new coheads of equity capital markets these new hires complement the other important hires weve been making over the past year we also hired a new head of trust services and chief fiduciary officer in our wealth and investment management segment and a new head of affluent and premier banking in consumer small and business banking we also continued to focus on better serving our communities during the third quarter we published three reports that provided overview of the work we are doing to build a sustainable inclusive future in the communities we serve outline our strategic approach to managing risks associated with climate change and deploying capital to support a transition to a lowcarbon economy and describe our methodology for aligning our financial portfolios with pathways to netzero greenhouse gas emissions by and for setting interim emissionsbased targets to track that alignment we continue to make progress on our special purpose credit program initiative we announced last year to help drive economic growth sustainable homeownership and neighborhood stability in minority communities we recently expanded our special purpose refinance offers to prequalified hispanic customers with wells fargo mortgages to refinance at a lowerthanmarket rate the program launched last year for black or african wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 american customers has seen strong results and the hispanic offer has shown similar levels of customer engagement we also announced that were offering a homebuyer access grant that will be applied towards down payment for eligible homebuyers who currently live in who are purchasing homes in certain underserved communities in eight metropolitan areas and we now have hope inside centers in wells fargo branches including the first focusing on serving the navajo community the centers help engage and empower communities to achieve their financial goals through financial education workshops and free oneonone coaching looking ahead the us economy has continued to be resilient with key support from the labor market and strength in consumer spending delinquencies have continued to deteriorate at a relatively slow consistent rate without signs of acceleration across our portfolios our base case remains a continued slowing of the economy but we remain prepared for a wide range of scenarios given theres still significant uncertainty ahead regarding capital the basel iii endgame proposal included higher capital requirements as we expected its a complicated set of rules but at this point if nothing changed and we didnt take actions we estimate that our rwa would increase by approximately there are some items that increased our capital requirements that we were hopeful will be adjusted and we will be participating and sharing our perspectives on the proposed rules during the 120day comment period additionally we are evaluating changes we may make based on the proposed rules fortunately weve come into this from a strong position as our current capital levels are above the estimated regulatory minimum plus buffers however we still need to decide how much of an additional buffer we want to maintain and what mitigating actions we may want to take to reduce the impact of the new rules at this point we still see a path to concurrently increasing our level of cet1 as appropriate increasing our dividend and repurchasing common stock levels of each will be influenced by ccar finalization of the proposed rules and economic conditions ill now turn the call over to mike michael p santomassimo senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thank you charlie and good morning everyone net income for the third quarter was billion or per diluted common share both up from the second quarter and a year ago our third quarter results included million or per share of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of priorperiod tax matters turning to capital and liquidity on slide our cet1 ratio increased to in the third quarter percentage points above our new regulatory minimum plus buffers effective on october this was up from in the second quarter as higher earnings the approximately 14basispoint benefit from the sale of certain private equity investments and lower riskweighted assets were only partially offset by share repurchases and dividends during the third quarter we repurchased billion in common stock our strong capital levels position us well for the anticipated increases related to the basel iii endgame proposal released in the third quarter based on where we ended the quarter we estimate that our cet1 ratio would be basis points above the fully phasedin required minimum if the proposed rules were implemented as written after factoring the growth in rwas and the resulting decline in our stress capital buffer as well as the impact of the new gsib buffer calculation changes wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 importantly this is an early estimate subject to change and is before any actions we may take to mitigate the impact of the new rules looking forward we expect to continue to have capacity to increase our cet1 ratio while we plan to continue to repurchase shares as we wait for the capital rules to be finalized turning to credit quality on slide as we expected net loan chargeoffs continued to increase up basis points from the second quarter to basis points of average loans commercial net loan chargeoffs declined modestly from the second quarter to basis points of average loans as lower losses in our commercial and industrial portfolio were partially offset by million of higher losses in commercial real estate we had billion of office loans down from the second quarter which represented of our total loans outstanding vacancy rates continue to be high and the office market remains weak our cre teams continue to focus on monitoring and derisking the portfolio which includes reducing exposures as we highlighted in the past each property situation is different and there remain variables that could determine performance which is why we regularly review this portfolio as expected consumer net loan chargeoffs continued to increase and were up million from the second quarter to basis points of average loans residential mortgage loans continued to have net recoveries while our other consumer portfolios all had higher losses with the largest increase in our auto portfolio which was up from the second quarter seasonal lows nonperforming assets increased from the second quarter as growth in commercial real estate nonaccrual loans more than offset the decline in commercial and industrial as well as modest declines across all consumer portfolios the decline in commercial and industrial nonaccrual loans was primarily due to payoffs and paydowns which is a good reminder that the resolution of nonperforming assets doesnt always result in chargeoffs the increase in commercial real estate nonaccrual loans was driven by a billion increase in the office nonaccrual loans moving to slide our allowance for credit losses increased million in the third quarter primarily for commercial real estate office loans as well as for higher credit card loan balances which was partially offset by lower allowance for auto loans since the composition of our office portfolio is relatively consistent with what we shared with you in the past few quarters we did not include a separate commercial real estate slide this quarter however we did update the table showing the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for commercial real estate including the breakdown of the office portfolio we have not seen significant increases in chargeoffs in our commercial real estate office portfolio yet however we do expect higher losses over time and we continued to increase the coverage ratio in our cib commercial real estate office portfolio from at the end of the second quarter to at the end of the third quarter on slide we highlight loans and deposits average loans were down modestly from both the second quarter and a year ago while we continue to have good growth in credit card loans from the second quarter most other portfolios declined ill highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results average loan yields increased basis points from a year ago and basis points from the second quarter due to the higher interest rate environment average deposits declined from a year ago predominantly driven by deposit outflows in our consumer and wealth businesses reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higheryielding wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 alternatives average deposits also declined in commercial banking while they stabilized in corporate and investment banking as expected our average deposit costs continued to increase up basis points from the second quarter to basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates however the pace of the increase has slowed and our percentage of average noninterestbearing deposits decreased modestly from the second quarter to but remained above prepandemic levels turning to net interest income on slide third quarter net interest income was billion up from year ago as we continued to benefit from the impact of higher rates the million decline from the second quarter was due to lower average deposit balances partially offset by one additional day in the quarter and the impact of higher interest rates last quarter we increased our expectations for full year net interest income growth to approximately compared with which was up from our expectation of growth at the beginning of the year we now expect full year net interest income growth to grow by approximately compared with with the fourth quarter net interest income expected to be approximately billion the expected decline in net interest income in the fourth quarter is primarily driven by our assumption for additional deposit outflows and migration from noninterestbearing to interestbearing deposits as well as continued deposit repricing including continued competitive pricing on commercial deposits turning to expenses on slide noninterest expense declined from a year ago driven by lower operating losses and increased from the second quarter driven by higher operating losses severance expense and revenue related comp last quarter we updated our expectation for full year noninterest expense excluding operating losses to approximately billion we now expect it to be approximately billion or approximately billion in the fourth quarter the increase reflects additional severance and other onetime costs revenuerelated compensation and some lags in realizing efficiency saves weve reduced head count every quarter since the third quarter of and it was down in second quarter and from a year ago we believe we still have additional opportunities to reduce head count and attrition has remained low which will likely result in additional severance expense for actions in we are working through our efficiency plans now as part of the budget process additionally if the fdic deposit special assessment related to the events from earlier in the year is finalized in the fourth quarter it would increase our expected fourth quarter expenses and finally as a reminder we had outstanding litigation regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating results turning to our operating segments starting with consumer banking and lending on slide consumer small and business banking revenue increased from a year ago as higher net interest income driven by the impact of higher interest rates was partially offset by lower depositrelated fees driven by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out last year charlie highlighted the investments were making in our chicago branch network and were also making investments in refurbishing branches across our existing network additionally we are bringing our digital onboarding experience to our branches creating a fast and easy experience for customers at the same time weve reduced our total number of branches by from year ago home lending revenue declined from a year ago due to a decline in mortgage banking income driven by lower originations and servicing income which included the impact of sales of mortgage servicing rights we wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 continue to reduce head count in home lending in the third quarter down from a year ago and we expect staffing levels will continue to decline credit card revenue increased from a year ago due to higher loan balances partially offset by introductory promotional rates and higher credit card rewards expense payment rates have been relatively stable over the past year and remain above prepandemic levels new account growth continued to be strong up from a year ago reflecting the continuing success of our new products and increased marketing importantly the quality of the new accounts continued to be better than what we were booking historically while the majority of new cards were to existing wells fargo customers were increasingly attracting more customers that are new to wells fargo auto revenue declined from a year ago driven by continued loan spread compression and lower loan balances personal lending revenue is up from a year ago due to higher loan balances turning to some key business drivers on slide mortgage originations declined from the year ago and in the second quarter we continue to make progress on the strategic plans we announced earlier this year including focusing on serving wells fargo bank customers as well as borrowers in minority communities we did not originate or fund any correspondent mortgages in the third quarter the size of our auto portfolios declined for six consecutive quarters and balances were down at the end of the third quarter compared to a year ago origination volume declined from a year ago reflecting credit tightening actions as well as continued price competition our origination mix continued to shift towards higher fico scores reflecting in credittightening actions weve taken over the past year debit card spending increased from a year ago with growth in most categories offsetting declines in fuel home improvement and travel credit card spending continued to be strong and was up from the year ago all categories grew from a year ago including fuel which rebounded after declining in the second quarter turning to commercial banking results on slide middle market banking revenue increased from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances assetbased lending and leasing revenue increased yearoveryear due to higher loan balances as well as higher revenue from renewable energy investments average loan balances were up in the third quarter compared to a year ago driven by growth in assetbased lending and leasing average loans were down from the second quarter due to declines in middle market banking after increase in the first half of the year revolver utilization rates declined in the third quarter to levels similar to a year ago turning to corporate and investment banking on slide banking revenue increased from year ago driven by higher lending revenue stronger treasury management results reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and higher investment banking revenue reflecting increased activity across all products as charlie highlighted we continued to hire experienced bankers helping us deliver for our clients and positioning us well when markets improve commercial real estate revenue grew from a year ago reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and higher revenue in our lowincome housing business partially offset by lower loan and deposit balances markets revenue increased from a year ago driven by higher revenue in structured products equities credit products and foreign exchange wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 weve had strong trading results for three consecutive quarters as we benefited from market volatility and the investments weve made in technology and talent to grow this business average loans were down from the year ago driven by banking reflecting a combination of slower demand payoffs and modestly lower line utilization average loan balances were stable with the second quarter on slide wealth and investment management revenue increased compared to a year ago driven by higher assetbased fees due to the increased market valuations net interest income declined from a year ago driven by lower deposit balances as customers continued to reallocate cash into higher yielding alternatives as well as lower loan balances while average deposits were down compared with both the second quarter and a year ago the pace of the decline slowed in the third quarter as a reminder the majority of wealth and investment management advisory assets were priced at the beginning of the quarter so third quarter results reflected market valuations as of july which were higher from a year ago assetbased fees in the fourth quarter will reflect market valuations as of october which were also higher from a year ago but were lower from the third quarter pricing date average loans were down from a year ago primarily due to a decline in securitiesbased lending slide highlights our corporate results this segment includes venture capital and private equity investments including the investments in funds that we sold in the third quarter the sale had a nominal impact on third quarter net income revenue declined million from the year ago reflecting assumption changes related to the valuation of our b2b common stock exposure as well as lower venture capital revenue in summary our results in the third quarter reflect a continued improvement in our financial performance during the first nine months of this year we had strong growth in revenue pretax provision profit and diluted earnings per share compared to a year ago as expected our net chargeoffs have continued to slowly increase from historical lows and we increased our allowance for credit losses by over billion this year primarily for cre office loans and higher credit card loan balances we are closely monitoring our portfolios and taking credittightening actions where we believe appropriate our capital levels have increased and we expect to continue to return excess capital to shareholders we will now take your questions wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and we will take our first question from john mcdonald of autonomous research your line is open sir john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp hi good morning i wanted to ask about the expenses mike obviously improving efficiency has been a big goal of yours you made progress even while investing in regulatory what are the additional opportunities to improve efficiency from here as you head into i know youre probably not ready to give a guidance for yet but are you going into the budget planning with a mindset that they should be roughly flattish and any comments you can give on that would be helpful thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah sure thanks john first up lets just make sure we keep it all in context right we set out a program almost three years ago now to cut roughly billion and i think thats all still on track weve brought head count down from or closer to from the peak back in so sort of very good progress to date and i think as charlie and i have both said over the last couple quarters we still have more to do to make it more efficient and i would say there are very few parts of the company that we would say are optimized at this point now some have more opportunity than others some require investment in terms of automation and technology some dont but i do think that we go into the budget process and even just how we operate every quarter with a very disciplined approach to every single area of the company saying what are we going to do to continue to drive more efficiency there while we make investments as well and we highlighted some of those that weve been making on in the prepared remarks but i think its the same mindset weve been bringing to it now for the last few years and i think were going to continue to do that where that ultimately ends up well share for next year well share with you in january like we always do john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp okay fair enough and then on the net interest income outlook for the fourth quarter are you building in assumptions you mentioned deposit outflows and mix shift assumptions are they assuming that things accelerate from here or are similar to what youve seen this quarter it seems like a pretty big sequential decline just kind of wondering what some of the assumptions are there thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah no look i think as weve talked about over the last it feels like forever but certainly the last four five six quarters now theres still a lot of uncertainty out there in terms of how the path of both deposits and pricing will shape up whether its all the quantitative tightening all of the any competitive reactions we may see from others and so i think we continue to think that were going to see these trends appear at some point wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 now weve been pleasantly surprised todate this year that it hasnt progressed as fast as we thought it would but at some point it will and so hopefully well find ourselves in a position where it doesnt move as maybe fast as weve modeled in terms of pricing but we still all those trends are going to happen and are happening as you look at shifts between noninterestbearing and interestbearing youre seeing deposit costs continue to increase and on the consumer side you see people spending their money and so exactly at what pace those things are all going to keep going is we certainly modeled it but we try to give you a base case forecast that we can hit under a bunch of different scenarios and this is the same john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp okay got it thank you operator the next question will come from steven chubak of wolfe research your line is open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hey steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so wanted to start charlie because you had made some comments about capital targets and those potentially evolving the inflation rwa from basel iii endgame that you guided to does bring your cet1 minimum to you alluded subtly mind you to the possibility of managing to a lower target since bps management cushion does feel excessive what are some of the factors that would compel you to maintain a larger cushion than peers and maybe continue to run at or above charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co well let me just ill start and then ill hand it over to mike i was not trying to give any direction about where we thought the appropriate buffer would be were just trying to be very factual about where we are and once everything is finalized well determine what the right buffers are and well communicate those so please dont try and read any more into what i said other than just that michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah and i think steve i know your estimate might be basis points but i think what weve talked about over time is that at least at this point weve been saying our buffers probably closer to basis points over wherever the right minimum might be and that may evolve as charlie said i think as you look at basel iii the increase in rwas is driven by the things that are probably pretty obvious whether its operational risk plus some of the other factors but operational risk is certainly going to be one of the bigger pieces of it and so i really do think that we have to see how the final rule shakes out next year wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 were hopeful that therell be some changes to areas that we think just makes sense from aligning sort of the capital requirements to the risk while also maybe moderating some of the operational risk increases as well and so were going to engage as we go there but one of the factors that weve talked about now for a while in terms of how big our buffer should be is is that we needed the rules to be finalized and so could that lead you to having a slightly smaller buffer than what we would have had in the past potentially but i think we have to get there and get these finalized and then well also take actions once we have good clarity on whats going to change or not change as we go over the next year so i mean were probably months to months away from getting a final rule and so we still have a little bit of time for this to play out steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for the color and mike for followup just on the trading business it continues to surprise positively versus expectations you cited some of the investments that youve made the benefits of volatility but with revenues running multiples above what weve seen in prior years and that billionplus bogey being reached for three consecutive quarters was hoping you could just speak to whether we should be underwriting billionplus as a new normal or if there were any cyclical benefits or anomalous benefits that maybe we shouldnt be underwriting go forward just trying to think about what the normalized level of trading revenue should be given some of the investments youve made scaling of that business michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah ill take that look i think weve as we said weve just been methodically investing in the capabilities with a focus on supporting our core clients more than with more capabilities versus like trying to expand the scope of what we do in a way that just doesnt fit who we are and so i think thats what youve seen us try to do there in those businesses so businesses like fx and rates and just its sort of methodically sort of adding people in a couple slots or improving technology and weve certainly been the benefit of some volatility in the market this year so as you know that could change pretty quickly one way or the other but i think as we look at some of these businesses what were focused on is just adding more clients more flows more incrementally each month and each quarter and so whether it ends up being billion plus or minus per quarter i think well see as we go but were pretty pleased with what weve seen so far and there isnt a big onetime event that happened in the quarter that drove the results and so thats good to see as well and youre also not seeing big growth in market risk rwa as we do this as well and so thats part of what weve been trying to do as well is kind of sweat the balance sheet more and make sure that were getting paid for the exposure and the risk weve got there and so were happy to see that its starting to come together and were under no illusions though that three quarters is like a success right weve got to do this over a long period of time and continue to add capabilities and clients steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great operator the next question will come from scott siefers of piper sandler your line is open wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hi all thanks for taking the question i was hoping maybe mike you could spend another moment sort of discussing rwa mitigation in light of the fed capital proposal and i guess specifically i was hoping for maybe a little more color i know you touched on it in some of the earlier remarks but the sale of the billion in private equity and then maybe if you could also discuss the newer agreement with centerbridge for direct lending just sort of how all these factor into your thinking here michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co sure when you look at mitigation yeah ill just give you some examples of the types of things were thinking about so when you look at security finance transactions you have collateral haircut floors that get implemented and i dont want to get too technical on it but theres some technical requirements there that just dont seem to make sense to us but if they do get implemented as written well adapt and well change the way weve what collateral we require from clients to do trades or well reprice them and so therell be a number of things that we can do like on transactions like that that it gets very very technical for each of the underlying deals i know others have talked about this too well have to decide how much tax equity investing we do in renewables if the risk weights hold there just the math just doesnt make sense from a return perspective and so well probably have to do less well probably do less of those and so theres a number of things like that as you go through each of the underlying portfolios just dont make sense and well make the adjustments as we need to now were also in a position where weve got plenty of flexibility as we talked about in the prepared remarks right our capital levels today are there with a buffer already and so we have the flexibility to handle it however we think makes sense for each of the underlying businesses and what we want to make sure we do is like were building real businesses and client relationships over a long period of time so its not about necessarily walking away from clients its about finding ways to serve them in ways that both make sense for them and from a return perspective for us but its going to be a very very granular conversation some of it will be repricing you got 364day revolvers that will need to be repriced theres a whole bunch of very technical things like that that will get done over time once the rules finalize switching to the partnership we have with centerbridge look we have been getting demand from clients for a while now in the middle market kind of midcorporate space for solutions to help them in financing that they need where it likely wouldnt make sense for us to put on our balance sheet anyway and so instead of telling clients we cant help them or having them go direct to somebody else we built the partnership with centerbridge that allows us to remain an advisor to a client and help them solve a problem they may have and so thats the way were thinking about it and were excited to work with centerbridge and that team and theyre a very highquality team have done a lot over time and i think this gives us another arrow in the quiver to help us provide solutions for clients and so its early and itll grow over time hopefully and hopefully clients will see it in the same way r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 okay perfect thank you and then maybe as a followup you might want to revisit something to revisit the nii discussion for a bit certainly appreciate all the comments on continued mix shift and deposit pricing pressure but i guess as we get to this level at the end of the year is the thought that there would still be on balance downward pressure on nii beyond there or as you see it is there enough kind of asset repricing opportunity that would ultimately allow things to settle out maybe sooner as opposed to later michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah i mean well see i think we do need to wait until we get towards the end of the year and into january for us to give you a real view on i mean i think look the last number of quarters just show over and over and over that theres a lot still to play out here and to get too far ahead of ourselves on it for next year i think would be a mistake at this point but look its the same drivers weve been talking about for a while right its like whats going to happen with deposits the mix the pricing and then to a lesser degree right now its loan growth but it still matters over a long period of time as well r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay perfect thank you very much operator the next question comes from matthew oconnor of deutsche bank your line is open sir matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning can you just elaborate on the comment of tightening the credit box a bit and then i guess specifically in credit card thoughts there i know youve been leaning into it and its had real good growth and i think its still only about of your loan book but wondering your thoughts of is this really the right time to be leaning into credit card maybe elsewhere kind of later cycle michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah ill start with credit card and come back to the broader point so we started on a journey to transform the card business back in the fourth quarter of so right after really charlie started and what weve done since then is really refreshed almost completely refreshed the product line we still have a little bit more to do there and so part of what youre seeing come through in the results is actually putting out good products that people want to buy and youre seeing we had really good new account growth in the quarter probably our best quarter in quite some time and so it starts with just having a good product and good service behind it and thats the key driver i think of what youre seeing here on the credit side on the new originations the new accounts were adding are really good relative to the back book and when you look at both and even when you dig a little bit deeper there the majority of them are still wells fargo bank customers but were seeing more and more traction with nonwells fargo customers so first time customers and when you look at those firsttime to wells customers the credit profile is really good and so we feel comfortable with like the risks thats being added there and were going to continue to look for pockets of risk and if we see them well tighten it down but in terms of what were seeing in originations we feel good about what were seeing so far wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 just more broadly on credit weve said now for probably the last four or five quarters weve been kind of incrementally tightening the credit box on the consumer side for a while whether its really across the board in home lending auto card personal loans really every single one of them had some credit tightening and its been a bit incremental over the last four or five quarters and so i would still sort of think of that as like taking that last or or of origination out that doesnt make sense in what could be a more difficult economic environment its not wholesale shifts in sort of the approach or the underlying box that were operating in its really sort of modest and incremental and then on the charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co and just to be clear i mean its and its the very basic stuff its just upping the lower fico boundaries its layered risks and so its just as you continue to make these changes were just continuing to do the same types of things without just wholesale exits or anything like that its just kind of the smart tightening michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah and then outside of consumer really the only place that weve meaningfully tightened credit over the last couple of years or few years is commercial real estate and other than that i think there is probably some minor tinkering but we havent really changed the appetite much outside of commercial real estate matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then just clarification on the severance costs can you give us what the absolute amount was this quarter i think you give us the change versus a year ago and linked quarter but what was the absolute level this quarter michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah there wasnt a lot a year ago so its not far off of the total so small difference but there wasnt a lot matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay so about million michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah and again thatll sort of evolve as we go i mentioned that in my script as we look at next year and the attrition rates that were seeing matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yes okay thank you operator the next question will come from john pancari of evercore isi wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning on the commercial real estate front i know you cited the increase in the office loan loss reserve and the cib from to can you just comment there in terms of what were some of the anecdotal drivers for the loan loss reserve increase do you think you could have incremental increases here and maybe cite some of the office revaluations youve seen as you have indiscernible the underlying collateral change hands or reappraisals if you can give us some color there as well thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah sure the hard part of office right now is that there arent a lot of trades happening yet right theres a few in certain cities and theyre all a little bit different in their complexion so you still have somewhat limited information and price discovery in a lot of places and so we do a lot of our own work to try to evaluate each of the underlying properties and what they could be worth in a bunch of different scenarios and then its feeling like the appraisal market is starting to kind of catch up where were seeing appraisals that are more realistic and more updated so thats certainly bringing in different data points as we look at it and as we look at the quarter we sort of look at all those data points and the underlying loans and try to do our best to come up with what we think the different range of loss could look like here and thats whats embedded in the results hopefully we end up being conservative but nonetheless its possible that this plays out this way and so we havent really seen any losses of significance yet but we will and it just takes some time for it to play out for each of these underlying situations probably longer than any of us would hope youd hope that you could bring some of this stuff to resolution maybe faster than it really takes in real life but its really looking at all the data points the limited sales the new appraisals are coming through and then our own analysis for each of the underlying properties john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks mike and then separately but also within commercial real estate were getting more and more questions around multifamily exposures and just how well they really are holding up given some supply issues in certain markets can you just comment there are you seeing any noteworthy stress or any changes to underlying reserve for that book michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah not a lot i mean you certainly see certain markets that might appear to have some oversupply in condos in certain places but it feels like that will work itself out over a period of time were not seeing real systematic stress in the portfolio at this point john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it and if i can ask just one last one on the head count cuts that you mentioned youre looking at every business pretty much are any head count cuts occurring yet in the risk area or anything or any changes with the contracts with the consultants in the risk overhaul area at all thanks wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah no look the only thing id say on the risk and reg work is that were going to spend whatever we need to spend and put the resources we need against it to get it done and were going to continue to do that until indiscernible charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah and just to be clear like were not cutting head count related to that in fact its probably the opposite when you look over the past bunch of quarters the only thing which goes up and down is depending on where we are with work with outside consultants that number will go up or down in a given quarter but weve also said if we can use outside resources to help get the work done sooner were going to so as we think about our efficiencies that is just not in scope at this point or for the foreseeable future john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks charlie charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co sure of course operator the next question comes from erika najarian of ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning my first question is on the revenue side as a followup to chubaks line of questioning i think not only the trading numbers come better this year but also investment banking and so hear you loud and clear about the cyclicality of the trading business but i guess help us get a sense of if the industry wallet for example returned to levels do you think that youre going to have a generally higher share of revenues in capital markets versus and sort of the subquestion to that is as we think about the investments you have already made what are the other businesses that could potentially surprise us to the upside where its not quite optimized yet in terms of its revenue production and obviously everybodys thinking about youve mentioned card and also everybodys also thinking about wealth management and investment advisory revenues charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah well let me take a shot at that listen i think the answer is to your question on share without getting overly specific yes we think when you look at where we stand on our growth in our corporate and investment banking share whether its on the trading side or whether its on the feerelated side our shares have grown and certainly within the feebased side of the business we do hope they continue to grow thats driven by the investments that were making and investments meaning people in terms of growing our capabilities and weve wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 got clear goals and targets by person that we bring on in terms of what we expect and were going to be tracking to that just a reminder certainly when we brought some of the people on they bring a lot of clients with them some do transactions in the short term and weve been beneficiaries of that over the last couple of quarters just as we brought some people on but these are relationshipbased businesses and transactions dont occur every single quarter so we would expect our share to continue to grow and as a reminder without taking any additional risk overall because were taking the risk today relative to the exposures that we have when we look at where we can see growth coming overall across the entire company we just go business by business absolutely in our consumer small and business banking segment because weve basically been treading water there as we stabilize that business going back to the issues that we had there which was an incredibly difficult thing to do and we did and weve not been on our front foot in that business were going to do it very different way than this company did it historically but there are opportunities to be on the front foot and actually grow share on an organic basis and so incredibly excited of that opportunity not excited as i said about growing share in mortgage thats not where we are after and weve talked about where were going there auto its about returns not growth so dont look for a lot of growth there unless the dynamics change in the business mike spoke about card were incredibly energized by the evidence that shows with our brand and our relationships when you put a great product out there we get positive selection and real growth and by the way look at our spend numbers i mean you want to see like the impact of what it means just look at the spend that were seeing which is much higher than the industry levels our wealth business as you pointed out no question also treaded water for a long period of time were attracting people and teams were rolling out new products so we feel really good about the opportunities that are there and in the middle market segment where its a little bit more business as usual because it is such a strong franchise for us even there we look back at our assetbased lending businesses and the things that we acquired from ge they ran as standalone businesses here for a long period of time and we didnt bring the entire product set of wells fargo to those customer bases under kyle hranicky kristin lesher and mary katherine dubose are diligently working through that and bringing the investment banking product to the the entire commercial banking product so i mean i could go on it should be broad based most of it by the way ill point out in terms of when we see opportunities it is feebased growth not because weve dictated that but just because we focused a lot on nii as a company historically and we just have a lot of opportunities that we get excited about thatll play out over a period of time erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and i think that excitement is clear charlie and my second question is given all of that and taking a step back i totally think its too early i agree with you to give anything on expenses but more broadly discussing do you feel like the company is in a little bit of an inflection point because on one hand mike was saying that very few parts of the bank are optimized on the other i think you guys mentioned that the head counts not going the other way and perhaps its really some of the outside consulting fees that could go up and down but im wondering if you get asked about wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 expenses in a framework of flat but then all of this momentum on the revenue side seems to be ph under comm im wondering how you think about as you budget for the company and as you think about just getting to that rotce lets just put basel iii endgame aside in terms of the denominator how do you balance some of the shareholders and the analysts that are asking you about expenses in the context of flat versus the revenue momentum that obviously would need expenses to keep sustaining what is that revenue momentum that you seem to be so excited about charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co let me start and mike you either come in at the end or just make your comments along the way as well so i think first of all we think about it as two separate exercises that we go through and its very timely because were in the middle of going through the exercise for next year as most other companies are which is this company is not efficient like period end of story and ive described this even with all of the reductions that weve made its not surprising because as you peel the onion back other things present themselves and so just you go in order of things that are more obvious and things like that but when we sit around as a management team we feel great about the progress and theres no clearer way to see that than in the head count numbers which ultimately drive the expense of the company and if we stood here and told you we were going to drive the head count down that much in this period of time im not sure you wouldve believed us and so when we say were going to do something we really do mean it and so when we sit around with the team there are many more efficiencies to get and were diligently working through those and then separately from that its when we talk about making investments in the place are we getting the payoff for it and so whether its the marketing in the card business where were spending more money on marketing than we had in the past and we feel great about as mike pointed out not just the volumes that were getting but the underlying quality relative to how we had modeled that and so well do that with each and every thing and ultimately we need to make a decision as we finalize the process of the budget on just much more of a tactical basis of how those things net out were well aware of what shareholders are looking for were well aware that the expense side of this company is an important equation in what investors look at us in terms of where unlocking value and we hear it and we see it and wherever we come out when we talk to you about our guidance for next year we will explain why we got to where we are its going to include efficiencies its going to include investments where that turns out well explain it and i think so far weve been as clear and as transparent as we can be and if it makes sense youll like it and if it doesnt youll tell us but so far weve been able to have alignment there but overall its a long way of saying its not lost on us that we have opportunities both to reduce expenses and to invest but making sure that the overall expense level stays in check at this place is incredibly important to us and we have to prove that theres revenue growth there supporting investments that we make erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you for that wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 operator the next question will come from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hey good morning just mike for you a followup on credit on the ci side nonaccrual chargeoffs staying relatively flat i guess as we look through just talk to us in terms of when you look at that ci book is the impact of the fed rate hikes felt by your customers and how are you seeing that evolve is your expectation right now you talked about the economy being resilient are you seeing any soft spots on the ci book where youre seeing bankruptcies rise within a vertical or a certain segment michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah no look i think first youre seeing it come through in utilization of revolvers which are pretty much in check that arent moving much and down in some cases so people are building less inventory given where rates are they may be making decision on like how fast they want to invest in their businesses and so youre seeing that come through in loan growth which is sensible from their perspective i think when you look across the portfolio there are certainly pockets where you may be seeing margin compression still or different idiosyncratic issues but across the portfolio the credit qualitys still good ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch and do you think your customers have felt the hit from higher rates already or is that on the come michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co i think they certainly felt it so far right i mean most of them have variable rate loans that they service right and obviously the longer rates stay high theyll maybe feel it more but certainly i think theyve been impacted ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and just one separate quick question on the outlook for buybacks clearly big reset lower when like you have excess capital you probably have visibility on the worst case on basel endgame its very rare that banks have excess capital when the stocks are actually near lows youre creating a tangible book how do you think about outside of ccar and scb in terms of nearterm pace of buybacks over the next few quarters relative to what we did this quarter wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah i mean were not going to get into like trying to give you a view on pacing we have a process we go through every quarter to look at all of whats happening first its like how are we going to support clients whats demand were seeing what kind of risks are out there in the fourth quarter we have the fdic special assessment potentially coming and so each quarter theres going to be a whole range of things that were going to go through and then well decide on pacing ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch okay thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from gerard cassidy of rbc your line is open sir gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning thank you mike can you share with us you and your peers as well as investors weve all been surprised with how this deposit trend of moving money into higheryielding deposits is going slower than expected is there any categories within your deposit base whether its just your regular consumer deposits or highnetworth deposits or the nonoperational commercial deposits that are moving more slowly and i know you said you expect it to happen but is there something that says it could pick up real quickly in the next six months or is it just a gradual increase michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah gerard i think you really have to pick it apart by the different businesses i think in the wealth business it moved quite quickly in terms of seeing deposits decline from where they were and that is now moderated so its good to see that that shifting has sort of slowed down quite substantially in the quarter relative to the last couple quarters on the consumer side the majority of the deposits that weve got sit in accounts with less than and so to some degree these are to a large degree these are operational accounts for folks and so theres some portion of those funds that are never going to move into other places because people need it in their accounts to live and operate every day and so i think whats so i think well see right and i think were all in a bit of uncharted territory at this point with rates being where they are and the pace at which they got there and quantitative tightening happening and so i think we need to be prepared for it to change exactly at what pace and over what period of time well see but we certainly havent seen deposit pricing move the way we modeled it a year ago for sure gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup since you and charlie have come on board wells has really done a very good job in returning that excess capital i understand everything thats going on today and you guys described it in your comments can you share with us is there a buffer whenever the final numbers come out are you guys planning to keep a 100basispoint buffer above that or any color there wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah we havent decided exactly what the buffer will look like after basel iii is implemented but so far what weve said a number of times is that basis points is about where weve been targeting obviously weve been running above that for a while but as we get a better view of where these rules are going to shake out well probably talk about that more but i would think that the basis points at least for now is sort of the bottom end of the range gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good much appreciated thank you operator and that was our final question for today i will now turn it over to your speakers for closing remarks charles william scharf
