make some brief comments about our third quarter results the operating environment and update you on our priorities ill then turn the call over to mike to review third quarter results in more detail before we take your questions let me start with the third quarter highlights our solid business performance this quarter was significantly impacted by billion or per share in operating losses related to litigation customer remediation and regulatory matters primarily related to a variety of historical matters as you know weve been and remain focused on increasing our earnings capacity and see the positive impact of rising interest rates driving strong net interest income growth and our continued focus on improving operating efficiencies resulting in lower expenses excluding operating losses credit quality remains strong and we continue to invest in our technology platforms digital capabilities and delivering additional products to our customers and clients while were closely monitoring trends with economic conditions expected to weaken given inflation geopolitical instability energy price volatility and rising interest rates our customers continue to be resilient with overall strong credit performance and solid cash flow when looking at simple averages across the entire consumer portfolio deposit balances per account decreased from the second quarter but were still higher than a year ago and remained above prepandemic levels wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 however we continue to closely monitor activity by segment for signs of potential stress and for certain cohorts of customers weve seen average balances steadily decline and are now below prepandemic levels and their debit card spend continues to decline this is a continuation of what i referenced last quarter but its important to note that this remains a small percentage of our total customer base overall our consumer deposit customers health indicators including cash flow payroll and overdraft trends are still not showing elevated risk concerns debit card spending remained significantly above prepandemic levels and was up in the third quarter compared to a year ago consistent with the second quarter increase entertainment and fuel spending had the largest increases from a year ago but the recent decline in fuel prices drove fuel spending to decline compared to the second quarter apparel and home improvement spending declined from both a year ago and second quarter credit card spend remained strong in the third quarter up from a year ago with doubledigit increases coming across all spending categories spending was up modestly on a linkedquarter basis so remember a significant portion of this growth was from our new products which continued to have strong credit profiles periodend commercial loan balances were stable compared to the second quarter with continued growth in commercial banking offset by declines across our businesses in corporate and investment banking credit performance remained strong with net chargeoffs and nonaccrual loans continuing to decline from exceptionally low levels clients do tell us that they continue to be impacted by persistent inflation rising interest rates and tight labor market and while credit quality remains strong were actively monitoring inflationsensitive industries and taking proactive actions where warranted now let me update you on the progress were making on our strategic priorities we continue to devote significant resources to implementing an appropriate risk and control framework across the company and this remains our top priority we continue to make progress and are executing on our plans but significant work remains as a reminder though im confident in our ability to complete the work it remains a significant body of work and the primary focus to the company we have set high standards for success and given the longstanding nature of much of our work we have said that we remain at risk of setbacks until it is complete expenses in the quarter reflect these ongoing risks and our efforts to resolve them as we continue our work to put our historical issues behind us and to address issues that are identified as we advance our risk control infrastructure work outstanding issues still remain that will likely result in additional expense in the coming quarters which could be significant we are working to close these as quickly as possible and we remain committed to doing right for our customers and working closely with our regulators and others to resolve these matters we recognize the importance of moving forward and the expenses in the quarter are representative of these efforts at the same time were implementing changes to better serve our customers and investing in our businesses to help drive growth as part of the announcement we made earlier this year to limit overdraftrelated fees and give customers more options to achieve their financial goals we implemented extra day grace period in the third quarter which provides consumer customers an extra business day ph to turn negative balances and avoid overdraft fees we also began to roll out early pay day which provides consumer customers who receive eligible direct deposits the ability to access funds up to two days earlier than scheduled further reducing the potential to incur overdrafts notably while this enhancement was rolled out in only six states in the third quarter during the first two weeks of offering this enhancement we provided customers early access to billion in funds from million eligible direct deposits and were on track for a fourth quarter rollout of an easytoaccess shortterm credit product that will give qualifying customers another option to meet their personal financial needs these actions build on wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 services that weve introduced over the past several years including offering an account that does not charge any overdraft fees we now have over million of those clear access banking accounts up from a year ago and as i mentioned last quarter we developed a new integrated banking lending and investment offering that is geared towards the more complex financial needs of our affluent clients called wells fargo premier during the quarter we introduced wells fargo premier across our entire branch footprint initiated a branded digital experience and launched marketing programs to help affluent customers learn more about how we can better serve them well continue to build the wells fargo premier offering in the coming quarters in the third quarter we continued to launch new apis providing our commercial and corporate clients more flexibility in helping them drive efficiencies for example we launched a new realtime payment api allowing clients to send a digital request to a payer that can be approved to easily send a realtime credit transfer we also launched a virtual card api which enables clients to create and configure virtual cards for b2b vendor payments and purchases in our cib markets businesses were accelerating our investment into our electronic trading capabilities across multiple asset classes to better meet the evolving needs of our clients which is helping to drive strong gains in trading volumes and were selectively adding talent in our investment banking coverage and product areas as we focus on leveraging our strong existing relationships to build our feebased businesses we also continue to make progress on the environmental social and governance work that is underway at wells fargo in the third quarter we published our latest esg report which highlights the progress we made in on our esg efforts we consider this work to sustain longterm commitment and believe wells fargo is well positioned to make a difference we issued our second sustainability bond in the amount of billion that will finance projects and programs supporting housing affordability economic opportunity renewable energy and clean transportation during the third quarter we officially launched a new grant program in houston san diego and milwaukee to help improve racial equity in homeownership and we have more markets coming before the end of this year this is part of the million commitment we made earlier this year through the wells fargo foundation to wealth opportunities restored through homeownership or work this effort aims to create homeowners of color across eight markets by the end of we announced the million donation to provide urgent relief to florida following the aftermath of hurricane ian in addition customer accommodations and employee support are available to those directly impacted by the storm in summary continued high inflation has kept the federal reserve aggressive with rate hikes leading the housing market to slow rapidly and the heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook and geopolitical events caused the financial market to be volatile however labor demand remains robust consumer balance sheets remain healthy and customers have capacity to borrow wells fargo is positioned well as we will continue to benefit from higher rates and ongoing disciplined expense management both consumer and business customers remain in a strong financial condition and we continue to see historically low delinquencies and high payment rates across our portfolios were closely monitoring risks related to the continued impact of high inflation and increasing rates as well as the broader geopolitical risks and we do expect to see increases in delinquencies and ultimately credit losses but the timing remains unclear as we look forward we remain bullish on our business opportunities and our higher operating margins and strong capital ratios have prepared us for wide range macroeconomic scenarios in the third quarter we increased our wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 common stock dividend by and our cet1 ratio was basis points above our current regulatory minimum including buffers we will continue to prudently manage our capital levels to be appropriately prepared for slowing economy and market volatility finally i know many of you were interested in our expectations and on our next earnings call we plan to provide our expense and net interest income outlook as well as more color on our path to over the cycle rotce i will now turn the call over to mike michael p santomassimo senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co thank you charlie and good morning everyone net income for the quarter was billion or per diluted common share as charlie highlighted our results included billion or per share of accruals primarily related to a variety of historical matters these accruals drove our total expenses higher however if you exclude operating losses our expenses would have declined as we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives revenue improved in the third quarter driven by higher net interest income while noninterest income also increased from the second quarter our effective income tax rate in the third quarter was we highlight capital on slide our cet1 ratio is down basis points from the second quarter as the basis point decline from aoci as well as the impact from dividend payments was nearly offset by our third quarter earnings our cet1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers which increased by basis points to at the start of the fourth quarter as our new stress capital buffer took effect as a reminder our gsib surcharge will not increase in we did not buy back any common stock in the second or third quarters and we will continue to be prudent regarding the amount and timing of any share repurchases turning to credit quality on slide credit performance remains strong with only basis points of net chargeoffs in the third quarter however as expected losses are slowly increasing from historical lows and we expect them to continue to normalize towards prepandemic levels over time as the federal reserve continues to take actions to combat inflation we are closely monitoring our portfolio for potential risks and are continuing to take some targeted actions to further tighten underwriting standards commercial credit performance remains strong across our commercial businesses with only million of net chargeoffs and net recoveries in our commercial real estate portfolio for the third consecutive quarter we also had net recoveries in our consumer real estate portfolios however total consumer net chargeoffs increased million from the second quarter to basis points on average loans driven by an increase in net chargeoffs in the auto portfolio higher loss rates on certain auto loans originated primarily in the latter part of contributed to the linkedquarter increase in chargeoffs and delinquent loans in the auto portfolio lower loan balances also impacted the loss rate we started taking credit tightening actions earlier this year which have improved the quality of originations as a result of these actions increased pricing competition and continued industry supply chain constraints the third quarter origination volumes were down over compared to a year ago nonperforming assets declined again in the third quarter and were down million or from the second quarter and down from a year ago while commercial nonaccruals continue to decline lower levels of wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 consumer nonaccruals were the primary driver of lower nonperforming assets due to a decrease in residential mortgage nonaccrual loans from the impact of customer sustained payment performance after exiting covid related accommodation programs our allowance for credit losses increased million in the third quarter primarily reflecting loan growth and a less favorable economic environment on slide we highlight loans and deposits average loans grew from a year ago and from the second quarter periodend loans increased for the fifth consecutive quarter but growth slowed as expected with commercial loan balances holding relatively stable from the second quarter while consumer loans grew driven by credit card and first lien residential mortgage loans partially offset by continued declines in our auto portfolio ill highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing our operating segment results average loan yields increased nearly basis points from a year ago and basis points from a second quarter reflecting the higher rate environment average deposits declined from both a year ago and the second quarter with declines across our deposit gathering businesses compared with the second quarter wealth and investment management had the largest decline by dollar amount as clients looked for higher yielding alternatives declines in our commercial businesses were driven mostly by outflows of nonoperational deposits which can be more pricesensitive and a less stable source of funding outflows in consumer and small business banking were driven by continued customer spending and increased outflows from customers seeking higher yielding products our average deposit cost increased basis points from the second quarter to basis points pricing has been consistent with our expectations with deposit costs holding relatively stable in consumer banking and lending while trending higher across other businesses as rates continue to rise we would expect deposit betas to continue to increase and customer migration from lower yielding to higher yielding deposit products to also increase turning to net interest income on slide third quarter net interest income increased billion or from a year ago and billion or from the second quarter the growth from the second quarter was primarily driven by the impact of higher rates which increased earning asset yields and reduced premium amortization from mortgagebacked securities we also benefited from higher loan balances and one additional day in the quarter these benefits were partially offset by higher funding costs in the first nine months of this year net interest income was up compared with a year ago we currently expect full year net interest income to be approximately higher than a year ago with fourth quarter net interest income expected to be approximately billion turning to expenses on slide the increase in noninterest expense from both a year ago and from the second quarter was due to the higher operating losses that i highlighted earlier excluding operating losses other noninterest expense was down from a year ago as we had lower revenue related compensation expenses related to divestitures came out of the run rate and we continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives excluding operating losses our expenses would have been down on a yearoveryear basis for six consecutive quarters another way you can see the impact of our efficiency initiatives is through lower head count which has declined for nine consecutive quarters and was down from a year ago weve also reduced professional and outside services expense by and occupancy expense by during the first nine months of this year the higher level of operating losses in the third quarter will cause us to exceed our billion expense outlook for wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 which included billion of operating losses for the full year we currently expect our fourth quarter other expenses excluding operating losses to be approximately billion as charlie highlighted outstanding litigation customer remediation and regulatory matters still remain that will still remain and will likely result in additional expense in the coming quarters which could be significant turning to our operating segments starting with consumer banking and lending on slide consumer and small business banking revenue increased from a year ago driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher deposit balances depositrelated fees were impacted by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out earlier this year which eliminated nonsufficient funds and some other fees the extra day grace period launched in the beginning of august and early pay day began in select states in september so we would expect our deposit related fees to decline further in the fourth quarter industry mortgage rates have increased over basis points since the beginning of the year and ended the quarter at the highest level since driving weekly mortgage applications as measured by the mortgage bankers association to a 25year low at quarterend as a result our home lending revenue declined from a year ago driven by lower mortgage originations and gain on sale margins as well as lower revenue from the resecuritization of loans purchased from securitization pools while the mortgage market adjusts the lower volumes we expect it to remain challenging in the near term and its possible that we have a further decline in the mortgage banking revenue in the fourth quarter when originations are seasonally slower we continue to remove excess capacity to align with the reduced demand and expect these adjustments will continue over the next couple of quarters credit card revenue was up from a year ago due to higher loan balance which benefited from higher point of sale volume and new product launches auto revenue declined from a year ago driven by loan spread compression and partially offset by higher loan balances and personal lending was from a year ago due to higher loan balances driven by growth in origination volumes turning to some key business drivers on slide mortgage originations declined from a year ago and from the second quarter with declines in both correspondent and retail originations refinances as a percentage of total originations declined to in the third quarter average home lending loan balances grew from the second quarter driven by growth in our nonconforming portfolio i already highlighted the drivers of decline in auto originations so turning to debit card while debit card spend increased from a year ago spending declined from the second quarter as charlie highlighted credit card point of sale purchase volumes were up from a year ago with the largest percentage increases in fuel and travel average balances were up from a year ago reflecting the strong point of sale volume which also benefited from the launch of new products with new accounts up we will continue to remain disciplined in our underwriting of new credit card accounts turning to commercial banking results on slide middle market banking revenue increased from a year ago driven by higher net interest income due to the impact of higher rates and higher loan balances assetbased lending and leasing revenue increased from a year ago driven by higher net gains from equity securities higher loan balances and higher revenue from renewable energy investments noninterest expense increased from a year ago primarily driven by higher operating costs and higher operating losses average loan balances have grown for five consecutive quarters and were up from a year ago line utilization rates were fairly stable relative to the second quarter inflation and our customers continued efforts to wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 rebuild inventory as supply chain challenges remain drove the growth in assetbased lending and leasing loan growth in the middle market banking continued to come from larger clients which more than offset declines from smaller clients turning to corporate and investment banking on slide banking revenue increased from a year ago driven by stronger treasury management results reflecting the impact of higher interest rates as well as higher loan balances investment banking fees declined from a year ago reflecting lower market activity compared with the second quarter the increase in investment banking fees was due to the writedown of unfunded leverage finance commitments last quarter commercial real estate revenue grew from a year ago driven by higher loan balances the impact of higher interest rates as well as improved commercial mortgagebacked securities gain on sale margins markets revenue increased from a year ago reflecting volatility and strong client demand in equities rates and commodities and foreign exchange trading average loans grew from a year ago with broadbased growth across our businesses to fund clients working capital needs but the pace of growth slowed in the third quarter with average balances up and periodend loans down from the second quarter on slide wealth and investment management revenue grew from a year ago as the increase to net interest income driven by the impact of higher rates offset the decline in assetbased fees driven by lower market valuations as a reminder the majority of wim advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter so third quarter results reflected the lower market valuations as of july and while the sp and fixed income indices declined again in the third quarter the decrease was not as steep as the second quarter decline so while there will be another stepdown in assetbased fees in the fourth quarter it will be less significant than the third quarter decline expenses decreased from a year ago due to lower revenuerelated compensation average loans increased from a year ago driven by continued momentum in securitiesbased lending slide highlights our corporate results both revenue and expenses were impacted by the divestitures last year of our corporate trust services business and wells fargo asset management these businesses contributed million of revenue and accounted for approximately million of expense in the third quarter of revenue also declined from a year ago due to lower equity gains in our affiliate venture capital private equity businesses and given current market conditions we dont expect equity gains to improve in the fourth quarter expenses increased from a year ago due to higher operating losses in summary although the high level of operating losses we had in the quarter significantly impacted our results the underlying results in the quarter continue to reflect our improving earnings capacity we had strong net interest income growth from rising rates and if you exclude operating losses our expenses would have declined as we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives both our credit performance and capital levels remain strong we will now take your questions wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions and our first question for today will come from john mcdonald of autonomous research your line is open sir john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research thank you good morning guys mike i wanted to ask on the expenses the first in terms of the operating losses i know its tough to answer but should we think of the op loss accrual this quarter as you reassessing what you might have to pay in the future or you got hit with some stuff that you didnt expect and youve already paid up is there some combination of those how should we think about what happened this quarter with the op loss accrual charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co hey john its charlie i guess the way we would describe it is i mean like i think you all know the accounting rules on when you accrue things are pretty clear based upon generally when you know something or have a pretty good sense that something is going to be done so its probable and you can put an estimate on it and so as weve said weve tried to be very very transparent that we do have things that will be lumpy that could be significant and its in our best interest to get as much behind us as quickly as we possibly can its what weve been trying to do both with our work but also the financial impact of these things and thats what youre seeing in the quarter john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then maybe mike i could follow up on the nonop expense outlook for billion in the fourth quarter implies up from the billion this quarter maybe just some context of whats driving that is it seasonality and then can we think of that jumping off point on the fourth quarter as the beginning of annualizing that for next year and what would be roughly the puts and takes were thinking about next year from the fourth quarter thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah no thanks john and i think when you think about the change from third quarter to fourth quarter it really is just some seasonal things and if you go back over a long period of time you just see yearend accruals related to a bunch of different items that sort of end up in the fourth quarter and so theres no story there other than that i think we continue to be on track on the efficiency work that we laid out at the beginning of the year and so youll see some of that come through those numbers as well in there as it relates to as charlie said in his remarks well lay that out in more detail in january john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay maybe a broader comment just on efficiency and where you are relative to your longerterm targets wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah i think were right on track on the plan that we laid out john and we said we would deliver about billion of impact in and that were on track to do that as charlie and i both said a number of times were not done and i think theres still more opportunity and were going through those conversations as we go through our budget process now and continuing to ph unpick the onion around where there is more opportunities so i think those that program will continue to evolve but we still feel weve got more opportunity to drive the incremental efficiency and were on track for the things we laid out charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co john the only thing i would add because i know its on a lot of peoples minds is that i mean from our standpoint theres nothing new on our thinking from what weve talked about last quarter both in terms of where the opportunities are and how were thinking about the future and we just do think that it makes sense when we get to the end of next quarter when we talk about our path to a sustainable through different cycles rotce thats also an opportunity to talk more specifically about expenses and how that fits in including what it looks like for next year and so but as to when we will have finished our budget process well understand all the puts and takes and be in a really good position to talk about it john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it okay thanks operator thank you the next question will come from scott siefers of piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thank you for taking the questions i guess i wanted to ask broadly on nii once the fed stops raising rates can you sort of discuss broadly how and for how long you could maintain positive nii momentum michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well scott i think theres a lot that needs to play out for us to answer that with any degree of accuracy right in terms of what were seeing in the economy loan growth whats happening with deposits and so forth but the only thing i would point out that you do need to keep in mind as you think about it is there will be a lag on deposit pricing and that happens in every cycle happened in the last cycle and will happen again here once the fed stops raising rates you will see a lag before deposit pricing stops going up and thats just normal and to be expected as it relates to overall nii at that point i think theres a lot of whatifs that need to go into that scenario and as we all have seen even over the last few days some of those expectations continue to evolve but i would keep in mind as you think about that the deposit pricing lag r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 yeah okay makes sense thank you and then just returning to the operating losses for a second just to help put a couple billion in the third quarter charges into context just i guess given the magnitude of charges that you guys had already taken at this point what is pushing those losses so high and what could keep them high going forward and i guess i ask this within the backdrop i know like you guys werent really there when these issues took place but just given how high theyve been for so many years just curious like whats keeping them at such a level charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah scott this is charlie ill take a shot at it and mike feel free to pipe in listen i think again if you go through things that weve said in the past and go through our disclosures we still have open regulatory matters that do relate to the past we do have litigation that relates to a series of those things which we do cover a lot of it in our disclosures and the other thing which i just as we continue to make progress and move forward and build the control environment we do find things ourselves that do relate to the environment that weve had in the past and those things have to be remediated so as ive said earlier we would like to get just both operationally and financially these things done as quickly as we can the accounting rules dictate on when you when its appropriate to take the charges and we just again want to try and be as clear as we can that were not surprised indiscernible we dont like the charge for sure but it is just the reality of the position that were in to get these things behind us and try to be clear the remarks that this isnt the end of it but we would like to move as quickly as we can on everything thats remaining to get behind us r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah and maybe ill just add one thing overall and i think even with these costs and the charges were continuing to make sure that we invest in the underlying businesses too i think charlie highlighted a little bit of that on in his remarks but weve got to keep making sure that were adding people where we need to were building up the capabilities where we need to and weve talked of about some of those opportunities in the past but we are also doing that as well as executing on the efficiency agenda to make sure the earnings capacity of the company continues to get better r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you guys very much i appreciate it operator the next question will come from ken usdin of jefferies your line is open sir ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thank you good morning charlie and mike charlie i want to ask you a followup on your comments about protecting your capital in an uncertain environment going back to the ccar when you correctly stated youve got wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 a lot of excess room and a lot of flexibility just wondering how you expect that cet1 to traject relative to where you want to keep it and what does that mean in this environment for the prospects of doing share repurchase or do you just is it a build in just keep it in the protected environment thank you michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co maybe ill start ken and then charlie can add anything i think our thinking hasnt changed much since last quarter we dont feel like we need to build from here as you know weve got about basis points of cushion over our reg minimum and buffers together and i think as you sort of look at the environment were in we just want to we want to be continue to be prudent about how and when we do buybacks i think even if you think about the third quarter and look at the rate volatility we saw in the last three weeks of the quarter and even in the last number of days of the fourth quarter now in the beginning weve seen quite a bit of volatility happening and so its just all of those things that go into the calculus we do every quarter to look at where the risk opportunities are and make sure that were just being smart about managing it charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co the only thing i would add is i think as mike said we feel very good about the growing earnings capacity of the company and certainly as we didnt look forward based upon what we actually see we feel very good about the position that were in just also and then those comments try and point out that when it comes to managing capital we should be extremely conscious of what the risks are that are around us there are swings in aoci that have impacted many of us there are these geopolitical risks out there which something could trigger something which could ultimately have a broader impact on the economy and those are all reasons just given where we sit today to be more conservative on capital rather than less conservative and so a combination of those things with our own issues just lead us to say lets just see how those things play out and that for this environment that were in is probably the best use of that capital ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc and a followup just in terms of other uses of that capital just in question you did build a reserve a little bit this quarter and allude to the potential for greater uncertainty just can you help us understand just where are you right now in a scenario weightings in terms of your reserve and charlie your point in your prepared remarks just things might turn but its just unclear to say how so how do you contemplate how do we get a better sense of what that might mean for reserves and how your view on how potential losses has changed charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co thats a hard one to answer id say when we set our when we go through the presses and set reserves i think we do what everyone else does with the cecl calculations which is we have a series of scenarios that we look at that are economically driven based upon economist view of what will happen to a series of variables that will impact our credit we then go through and figure out what we think the right weighting is for those depending on as we sit here in the environment and then models produce a bunch of results so theres just so many factors that go into it theres a lot of science behind it but theres also judgment that sits on top of it relative to how you weight these things and whether the models are ultimately right we think that on a wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 relative basis just the way we think about things to the extent you can build and be conservative you try to be but its got to be fairly formulaically driven and i would say as we sit here today were not assuming we say differently i think the comments that were making about the risks in the environment factor into how we weight the different scenario and so we do have weightings the different downside scenarios and i think thats probably as much as weve said michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co and maybe ill just add weve said this now for the last couple of quarters weve had a pretty significant weighting on the downside scenarios for a while and havent changed that i think if you look at what weve built during covid i guess a couple of years ago now relative to where we are today we havent released all of that build that happened and so all of what charlie talked about goes into the conversation and so at this point we still feel very comfortable with where we are ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood okay thanks guys charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co the only thing i want just be clear about matt is again we try and be and you have to be forward looking and so we try to be very realistic about what potential outcomes are but at the same time if our view deteriorates on the level of risk out there that could change and so getting back to the capital comment i do think its kind of weird that this all runs through the income statement and for that level its hard to predict from our perspective we do have to the way we think about reserving and the way we think about capital are very much the same ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc right thanks again operator thank you the next question comes from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning i guess just a quick followup around credit i think from a fundamental standpoint one are there any areas in particular i think you talked about i think some weakness in auto lending in the past are there any areas within the portfolio seeing any kinds of crack on credit or where youre being a little bit more careful in extending new lending and also if charlie or mike if you can talk about just your exposure within the ci book to sort of financial sponsors how your comfort level around that book and whether any of that comes back to create some credit volatility over the coming quarters thank you michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co sure maybe ill take a shot at ill start on the last piece i think youre referring to leverage finance bridge the bridge book very immaterial in terms of any impact this quarter so nothing no story there in terms of anything significant in the quarter as it relates a little bit more broadly on credit for the most part the portfolios are wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 performing really well right and if you go look in the commercial bank customers are still in really good shape on average same thing in the corporate investment bank and on the consumer side charlie pointed out a lot of the health indicators still look really good were not seeing systematic stress youre certainly seeing a little bit more stress on the lower end wealth spectrum which is in a big part of the portfolio for us and so overall so far so good in terms of the performance todate charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co so i would say ebrahim that we spend a lot of time on the wholesale side looking at inflationsensitive industries as i mentioned in my remarks and just try and get ahead where we can we dont see problems but were just trying to be very forwardlooking and on the consumer side we are were just digging were digging through all of the information that we have to look for signs of stress i think if you were to change the scale and like load the scales up significantly you start to see very very small impact on some payment rates but we saw impacts to the lower end consumer several quarters ago and those havent progressed as quickly as we would have thought so again its just we dont have our heads in the sand we sit here and we listen to the fed and take them at their word and what theyre doing is extremely powerful and so things will slow but were just trying to be prudent and the last thing i would just say is in some of our products i would say were tightening up on the edges again just to be prudent of some of the higher risk categories that have multiple risk layers to them not a big part of our production in any of our products but just trying to be smart relative to who could be impacted but at the same time continuing to be in the markets and providing credit ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just a quick followup mike what i was referring to on the ci book is the disclosures around exposure to financials exbanks so when im thinking about like asset management real estate finance anything there that we should worry about in a world where some uncertainty around how private equity holds up in this environment of higher rates thats what i was sort of getting at michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co sorry yeah if you look at the q theres some breakdown of those exposures and you can see that and at this point those are all performing really well both in the assetbacked finance space as well as the subscription finance space so nothing to call out ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator the next question will come from john pancari of evercore isi your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning i know you mentioned that youre still seeing substantial opportunity on the efficiency side for improvement and on that end can you talk about the gross cost saves i know you increased the target from wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 billion to billion this year early this year in january can you talk about the potential that could that number move higher yet again as you look at all the opportunities in front of you michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah john look im sure well provide more guidance on that or more disclosure on that in january so ill leave any specific remarks there but i just get back to like what weve been saying were not done on the efficiency journey as we execute on the stuff thats in front of us we continue to find more opportunity really across most parts of the company and so i think that will continue to evolve john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay mike thanks and then in terms of the mortgage expectation i think you indicated that you could see some incremental downside pressure there can you maybe help us size up the magnitude that you could see in the fourth quarter in terms of the incremental decline michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah well i mean if you look at the in the consumer banking and lending segment weve got the mortgage banking income there so its like a little over a couple hundred million dollars for the quarter so even a relatively substantial percentage decline is a pretty small dollar decline these days given the run rate but i think if you look at what happened this quarter we probably came in a little bit better than what we guided in july spreads were a little bit better in august than what we had forecasted but they came back down in september and so we would expect that to continue so while i think there could be some downside there its off a pretty low run rate at this point john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it okay thank you and then just one more followup on the balance sheet and sorry if you had pointed to this already but in terms of the pressure on deposit balances can you talk about maybe how we should think about potential incremental declines in deposits as we see the impacts of the rate hikes continuing to take hold michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well i think one i think youre going to continue to see pricing increase from here as we have said now for a while and so youll see pricing go up as rates continue to increase and then on the deposit side all of its somewhat natural right given the environment were in so as i pointed out in my remarks we saw the biggest dollar decline in our wealth business which is clients moving to higher yielding cash alternatives now were also seeing more broadly clients move into cash there in a couple areas where weve seen cash alternatives grow substantially not just as they migrate away from deposits so thats a piece of it and then i think on the rest of the book what were seeing on the consumer side is a lot of spending not as much people migrating away from us there may be a theres a little bit of that but its really people out there spending and then on the corporate investment bank which are going to be some of your most ratesensitive wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 deposits were seeing the activity we expected to see which is there are some clients moving into other alternatives but we still see many clients staying in cash with us as well so i would expect that theres going to be there could be some further declines as we go john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it okay thanks mike appreciate the color operator the next question comes from erika najarian of ubs your line is open miss erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning just another question on expenses if i may i guess what the market is telling us today is that so long as the core expenses are as expected the market seems to be looking through higher op losses and as we look forward and charlie and mike as you think about the budgeting process for next year i think the street expects operating losses to be improving to be a strong contributor to expense improvements going forward even off of that original billion expectation im just wondering as you think about the budgeting do you continue to contemplate adjustments on the core meaning cutting cores in cores michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co operating losses or expenses excluding operating losses erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc i meant expenses excluding operating losses i think your investors are expecting op losses to be down meaningfully even from that billion original number im wondering if you continue to contemplate on the core charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co so let me take a shot at it i would say again firstly i just want to remind what we said in the prepared comments that we just want to be as transparent as we can that we would that its quite possible and we said i think likely highly likely that well have more significant potentially significant losses related to some of these historical matters so we just want that to be on the radar screen no question excluding that our ops losses are still high what i would just encourage people to think about is i personally wouldnt model them coming down until we actually see them coming down because again as we go through and build the control environment were going to find things and we need to get that behind us and i think that should be very much of a showme proposition because again we know what you know and well see it when it happens and weve got a little bit of advanced notice because we see all the work that were doing but we continue to need to work with those things and on the rest of op expenses as we said were going to provide more specific guidance for that in the fourth quarter relative to next year and also talk about how it plays into sustainable rotce and our budget and i also want to make the point because i think this is important to everyone on the one hand everyone wants to be we all want our expenses to go down because of what it does to earnings but we are extremely i mean even wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 we live in these two worlds which is where were rectifying these issues from the past which are both building the risk and control work thats necessary and all the regulatory work and fixing the expense structure but we also very much have no intention of falling behind in our businesses and so the two paths of conversations that we have through the budget process is what are we investing in and where are we going to see efficiencies and we obviously have to make sure that were getting the appropriate amount from each of those categories overall theres no question that our efficiency ratios are not where they want them to be so directionally that just tells you how were thinking about how where that goes but when we finish the process well provide more clarity but just know that were thinking about both sides of that equation but understand where we should be more long term erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc no i think that makes sense and i think the conversation with investors charlie is sort of the next step for wells fargo in terms of accelerated investment spend right efficiencies obviously ph ratio so that makes sense and my followup question maybe is for you mike so im squeezing two parts in my second question the first is could you tell us what unemployment ratio your acl ratio today contemplates and second if you could just give a comment on where you see deposit betas trending relative to your previous expectation now that we have added basis points onto the expectation for fed fund since weve talked to you last in the quarterly earnings setting michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah let me take the first one first so if you would look at if you look at our q we do give you a kind of weighted blend of the economic scenarios and we give you a few data points unemployment rate is one of them as of the end of june the weighted make sure im on the right one the weighted number for the end of this year was growing to at the end of and well update that based on the third quarter and q when we get there on the second part of the question what was the second can you just repeat the second part sorry about that erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc deposit betas michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co sorry erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc indiscernible cumulative deposit betas changed as we contemplate given that we added basis points to the fed funds outlook since we spoke to you last in this quarterly earnings setting wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co well i think so far the betas have played out the way we expected them to do at this point in the cycle and i think as rates continue to go up we would expect them to increase and that was part of the playbook and the analysis we had done going into the environment and so thats to be expected right and if rates are going to go up even higher than we originally thought then the betas will continue to go up with that and so i think its largely at this point playing out the way we thought it would erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you operator the next question comes from matt oconnor of deutsche bank your line is open sir matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning can you give us an update on your rate positioning and thoughts on whether you want to lock it in the kind of rate level were at here or whats expected or how youre thinking about protecting yourself from potentially lower rates or what your perspective is on that thanks michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah we still have were still asset sensitive as where we stand today and so that well continue to get the benefit as rates go up but as you suggest i think most banks are thinking about not just about today but also about the other side of when rates start to peak and come back down and i think the expectations around them have changed quite substantially certainly since the second quarter but even throughout the third quarter into where we stand today those expectations have changed a lot so id say at this point we are spending a lot of time thinking about that question and how we want to protect part of the balance sheet from when rates would start to decline but we havent done anything in a material way at this point matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator the next question will come from betsy graseck of morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co good morning wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc two questions one on loans how should we think about how much more room there is for you to grow loans within the context of the asset cap realizing that tlac there is a constraint so you cant get to maybe the level as a percentage of total assets or total earning assets that you could before gfc i know its a long time ago but im just trying to understand what running room you think you have in the loan book to grow that michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah betsy i think as weve said i think even last quarter weve got room to continue to grow and be there for clients and weve got levers to pull if and when we think we need to create more capacity to do that and so at this point were comfortable that were going to be able to continue to be there for clients and theres always discretionary stuff that you can do in certain pockets of your loan portfolio and so i think weve got we feel comfortable at this point that we can still be there betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then separately on the aoci pull to par can you give us a sense as to what we should put in the model for how long that should take michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co how long what part of that should take betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc the underwater afs book right like if rates were flat with quarterend youve got michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co indiscernible when you start to increase back the aoci betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah how long does it take to accrete back the aoci michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co it takes a while betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co so you guys i think we mentioned and this came up last quarter and the expectations really havent sort of changed much and it will take a while to come back it will come slowly back year by year as the maturity of the bonds get shorter betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right no just wondering because weve seen some portfolio restructurings at other places and didnt know if you had put hedges on that would have changed the pace because obviously its meaningful to the capital outlook so just wondering if theres any color there but i guess not all right thanks operator thank you the next question comes from charles peabody of portales partners your line is open charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut i wanted to follow up on the deposit beta question as im sure youre aware treasury is talking to the tbac committee and trying to get some advice on a treasury buyback i was curious what your thoughts are about how that would affect liquidity flows potentially outofmoney market funds into the banking system and therefore how that might affect your deposit beta assumptions next year michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co i think cause and effect and how that will play into deposit betas would be a really hard question to answer i mean if that comes to bear that will be one of like many different factors that will go into what to expect from deposit levels and therefore betas over time so i wouldnt attempt to try to put some math behind that at this point charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut but at the very least would you view it as a net positive or in isolation or is it a nonevent in isolation michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co i mean it really depends on what it is and how big and size and so i think it could be that whole range it could be a nonevent or matter but i think until you have better clarity its hard to say charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut assuming its a trillion type of treasury buyback which i think is the capacity they have michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah i think its just a its a really hard question to try to put math behind at this point wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut okay thank you operator thank you the next question comes from vivek juneja of jpmorgan your line is open sir vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks charlie mike charlie i wanted to just follow up on your comment earlier about youre seeing declines in deposits below prepandemic levels in certain cohorts can you talk a little bit about that what level of balances kind of cohorts are you talking about and how much have they gone down below prepandemic levels charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co yeah ill turn it over to mike this is the same thing that we talked about in the prior quarter where those that entered the pandemic with the lowest of balances to begin with where they had balances for a period of time that remained above prepandemic levels and we started to see declines ultimately in spend and deposit levels for that now that are averaging below prepandemic levels but as i said in the prepared remarks we would have expected that i would have expected that to exacerbate and spread and it hasnt really theres still a small part of our customer base michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co yeah and vivek these are customers generally that have kind of average balances per month and theres a percentage of those customers that have seen some declines and theres also a percentage some of those customers are having right so it is just one of the different cohorts weve looked at but as charlie said that hasnt really started to go up in higher wealth cohorts or income cohorts vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and that sounded like from your comments that that decline has happened this quarter so i guess the group that were seeing it probably gets worse as inflation remains high charles william scharf a president chief executive officer director wells fargo co no michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co no this is a continuation of a trend we saw in the second quarter as well so its not necessarily accelerating in any way but its a continuation of a trend weve seen now for a number of months vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 okay mike a little one for you card delinquencies you give plus can you break that down to to days or the early delinquencies what those did this quarter michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co there will be more in the q i think vivek on that vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay you dont okay a suggestion to just have it out at earnings because obviously given that were starting to change environment its an important metric to keep an eye on michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co okay thanks operator the final question for today will come from gerard cassidy of rbc sir your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning mike good morning charlie mike can you share with us the trends youre seeing in the commercial real estate area you guys have very strong revenue growth of course in commercial real estate this quarter yearoveryear the commercial real estate mortgage balances were slightly down but were hearing from different folks that the commercial real estate market is starting to tighten up banks arent as being as aggressive in lending any color on the risk dynamics that you might be seeing and trends youre seeing in commercial real estate mortgage michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co sure let me start with just whats driving some of the growth youre seeing right so balances loan balances are up yeartodate and yearoveryear really driven by two things the growth in multifamily apartments and some growth in some industrial properties and so which still sees really strong demand i think even if you look at new housing new multifamily housing starts still growing it hasnt really turned like singlefamily homes has over the last number of months so really strong demand there i think when you look at the performance of the portfolio some of the categories that were most impacted by the pandemic hotels retail in most cases are back good cash flow values are fine and were seeing that hold up pretty well you still have some forwardlooking uncertainty in the office space just given that hasnt really translated into significant stress yet because you still have longterm leases and other things you always hear about an anecdotal issue with the property but it hasnt nothing systematic yet rolling through the portfolio i cant speak about what others are doing but i think for us youve seen good growth this year and as you go into an uncertain environment youre just youre going to try to be smart about what you put on new things you put on your balance sheet and we continue to do that but thats in the context of seeing some good growth yearto date wells fargo co wfc corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good obviously your guys cet1 ratio is well above your required level and i think you pointed out your aoci mark drew it down by about basis points would you guys consider repositioning the available for sale portfolio since youre already taking the mark through your cet1 ratio what kind of dynamics would you need to see if that would make sense for you to do that michael p santomassimo a senior executive vice president chief financial officer wells fargo co so you always look at different ways to optimize we did do a little bit in the second quarter where we traded out some mortgage im blanking on the name but the mortgagebacked securities for ginnie mae you get a little bit better rwa treatment so you do we have done some little bit of repositioning over the time and its something we always sort of look at and think at but its not something that were contemplating a big size at this point gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets
