everyone and welcome thank you for joining the call today were pleased to announce our second quarter results which zach will detail later these results are supported by our colleagues who live our purpose every day as we make peoples lives better help businesses thrive and strengthen the communities we serve now on to slide there are five key messages we want to share with you today first we are intensely focused on executing our organic growth strategies and leveraging our position of strength our robust liquidity and capital base put us in a position to drive growth and we are investing in new geographies and businesses in addition to existing businesses second we expanded net interest income and we expect it to continue to grow sequentially from the first quarter trough this outlook is supported by accelerating loan growth and sustained deposit growth to power future revenue expansion third we drove fee revenues higher in the quarter with support from our three major focus areas capital markets payments and wealth management fourth we are achieving strong credit performance with stable net chargeoffs which are tracking as expected for the year this is a direct result of our sustained and disciplined approach to credit over many years and our aggregate moderatetolow risk appetite finally we believe the net result of these actions will deliver expanded profitability from here and into and beyond i will move us on to slide to recap our performance we delivered accelerated loan growth with average balances growing by billion from a year ago annualized loan growth in the quarter was average deposit balances also increased growing billion or over the past year capital further strengthened with reported common equity tier of and adjusted common equity tier of inclusive of aoci liquidity remains top tier with coverage of uninsured deposits of a peer leading level credit quality was stable as net chargeoffs improved by basis point from the first quarter to basis points we are sustaining momentum in the growth of our primary bank relationships with consumer and business increasing by and respectively yearoveryear again this past quarter we seized the opportunity to add talented bankers were pleased to add new depositfocused capabilities in the mortgage servicing and homeowners association title and escrow areas these new teams build upon the prior investments weve made in the carolinas texas and three new specialty commercial verticals as we shared last month we are bringing inhouse our merchantacquiring business within our payments organization to further accelerate revenues and capabilities as i mentioned our disciplined positioning of robust capital and liquidity enables our ability to sustain a growth posture capital continues to increase with adjusted cet1 up approximately basis points from a year ago liquidity continues to be robust supported by sustained deposit gathering we were pleased to once again deliver top quartile results in this years ccar stress test exercise with huntingtons modeled credit losses second best in the peer group our stress capital buffer was reduced and came in at the minimum level of across our markets we see the broader economy continuing to hold up our new initiatives teams and geographies provide growth opportunities even as the broader environment for customer loan demand remains somewhat muted zach over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 zachary j wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks steve and good morning everyone slide provides highlights of our second quarter results we reported earnings per common share of the quarter included a million notable item related to the updated fdic deposit insurance fund special assessment this did not have an impact on eps return on tangible common equity or rotce came in at for the quarter adjusted for notable items rotce was average loan balances increased by billion or versus  last year average deposits continued to grow increasing by billion or on a yearoveryear basis credit quality remained strong with net chargeoffs of basis points allowance for credit losses decreased by basis points and ended the quarter at adjusted cet1 ended the quarter at and increased roughly basis points from last quarter supported by earnings tangible book value per share has increased by nearly yearoveryear turning to slide consistent with our plan and prior guidance loan growth is accelerating quarteroverquarter our sequential growth in loans into  of billion was more than double the sequential dollar growth into the first quarter this likewise drove acceleration of loan growth on a yearoveryear basis from in  to in  at our current run rate of growth annualized we are on track for the fullyear plan we expect the pace of future yearoveryear loan growth to accelerate over the course of loan growth in the quarter was supported by both commercial and consumer loan categories total commercial loans increased by million excluding commercial real estate commercial growth totaled billion for the quarter over the past year cre balances have declined by billion with the concentration of cre as a percent of total loans declining percentage points from to today even as we have managed cre balances lower all other loan balances have increased by over billion or from the prior year drivers of commercial loan growth in the second quarter included million from new geographies and specialty verticals this included fund finance carolinas texas healthcare assetbased lending and native american financial services auto floorplan increased by million regional and business banking increased by million in total consumer loans average balances grew by million or for the quarter within consumer average auto balances increased by million residential mortgage increased by million benefiting from production as well as slower prepay speeds rv and marine balances increased by million turning to slide as noted we drove another quarter of solid deposit growth average deposits increased by billion or in the second quarter total cumulative deposit beta was cost of deposits increased by basis points in the second quarter which matched the increase in earning asset yields this was half the rate of change in deposit costs we saw into the first quarter a continuation of the decelerating trends in funding costs even as deposit growth increased within the quarter there was notable further deceleration with june deposit costs only slightly higher than may we are actively implementing our down beta action plan which is further supported by the robust deposit growth huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 we have delivered this position is allowing us to selectively reduce rates and change other terms across the portfolio in advance of potential rate cuts later this year turning to slide our cumulative deposit growth since the start of the rate cycle of is differentiated versus the preponderance of peers we have outperformed by doubledigit percentage points on deposit growth over this time as a result weve been able to fund loan growth with deposits and at the same time manage the loanto deposit ratio lower over the past year which will support continued acceleration of lending turning to slide noninterestbearing mix shift is tracking closely to our forecast average noninterestbearing balances decreased by million or from the prior quarter this represents a continued deceleration of mix shift consistent with our expectations within the consumer deposit base average noninterestbearing deposits were modestly higher quarteroverquarter this was offset by a modest decelerating trend of lower non interest bearing balances from commercial depositors on to slide for the quarter net interest income increased by million or to billion we are pleased to have delivered growth offthetrough levels from last quarter and believe this inflection in revenues will continue into the third and fourth quarters net interest margin was for the second quarter reconciling the change in nim from  we saw a decrease of basis points this was due to higher cash balances with spread net of free funds flat versus the prior quarter we continue to benefit from fixed rate loan repricing with loan yields expanding by basis points from the prior quarter as a reminder we continue to analyze and develop action plans for a wide range of potential economic and interest rate scenarios for both shortterm rates as well as the slope and belly of the curve our working assumption for the second half of the year is aligned with a forward curve which projects two rate cuts by year end based on that outlook we see net interest margin relatively stable over the next two quarters at or around the level plus or minus a few basis points turning to slide our level of cash and securities increased as we benefited from higher funding balances from sustained deposit growth we expect cash and securities as a percent of total average assets to remain approximately as the balance sheet grows over time we are reinvesting securities cash flows in short duration hqla consistent with our approach to manage the unhedged duration of the portfolio at approximately the current range turning to slide as a reminder our hedging program is designed with two primary objectives to protect margin and revenue in downrate environments and to protect capital in potential uprate scenarios as of june our effective hedge position included billion of receivefixed swaps billion of floor spreads and billion of payfixed swaps the payfixed swaps which successfully protected capital have a weighted average life of just over three years and will begin to mature over the course of as these instruments mature our asset sensitivity will reduce furthermore at a measured pace over the past several quarters weve added more forward starting receivefixed swaps with effective dates starting generally in the first half of the impact of both the maturities of the pay fixed swaps and the beginning effectiveness of the receivefixed swaps will reduce asset sensitivity in a downrate scenario by approximately onethird by the middle of next year as always we will continue to dynamically manage our hedging program to achieve our objectives of capital protection and nim stabilization huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 moving on to slide our fee revenue growth is driven by three substantive areas capital markets payments and wealth management collectively these three areas represent nearly twothirds of our total fee revenues within capital markets revenues increased million from the prior quarter driven by higher advisory revenues commercial bankingrelated capital markets revenues were stable quartertoquarter we expect to sustain and build upon this level over the back half of the year supported by robust advisory pipelines in capstone as well as expected new commercial loan production payments and cash management revenue was up million in the second quarter and increased yearover year treasury management fees within payments continue to grow strongly at yearoveryear as we deepen customer penetration our wealth and asset management revenues increased from the prior year advisory relationships have increased by yearoveryear and assets under management have increased by on a yearoveryear basis moving on to slide on an overall level gaap noninterest income increased by million to million for the second quarter increasing from the seasonal first quarter low excluding the impacts of the crt transaction noninterest income increased by million quarteroverquarter moving on to slide on expenses gaap noninterest expense decreased by million and underlying core expenses increased by million during the quarter we incurred million of incremental expense related to the fdic deposit insurance fund special assessment excluding this item core expenses came in better than our expectations for the quarter with approximately half of the lowerthanexpected result driven by discrete benefits not expected to recur the increase in core expenses quarteroverquarter was primarily driven by personnel expenses as we saw higher revenuedriven compensation and incentives due to production as well as the full quarter impact of merit increases effective in march we continue to forecast core expense growth for the full year as we look into the third quarter we expect core expenses to be higher at approximately billion there may be some variability given revenuedriven compensation slide recaps our capital position common equity tier ended the quarter at our adjusted cet1 ratio inclusive of aoci was and has grown basis points from a year ago our capital management strategy remains focused on driving capital ratios higher while maintaining our top priority to fund high return loan growth we intend to drive adjusted cet1 inclusive of aoci into our operating range of to slide highlights our results from this years ccar exercise we were pleased to once again continue our trend of topquartile performance for expected credit losses from the stress test this years result was second best compared to peers our scb improved to the minimum and our modeled stress cet1 ratio was the second best in our peer group our acl as a percentage of ccar modeled losses continued to be the highest level compared to our peers these results validate the consistency of our longstanding approach to maintaining an aggregate moderatetolow risk appetite on slide credit quality is coming in as we expected and continues to perform very well net chargeoffs were basis points in  basis point lower than the prior quarter they remain in the lower half of our throughthe cycle target range of basis points to basis points allowance for credit losses at declined by basis points from the prior quarter effectively flat and reflects both modestly improved economic outlook as well as an increased loan portfolio huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 on slide the criticized asset ratio declined from the prior quarter driven by broadbased improvements across commercial portfolios nonperforming assets increased approximately from the previous quarter to basis points while remaining below the prior level turning to slide our outlook for the full year remains unchanged from our prior guidance as we discussed we expect loan growth to accelerate and deposit growth to sustain its quarterly trend we drove net interest income higher from its trough and expect that trend to continue sequentially in the second half core expenses are well managed and tracking to our fullyear outlook subject to some variability given revenuedriven compensation levels and the timing of staffing adds and expenses related to the insourcing of our merchant acquiring business we expect to exit the year at a lowsingledigit yearoveryear growth rate credit is performing well aligned with our expectations with that well conclude our prepared remarks and move over to qa tim over to you timothy r sedabres directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc thank you zach operator we will now take questions we ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related followup and then if that person has additional questions he or she can add themselves back into the queue thank you question and answer section operator thank you well now be conducting the questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you and our first question is from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please proceed with your question manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc morning manan manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc zach can you expand on your comments on how youre managing downside deposit beta if we get a couple of rate cuts by year end i think in the past youve spoken about a downside beta of or so on total deposits can that be a little bit better given that youve been more competitive on deposits in the first half of the year zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah thanks manan good morning great question ph ill just elaborate on this one well as i noted in the prepared remarks were already beginning the early stages of the down beta playbook think reducing acquisition rates shifting the acquisition mix from time deposits towards more money markets which is huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 easier and faster to manage on a down beta trajectory shortening the duration of cds and making targeted rate reductions in certain client segments so already beginning these actions and they benefited us in the second quarter as we look forward clearly the performance and trajectory around beta will be a function of what how the forward yield curve projects but clearly what clients and the markets generally believe to be the rate environment with that being said what were seeing set up now is very conducive to continuing this action and being ready to actually implement the full down beta playbook when we presume to see a rate reduction later this year so theres good confidence on where things are going in terms of that its a little early to give precise guidance here because clearly the trajectory around beta over the course of the first year or so will be a function of those market expectations but its our general working assumption that well be in the mid to high percent down beta range over the first year period and then continuing from there and at least thats sort of shaping up pretty well here ph in the early days i think manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then maybe on the loan side can you talk about how spreads are tracking weve had several banks highlighting weaker demand and loan growth but theyre all looking for loan growth so are you seeing things getting more competitive and how is that impacting loan spreads overall zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc so look it is certainly a competitive environment were driving growth as we said into the second quarter on a dollar basis we saw double the growth into the second quarter than we saw in the first quarter so the acceleration that we have been calling for for some time were seeing and so we feel pretty pleased about that part of the question on loan spreads for us overall on a net basis is where are we growing what segments what categories are we growing in and where were focused is is driving growth in a lot of the new areas that weve been investing in ph and ill specifically call on pretty attractive spreads of relative to the average i would characterize the spread environment generally is pretty flat on a product and category level and for us really focused on trying to drive capital optimization obviously into the areas with the highest return that often have the spreads but that also come with indiscernible performance as well manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator our next question is from the line of erika najarian with ubs please proceed with your questions erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc ph i want you to talk through expected deposit trends for the rest of the quarter clearly you have outpaced as you mentioned ph that the preponderance of your peers indiscernible cycle in terms of deposit growth i guess i got the impression that perhaps some of this deposit growth is prefunding even better loan growth for the second half of the year and i did notice that you indiscernible portfolio and at that rate that you mentioned that like a good move relative to the curve but im just wondering i guess the question here is can you continue to do you have enough deposit to fund the acceleration indiscernible for or are you expecting to continue to grow at this pace but closer to the rate and competitive dynamics that you observed in june in other words it wont be as expensive as plus basis points for the quarter zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks erika for the question this is zach ill take it your line was clipping a little bit as ph you went on but i think what i heard was what is our i guess expectation for loan growth and kind of deposit sorry deposit growth im sorry and deposit pricing here in the back half of the year and will we have enough to fund ph loan going forward and what the kind of rate trajectory is around that so let me see if i can address that and if i havent covered it you can follow up look i think were really pleased with how things are going on indiscernible for sure if you take a big step back outperformance versus the peer median over the course of the rate cycle with a beta that compares pretty favorably to both history and peers so really did well and what thats allowing us to do is to your question prefund to some degree of future loan growth and weve seen ph this loantodeposit ratio just last year go from this time last year to now in the quarter we just closed so sort of sets up that ability to fund with core deposits the accelerating loan growth that we expect but also i would note and this sort of goes back to manans question a second ago it gives us a lot of flexibility to really manage down beta and to be selective and disciplined in terms of where that next unit of funding will come from so that is sort of the intention and its sort of performing really well i mean to some degree indiscernible were actually outperforming our initial budget on deposit growth its one of the reasons why we elevated the deposit growth forecast up to the highend of our initial guidance range i think we saw an extraordinary level of growth into the second quarter of almost billion i dont expect that same level of sequential growth into the second quarter but i do expect it to grow and i would see some nice sequential growth into the fourth quarter too and to be within that overall guidance range of billion to billion for the full year so i think that will allow us to kind of absorb the increased lending volumes that were projecting in core fund indiscernible to manage down beta in terms of pricing strategy let me sort of go back a little bit to the answer i gave to manan which is were being judicious were still in acquisition mode but were very much cognizant of our position of strength and that can allow us to execute the early stages of our down beta so were seeing it in the marketplace reductions in goto huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 market acquisition pricing were likewise doing that and taking that opportunity and i believe that if we do get rate reductions here in september which is seems to be a certainty based on the market expectations well be able to continue that and to drive it forward even further erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you and just as a followup question to that as i try to put together everything that youve told us about deposit pricing trends continued fixed rate asset repricing and the swaps that are maturing while you started the year having a generally assetsensitive position the way your balance sheet will evolve into next year it sounds like in terms of both strategically in pricing and mechanically in terms of some of the financial engineering rolling off you will be set up to potentially benefit from that rate curve or lower short rates zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah great question ph so let me sort of address some of the thinking around nim trajectory asset sensitivity plans the objective we have visàvis asset sensitivity management over the last year yearanda half even has been to allow our national asset sensitivity to really maximize the value of the ph uprate environment which works pretty well clearly now as we think about rates topping out and then presumably beginning to fall we are strategically reducing asset sensitivity and in the prepared remarks i highlighted the combination of increasing forward starting receivefixed swaps and expiration of payfixed swaps will reduce that sensitivity by about a third between now and the end of im sorry the middle of next year and indiscernible dynamic in managing that but thats a very intentional reduction in asset sensitivity to manage in the presence of reduced rates i think indiscernible generally seeing pretty stable trends here over the next several quarters and there are two ph substantive positive factors that weve discussed over time fixed asset repricing will continue to benefit the nim second factor hedge drag about basis points of net hedge drag in the second quarter that we disclosed so that will go down to almost a neutral position by the middle of next year in an implied ph forwards area so well get some benefit from that pretty steadily here over the next several quarters the other two factors that are very indiscernible clearly are what happens with variable yields what happens with interestbearing liability costs but in our expectations youll see an accelerating and an effective down beta that will help to mitigate variable yield reductions and ph net of the things we have a pretty flat nim here i think over the longer term we do see ph some of these opportunities to drive nim higher ph gaining more upward curve upward sloping yield curve environment and that is i think what the market is expecting pretty positive about where nim will go over the long term how should we get through this initial stages of downrate erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 operator our next question is from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please state your question steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc morning steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start maybe zach for you so if we do get two cuts this year say september december zach whats your bias as it relates to the nii outlook the ph down to down where in the range you think well lead zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah great question our indiscernible where we think our basic trend is going and were generally trending pretty well in the middle of that range and thats including a couple of cuts there i do think that a lot of one of the key factors in managing a flat nim will be that continued execution on reducing the trajectory of interestbearing costs rising and then begin to driving them lower and of course the real ability to do that is a function of what the competitive environment is and what customers believe the ph rate path is and so depending on the conviction of the market and the economy broadly where the rates are going but that being said the data does continue to set up pretty good confidence for where the forward yield curve will go and so feel pretty good about our ability to do that so the other element of that clearly is loan growth and were seeing really encouraging signs there pipelines look strong solid performance in  we expect to continue to grow and accelerate on a yearoveryear basis here in the back half of the year i think we could see even faster loan growth in some of our new growth initiatives perform even better than theyre forecasted to do in our base plan pipelines there look really good and so ph it pulled through even better than our base plan and we see some upward bias on loan growth likewise ph what we havent addressed in the qa section here is we did see more cre runoff in the second quarter than we had had expected in the kind of initial budgeting to the extent that that is lower going forward we see higher loan volumes and that could lift revenues above the base plans conversely if any of those factors indiscernible the lower end but feel pretty good about indiscernible stephen d steinour q chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc the middle of the range is that what youre saying zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 thats the base plan stephen d steinour q chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thats your base plan okay thats helpful and then its funny when we look at slide youre calling out the million that was the increase in average loans for new initiatives right i dont know call it billion a year and im curious because that you could look at that and say well thats sort of a catchup you have new bankers and new verticals bring over their books but then youre saying momentum is building so would we look out from here we think about that billion run rate or so do you see upside to that as the quarters roll forward should we see more contribution from new initiatives in a dollar perspective zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc no i think im expecting to see very strong performance in these new initiatives were really pleased with how theyre doing every one of them has both customers is booking loans were seeing good performance on forward relationship in terms of deposits and fees starting to come through so really pleased with it and i also wouldnt characterize it necessarily indiscernible with deep experience in their industries and those geographies weve launched in and were just sort of driving through new client acquisition on a pretty core basis the trajectory of growth that you highlighted i expect to see a pretty steady build from here i dont know i can see acceleration per se but the trajectory indiscernible very accretive to loan growth stephen d steinour q chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc got it okay thanks for taking my questions zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you operator our next question is from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please state your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co morning everybody thank you for taking the question so i think my question is on customer overall customer demand and loans have sort of been answered but i was hoping you could maybe address auto in particular i noticed production is as high as its been in the last several years is that sort of maybe being used as a flex given sort of the softer overall growth than you had anticipated maybe earlier this year and albeit within the context of it sounds like things outside of that category are going to advance more robustly later on so just curious how youre thinking about auto and then as a followup maybe just sort of quality of that portfolio given what the kind of fluctuations weve seen in used car values slower economy et cetera stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 scott this is steve ill take the question and on business has performed very well this year and in the second quarter we expect it will continue were not using it as a buffer i think that was essentially what you were asking we just see it as a terrific opportunity some of the other banks in the last year or so pulled back on auto its created a bit of an opportunity for us and wed expect to continue generating significant volume and growth as you saw ph with the crm and as weve done in the past with our securitization we manage aggregate exposure with the book but weve got quite indiscernible at this point in terms of the quality of the book its a super prime book and so very low defaults and weve talked about this for years we focus on default frequency on the margin the used car pricing can have a slight impact on incremental loss or avoided loss on each repossession but its not going to be a big number for us either way weve shown that this book performs very well over the years we expect it will continue to do so r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then zach maybe one for you just on cost appreciate sort of the third quarter rise that then sounds like were still on track for the full year in the past i dont want to get too detailed on next year but youve sort of talked about that normalization of overall cost growth into next year any change sort of broadly to how youre thinking about that or are we still sort of on track for that as well zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc on track for that is the headline answer there we feel really good about how were managing expenses for the year theres clearly been little bit of timing delta from where we would have initially expected to where we are now but the full year looks quite in line where ph we would have thought initially and in line with our guidance ph what ill say now is as weve discussed on previous calls a steady deceleration in the rate of year overyear growth as we go throughout the course of this year i think ph expense growth last quarter was about yearoveryear ph its like around i think effectively in  that we just closed that will trend toward the lowsingledigits by the time we get to the fourth quarter on a yearoveryear basis and our expectation is well see that run that trend down into r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good thank you for taking the questions zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you operator our next questions are from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your questions ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning i guess huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc zach im not sure if i missed it just talk to us around the loantodeposit ratio do you expect that to stay as is the guidance kind of implies that but as we think about all this loan growth coming up should we expect the loantodeposit ratio to stay flat like thats where the banks are going to be managed and talk to us also about the mix of these deposits that are coming in if you can talk about like blended rates or what the nib mix of these deposits is that would be helpful thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah yeah great question i think that were really pleased with how were doing on deposit gathering and to some degree its prefunding loan growth that were expecting to continue to drive higher gear over time and so i would expect over the course of a longer time period like we see the loantodeposit ratio drift back higher again but ph it seems to be in a pretty tight range the objective weve got indiscernible over time is to grow deposits very similarly to loans and the delta would only be kind of temporary as we see trends on a relatively short ph time basis might need to diverge so on the back half of this year im expecting to see maybe slightly faster sequential loan growth and deposit growth its not so meaningful indiscernible that ratio very much fundamentally what were seeing in terms of deposit growth is the same function weve been seeing for the last several quarters underlying acquisition of new relationships is quite good we talked about primary bank household growth in consumer business bank commercial also growing a lot of new names and new customers particularly within our new growth initiatives and also importantly a couple of the new verticals weve added very much focused on deposit gathering which is very much helpful indiscernible the mix of it as i noted in one of the earlier questions is actively shifting out of more time into more money market that sort of indiscernible driver from here which will help us set up the ability to move beta down at a faster rate going forward and all thats going to contribute to just that sort of slow progression of topping out deposit costs and then bringing them back down in that decelerating indiscernible and then accelerating on the way down as weve discussed thats sort of what were seeing at this point in terms of noninterestbearing i dont think ive gotten any question on it yet but i think in materials you can see the chart where thats going were seeing a meaningful deceleration of that mix shift out of noninterestbearing into the first quarter to give you a sense from the fourth quarter billion reduction in noninterestbearing into the second quarter we disclosed only million of reduction in noninterestbearing and in fact consumer went up so we think were almost done here in terms of mix shift out of noninterestbearing and this will indiscernible in the near term ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess just one quick followup you mentioned expenses will be lowsingle digits if i heard you correctly by the end of the year does that should we be reading into that in terms of expense growth being higher lower or same as huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc so the thing with great question eb the point weve been discussing i think for a while in terms of expense growth this year was intentionally higher than what we would otherwise indiscernible running at so that we could invest in some of these new growth initiatives and also importantly invest a lot of data and automation capabilities throughout the company but that that pace of growth would reduce as we went into and that is our plan i expect to see lower growth rate of expenses in than i saw in what were seeing in and the sort of the trend is very much supportive of that because by the time well exit this year well already be exiting at a kind of run rate of yearoveryear growth thats quite low so try to maintain that lower growth rate as we go into stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc ebrahim zach has shared in the past efforts to lower growth rates in core expense levels of the bank in order to continue to invest in different opportunities revenueproducing opportunities primarily you should expect to see that from us in and beyond as well ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks steve and zach stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you ebrahim operator our next questions are from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed with your question matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i was indiscernible matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc talking about the i was hoping you guys could talk about the risk transfers that you guys have executed on theres been some coverage about it what youve done and some others in the media and i guess im just trying to figure out the logic i mean youve got strong capital youre building capital i realize youve got kind of the strong loan growth outlook but the rate that was kind of put out there in the media seems pretty high for whats a very highquality auto book as you show in the slides here so just trying to understand kind of the logic of that and the cost to the media kind of like so anything around the logic and financial impact thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 yes great questions this is zach ill take that one if you take a step back indiscernible capital plans we put these transactions in the context of the overall capital plan the plan is really twofold drive adjusted cet1 higher we were adjusted cet1 in the second quarter we intend to drive that up into our operating range of to i think were just a handful of quarters away from achieving that our ph current trajectory and then the second key objective is fund highreturn loan growth and were doing that and i think as we said that will continue to accelerate on a yearoveryear basis and then the primary driver of creating the capital to support those objectives is organic earnings and the core earnings power of the company and that really is the core focus the prime focus with that being said and just shifting now to your question on crt and clns at the margin these transactions can be very helpful for just further rwa and balance sheet optimization and so were pleased that to do a cds transaction in the fourth quarter last year and then a very successful creditlinked note transaction in the second quarter to give you a sense of the economics in the second quarter yield was exceptionally good less than a cost of capital so what i mean by that billion notional transaction against highquality indirect auto loans reduction in riskweighted assets through the transaction so billion reduction in rwa we also get almost million of funding from the transactions and the cost of that is only million into spread on a yearone basis plus modest upfront transaction costs so its incredibly efficient at the margins unlocked bps of cet1 and just continue to support those prime objectives so we look at it as very much tactical its not the core underlying driver but just these opportunistic things that come through and really pleased with that indiscernible although the economics are incredibly favorable matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats super helpful thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you operator our next questions are from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning guys stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc maybe a question for you steve how far out do you have visibility on loan growth im just im thinking a little bit more about the exit rate for nii in just curious how youre thinking beyond the next quarter or two huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc well our pipelines go out a couple of quarters and so we have visibility through not full visibility but partial visibility through the fourth quarter we dont yet have significant visibility into certain businesses though because of the nature of their relationships our distribution finance we tie back into the supply base and we get some insight from them as to what they intend to produce but on the whole we dont have significant multi quarter visibility jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc but you do see from our customer base however theyre performing well this year i think there is an expectation as rates cut down that theyll be theyre doing more even more business next year and thats a general sentiment they sort of share with you jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes thats helpful and i guess this hasnt been touched on but anything to note on credit anything youre seeing thats bothering you anything thats surprising you positively thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc so credit indiscernible continues to perform very well were very pleased with the performance year todate the outlook looks good as you know we spent a lot of time on portfolio reviews and management and its looking good so therell be some lumpiness in commercial real estate over the next couple of years for us and others in the industry but outside of that looking good and on the whole for us its not going to be an issue as you know our cre concentration continues to reduce so i think we had a little over million of office payouts over the last six quarters the hack with construction unused commitments have been absorbed so books in the cre books in good shape jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you operator thank you our final question is from the line of peter winter with da davidson please proceed with your question huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co good morning you guys had a stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning peter peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co good morning you guys had a nice rebound in fee income and then youve got the merchant acquiring coming on back inhouse starting in the third quarter which i think adds about million to fees just do you think fee income that you can continue with this momentum and kind of maybe come in at the upper end of that to range zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks for the question peter this is zach ill take that one so would share your indiscernible fee income performance was very strong we were really pleased with what we saw the second quarter was up sequentially from the first continue to run at a yearoveryear growth rate similar to the first quarter yearover year and our expectation is to land within our to fullyear range as we get into the back half of the year and weve got some of the growovers versus last year indiscernible easier with that being said i think well continue to power sequential growth here and it really is the three priority areas of focus capital markets payments and wealth management execution quality is very strong and the trends were seeing continue to be very much conducive to that payments up yearoveryear in  treasury management within that doubledigit growth driven by client concentration wealth management continues to run at very strong levels our performance advisory households up aum and net flows look really good and thats driving revenue of and in capital markets which clearly has been a little bit choppy in the back half of last year we were pleased to see what we would expect which was strong growth in the second quarter particularly in our advisory business where we know that the middle market ma has been in a challenging environment as yields were as interest rate environment was rising last year activity is now picking up and i think will sustain so im expecting sequential growth in each of those areas i think where we land in the range will be clearly a function of how well we perform in it but strong confidence well get there peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co okay and then just last question just on credit i mean as you talked about credit trends are really good if i look at the acl ratio youre at the top end of peers just how are you thinking about reserving going forward is it kind of like keep the acl ratio fairly steady at current levels and just support loan growth and i guess what do you need to see to start lowering the acl ratio brendan a lawlor a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hey peter its brendan excuse me ill take that one as you sort of noted we basically had the reserve flat this quarter of versus last quarter as the models add to the dollar amount of the reserve we just huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2024 continue to watch the volatility in just the overall market but particularly with respect to rates as well as the impact of higher ph prolonger rates on our commercial real estate portfolio so excuse me as we see stronger economic performance come through in our modeling combined with the continued solid performance of the credit portfolio thats when we would really look to start to move the reserve down more materially that will be play out over a longer period of time and so were just were continuing to watch and manage this to the right level but right now we feel like were adequately reserved peter j
