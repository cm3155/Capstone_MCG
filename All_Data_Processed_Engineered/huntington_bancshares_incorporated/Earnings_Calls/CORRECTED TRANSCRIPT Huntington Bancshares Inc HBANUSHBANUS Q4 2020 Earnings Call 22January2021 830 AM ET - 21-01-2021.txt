bancshares inc thanks mark and good morning everyone slide provides an overview of huntingtons strategy to build the leading peoplefirst digitally powered bank in the nation our results demonstrate that were driving revenue growth despite headwinds were focused on acquiring new customers and deepening those relationships to gain both market share and share of wallet we are investing in customercentric products services and digital technology that will drive sustainable growth and outperformance both today and for years to come huntington operates in intentionally diversified business model balanced between commercial and consumer which provides a good mix of revenue and credit exposure we built a competitive advantage with our consistently superior customer service and our differentiated products and services we are committed to developing bestinclass digital capabilities like our mobile banking app which has been recognized as the highest in customer satisfaction by jd power two years in a row in we introduced several new innovative products and features that will continue to serve our customers needs and differentiate huntington from the competition we are not done we have a pipeline of innovative products and features that we will release throughout the year we have a proven track record of solid execution adjusting our operating plans to the environment in order to huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 drive shareholder returns this allowed us to deliver our eighth consecutive year of positive operating leverage in our focused execution has and will enable us to ensure investments in the products people and digital capabilities which will drive sustainable longterm growth and outperformance we are particularly excited about the tcf acquisition we announced last month which provides additional scale and growth opportunities we filed the bank regulatory applications last week and announced the planned consolidation of branches we are making good progress on our preparations for integration later this year we remain on track with the previously announced schedule we expect the closing date late in the second quarter we are pleased with our results and continued momentum across the bank despite an extraordinarily challenging operating environment and im incredibly proud of the outstanding efforts of our colleagues to overcome the challenges of the pandemic as well as look out for our customers for the year we grew revenues loans and core deposits while bottom line results and eps were down due to elevated provisioning required under the cecl reserve accounting our pretax preprovision earnings increased and these are all very strong results we also closed the year with strengthening commercial loan production as expected in the fourth quarter our consumer lending businesses especially home lending and vehicle finance are continuing to provide very good loan originations our home lending business achieved record mortgage originations for the second consecutive year our deposit growth parallels the entire banking system and we do not foresee this changing any time soon our balance sheet is very wellpositioned with robust capital liquidity and our hedging strategy has reduced interest rate risk also marked the 10th consecutive year of an increased cash dividend credit quality continues to improve illustrating that our decisive and conservative actions in the second quarter appropriately identified the highest risk portions of our portfolio allowing us to proactively work with our customers as we entered im very encouraged not only by our momentum but also the underlying strengths i see in our local economies economic data shows that our footprint is recovering more quickly than the nation as a whole and our conversations with our customers support this the unemployment rate in november was below the national average in five of our seven states including our largest market in ohio at over million jobs were created in our footprint between april and november which means of the national total were created in these seven states further of all manufacturing jobs created during this period occurred in our footprint states the vshaped manufacturing recovery is fueling regional economic growth even though many manufacturers continue to face challenges from supply chain disruptions skilled labor shortages and periodic plant shutdowns related to the virus these inventory challenges are visible in the auto rv and marine industries and then form our belief that continued low dealer floor plan utilization rates could take at least several more quarters to return to longer term averages the recovery in unemployment boosted both the regions consumer confidence and consumer retail spending above the respective national averages home prices continued to appreciate especially with solid increases in ohio michigan pennsylvania and indiana the midwest also led the country in yearoveryear growth in singlefamily home sales in the third quarter up compared to for the nation huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 turning to our business were also seeing momentum we saw an uptick in commercial loan activity late in the fourth quarter consistent with our prior guidance we are also seeing continued strength in consumer lending as we entered the first quarter our commercial pipelines also are up from a year ago we expect consumer lending to remain strong and commercial activity to continue to improve over the course of the year the consistently high level of execution were seeing across our businesses strengthening commercial activity and constructive economic outlook are driving our strategy to accelerate investments leaning into the recovery to drive increasing growth over the intermediate term it also informed our decision to pursue and ultimately enter into the tcf acquisition let me now turn it over to zach for an overview of our financial performance zachary j wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks steve and good morning everyone slides and provide the financial highlights for the fullyear and the fourth quarter respectively for the fourth quarter we reported earnings per common share of return on average assets was and return on average tangible common equity was results continue to be impacted by the elevated level of credit provision expense although it was down meaningfully from the third quarter now lets turn to slide to review our results in a little bit more detail annual pretax preprovision earnings growth was for we believe this is very solid performance in light of the low interest rate environment and the economic challenges inflicted by the pandemic illustrating the underlying earnings power of the bank and the strategies were executing turning to the fourth quarter pretax preprovision earnings increased yearoveryear total revenue increased versus last year with of growth balanced between spread revenues and fee income sorry million of growth balance between spread revenue and fee income home lending was a particular bright spot in and that remained true this quarter continuing to drive fee income growth of our capital markets wealth and investment management card and payments and insurance businesses all posted continued growth in the fourth quarter i should also note the deposit service charges remained below the yearago level and elevated customer deposit account balances continue to moderate the recovery of this line total expenses were higher by million or from the yearago quarter approximately million or more than percentage points of this growth was driven by increased technology investments another million or percentage points was a donation to the columbus foundation that we made at the yearend the remaining percentage point was primarily as a net result of several unusual items including tcf legal costs and debt extinguishment costs the underlying run rate of all other expenses was relatively flat turning to slide fte net interest income increased as earning asset growth more than offset yearoveryear growth year over year nim compression as weve stated previously our main focus is driving riskadjusted returns and revenue growth in order to achieve this weve taken actions to sustain net interest income growth some of which as previously discussed will also help us manage our nim around current level for the foreseeable future on a linkedquarter basis the nim decreased basis points to as shown in the reconciliation on the right side of the slide the linked quarter decreased primarily reflected the 3basis point impact of a change in ppp huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 loan terms to delay the initial repayment this revenue recognition accounting change had not been anticipated in the original  guidance the other nim drivers shown on the slide essentially offset each other to keep the nim stable to slightly higher consistent with the expectations we provided on last quarters earnings call the anticipated forgiveness of the majority of the first round of ppp loans over the next two quarters is expected to provide a nearterm boost to net interest income and nim on a gaap basis during those periods from the accelerated loan fee recognition as we have discussed previously were taking actions now on both sides of the balance sheet to offset the inherent pressure caused on the margin by prolonged interest rate low interest rate environment managing the interest margin near current levels on an underlying basis on the earning asset side were optimizing our earning asset mix by emphasizing disciplined pricing as well as loan production in certain higher yielding asset classes we also expect to deploy an additional billion of excess liquidity into securities picking up incremental yield lastly we expect to continue to reduce our funding costs including further optimization of wholesale funding moving to slide average earning assets increased billion or compared to the yearago quarter driven by billion of ppp loans and billion increase in the aforementioned deposits at the federal reserve average commercial and industrial loans increased from the yearago quarter primarily reflecting the ppp loans on a linkedquarter basis ci loans increased modestly notably benefiting from strong production and assetbased lending in addition we saw commercial line utilization trends stabilized and auto floor plan utilization modestly increased during the quarter consumer lending continues to produce steady growth with residential mortgage rv marine and indirect auto all posting yearoveryear growth on a linkedquarter basis average earning asset growth primarily reflected the billion or increase in average securities as we executed our plan to get securities back above the first quarter of quarterend level by the end of turning to slide we will review the deposit growth and funding average core deposits increased yearon year and sequentially these increases were driven by business and commercial growth related to ppp loans and increased liquidity levels in reaction to the economic downturn consumer growth largely related to government stimulus and similar elevated liquidity maintenance behaviors as well as increased consumer and business banking account production with reduced account attrition slide highlights the more granular trends in commercial loans total deposits salable mortgage originations and debit card spend these are key indicators of behavior and economic activity among our customers as you can see on the top left chart after remaining relatively stable for the prior several months commercial loan balances excluding ppp closed the year positively thanks to strong production in december as expected even following this flurry of activity at the yearend our pipelines today are higher than they were a year ago before the pandemic as previously mentioned expected gradual normalization of commercial utilization rates provide additional opportunity which will help offset in the nearterm headwind from ppp loans as theyre forgiven and repaid over the next two quarters there were million of ppp loans forgiven in the fourth quarter its still too early to have a definitive view on the new phase of ppp but we do expect that the changes in the program that narrow the universe of small business is eligible to participate we expect that the ultimate size of the new ppp loan production to be smaller than the phase that we achieved in huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 the top right chart reflects the continued elevated deposit balances resulting from the factors i mentioned previously providing an attractive source of liquidity the bottom two charts relate to customer activity driving two of our key fee income lines mortgage banking salable originations remain historically robust particularly when taking into account the normal seasonality decline in  on the bottom right we continue to see solid yearover year growth in both debit card transaction and spend aside from the brief period of turbulence of the initial imposition of stay at home and other restrictions in  in the early days of january weve actually seen a further acceleration of debit spending driven by the recent stimulus payment that is similar to the trend we saw earlier in during the first round of stimulus slide illustrates the continued strength of our capital and liquidity ratios the common equity tier ratio or cet1 ended the quarter at up slightly from last quarter the tangible common equity ratio or tce ended the quarter at down basis points sequentially both ratios remain within our operating guidelines and our strong capital level has positioned us well to execute on our growth initiatives and investment opportunities let me turn it over now to rich to cover credit rich richard a pohle chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks zach before we get into the credit results for the quarter and the entire year i wanted to reinforce the disciplined credit approach we have followed over the years that has allowed our portfolio to come through this downturn with solid performance this was due to the foundation weve been laying for a decade now beginning with instilling a cohesive culture that everyone in the company owns risk we reduced our commercial real estate portfolio from over of capital to under and curtailed preconstruction lending such that the fourth quarter represent the lowest level of construction in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of capital that weve had since the firstmerit acquisition in we slowed leverage lending originations in and ended with leverage loans virtually flat from yearend we transitioned our healthcare portfolio to diversify away from longterm care into our publicly held products and services companies and investmentgrade hospital systems which together now make up of the healthcare portfolio on the consumer side we brought our expertise in indirect auto to our rv marine business reduced our exposure to secondlien highltv home equity these steps and many others have fundamentally transformed the makeup of the huntington loan portfolios since the last downturn im also extremely pleased with the impact of our portfolio management activities first we reduced our oil and gas portfolio by million or since september the noncore portion of this portfolio has been reduced to just million we performed a thorough portfolio review in that resulted in a net billion increase to our criticized loans and put heightened visibility on this and other highimpact credits since weve been able to reduce our crit class by million by working with our customers while at the same time effectively managing risk finally our total consumer and commercial delinquency numbers are better than a year ago we managed nearly billion of loans with payment deferrals ending the year with just million of loans with the remaining deferral turning now to the credit results and metrics slide provides the walk through allowance for credit losses from yearend to yearend you can see our acl now represents of loans the fourth quarter allowance represents a modest million reserve release from the third quarter like the previous quarters in there are multiple data points used besides the provision expense for the fourth quarter the primary economic scenario within our loss estimation process was the november baseline forecast huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 this scenario was much improved from the august baseline forecast we used in and assumes unemployment in ending the year at and increasing to for the first three quarters of to average for the entire year gdp ends the full year down and demonstrates growth for all of with that growth peaking at in the fourth quarter while a number of variables within the baseline economic scenario have improved as that many of our credit metrics for the quarter there were still many uncertainties to deal with at december the impact of the covid resurgence we face today smallerthanexpected economic stimulus package and ongoing model challenges related to covid economic forecasting we believe maintaining coverage ratios consistent with the third quarter is prudent when considering these factors slide shows our npas and tdrs and demonstrates the continued but more limited impact federal oil and gas portfolio has on our overall level of npas we expect modest oil and gas credit impacts as we head into so this will be the last time we break out this portfolio into our overall credit results in  we had four new npas over million and just one over million all covidrelated three of these customers are in michigan where the covid restrictions have impacted their ability to reopen as we signaled we also saw an increase in npas from our business banking portfolio these credits were granular with only seven exposures over million despite this total npas were reduced from the third quarter by million or and down from the second quarter peak by million or slide provides additional details around the financial accommodations weve provided our commercial and consumer customers as we forecasted on our third quarter call the commercial deferrals have dropped significantly and now totaled just million down from million in  and billion at  we expect to have limited commercial deferral balances beyond sba going forward commercial delinquencies are very modest at just basis points our consumer deferrals have largely run their course as well down to just million as of december with postdeferral performance in line with our expectations across all the portfolio segments our deferrals in auto rv marine and home equity have nearly all lapsed and we are managing these portfolios consistent with our prepandemic strategies we expect the remaining mortgage deferrals will continue to work their way down to a de minimis level over the next quarter slide provides a snapshot of key credit quality metrics for the quarter our credit performance overall was solid net chargeoffs represented an annualized basis points of average loans and leases im pleased to report our level of criticized loans was reduced by over million or in  which is on top of the million or reduction we saw in the third quarter our active portfolio management process enabled us to identify potential problems early working with our customers we continue to proactively remedy a number of these loans i would also add our nonperforming asset ratio decreased basis points linkedquarter to basis points our second consecutive quarterly decline in npas as always weve provided additional granularity by portfolio in the analyst package and the slides let me turn it back over to zach zachary j wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks rich before we get to expectations i want to spend a minute on our ongoing technology investments and progress on digital engagement looking at slide and you can see a few select illustrations of our continued progress on digital capabilities in for example we significantly expanded our new product origination capabilities to mortgage home equity business checking and savings and small business lending you can also see continued growth in digital engagement and usage levels in consumer and business banking huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 as weve noted were investing in clearly defined digital development roadmaps across all our major business lines that will help us drive momentum delivering differentiated products and features that will drive new customer acquisition relationship deepening with existing customers and servicing efficiencies both internally and for our customers finally before we get to your questions lets discuss huntingtons expectations for the fullyear on a standalone basis excluding tcf as shown on slide looking at the average balance sheet for the fullyear we expect average loans to increase between and reflecting modestly higher commercial loans inclusive of ppp and midsingle digit growth in consumer loans excluding ppp we would expect to see mid single digit growth in both categories as the economic recovery progresses we expect continued acceleration of loan growth over the course of the year with respect to deposits we expect average balance sheet growth of to due to the elevated levels of commercial and consumer core deposits which we expect to persist for several more quarters compared to the fourth quarter average balances we expect modest deposit growth primarily among consumers during the first half of the year before stabilizing in the second half we expect to post fullyear total revenue growth of approximately to and fullyear total expense growth of to with respect to revenues we expect net interest income to be flat to modestly higher driven by average earning asset growth and a relatively stable nim compared to the fourth quarter level this guidance assumes the positive impact from the acceleration of ppp fees in the first half of the year before settling back down in the second half however noninterest income is expected to be flat to modestly lower due to the challenging mortgage banking comparisons partially offset by continued growth in capital markets card and payments and our wealth and investment management business lines the current economic outlook presents compelling opportunities to invest in our businesses to meaningfully gain share and accelerate growth over the moderate term and we intend to capitalize on that expense growth in is expected to be driven by our ongoing strategic investments in digital and technology development marketing and select personnel ads directly related to our strategic initiatives the remaining underlying run rate of noninvestment expenses is essentially flat the investments were making are heavily frontend loaded resulting in notably higher yearoveryear expense growth rates in the first half of the year while expense growth is expected to outstrip revenue growth over the near term our commitment around positive operating leverage remains over the long term our expectation is to bring the expense run rate to a level that is lower than the growth rate of revenue during the second half of finally our credit remains fundamentally sound we expect fullyear net chargeoffs to be around the middle of our average through the cycle target range of to basis points with potential for some moderate quarterly volatility reserve releases remain dependent upon economic recovery and related credit performance as a reminder all expectations are standalone for huntington and do not include consideration made for the recently announced acquisition of tcf now let me turn it back over to mark so we can get to your questions mark muth senior vice president directorinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 thanks zach melissa we will now take questions we ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related followup and then if that person has additional questions he or she can add themselves back into the queue thank you question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley please proceed with your question kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thanks good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning ken kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i was hoping you could provide just a little more information around the inputs too in terms of your allowance calculation and the reason i ask that i think most banks have this quarter seen significant improvement in their acl call it near zero or certainly negative provision expense and from what they tell us theyre also being quite conservative in terms of some of their assumptions around economic improvement would just love to try to understand i mean to the extent possible like how youre thinking about your allowance differently than what they are and kind of why your provision expense was certainly much higher than sort of the trend that weve been seeing across the bank space this quarter thank you richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah sure ken this is rich ill take that so as i mentioned in the prepared remarks we used the november base case as the kind of the driver but we use multiple scenarios and i think if you look at the base case assumptions the november base case assumption going back to december where we snapped the chalk here a number of them are in doubt and some of them are still in doubt today as it relates to the amount of stimulus the covid assumptions that are built into that and so as we look at not only what the economic forecasts are saying but some of the more qualitative and subjective assessments that we make as part of our process most covid related we didnt feel that there was enough certainty in those forecasts to rely solely on those and so there was a fair amount of qualitative judgment that we put into the process like we do every quarter to land the the stimulus is still up in the air all those other types of things we just thought it was premature to have a significant release keep in mind too that we also had loan growth in the fourth quarter so about million of our provision expense was driven by loan growth kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 all right great no thats helpful audio gap slightly related unrelated question so peoples united yesterday announced that theyre exiting their instore branches the relationship they have in stop shop and on the call they actually made kind of a compelling case for why store branches kind of just dont make a lot sense anymore i know you guys have longterm contracts with giant eagle et cetera if you didnt have those contracts would it still make sense to have the instore branches does that value proposition still work stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc ken this is steve weve been well served by the instore branches in the past and you remember we went into those almost a decade ago but last week we announced last week we filed our federal reserve and occ applications so its monday a week ago and in those apps we announced the consolidation of branches and we have a very large instore partnership with meijer and giant eagle but as a result of the combination with tcf in michigan weve been in a position where were going to be consolidating branches very substantially in michigan and that will allow us to cycle out of the instore branches that we have with meijer which weve explained to the company just excess distribution with nearly points of distribution in the state of michigan as a consequence of the combination so we are adjusting that partnership there are other things we will look forward to doing with them and so a few ideas on the drawing board as well with giant eagle we have consolidated a number of branches over the last year theres the potential to further consolidate around instore to traditional as we go forward we do think the weve been well served by the nature of the economics around the instore branches but there is a changing distribution frankly a thinning of distribution as we move forward and as weve seen over the past year with the pandemic more and more home goods delivered including groceries and so store traffic volumes are up and revenues are up traffic is down in preference for doing banking activities and the instores is changing a bit now having said that we see very very strong performance in the tcf instores which are in even denser metropolitan areas than we have with our two partners so we like the weve liked the channel over time and continue to like aspects of it and were committed to going forward to giant eagle for the next several years and then well assess the tcf partners as we move forward but again theyre roughly times times the average size of huntington instore branches theyve been added a very long time they have very patterned behavior so i suspect were going to like what we see as we get further along with it kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore isi please proceed with your question john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning john huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi on your net interest margin outlook i appreciate the color you gave for relative stability for the fullyear margin versus can you help us a little bit with how to think about the margin over the next couple quarters here particularly in the next quarter just in terms of the trajectory given the liquidity levels how should we think about that thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah hi this is zach ill take that question look i think the margin outlook is to be relatively stable here over the next several quarters and through the course of i do expect some calendarization whereby the first half of the year will be moderately higher than the second half given ppp loan acceleration expected from the first round of ppp were expecting by the way about of those ppp loans from round one to be forgiven approximately half and half between  and  and so that will drive some incremental net interest margin in the first couple quarters but generally relatively flat over the period john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thanks zach that helps and then separately also on the margin i know you mentioned the efforts to support the stability of the margin on the security side i want to see if you can give us a bit of color around what youre putting money into what types of securities and what types of yields youre seeing and then separately you also mentioned that youre emphasizing growth in higher yielding asset classes what loan areas would you flag from that perspective thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah no problem great question ill take that again this is zach so in  as i mentioned in my script we brought the securities portfolio back up to  levels from endpoint to endpoint  to  give you a sense of that billion of additional securities on a net basis and the average yield we were getting on that was to give you a sense portfolio was running at but still a pretty solid yield and the mix pretty similar to what weve invested in the past mainly mortgagebacked as we go into one important thing that i also said in my prepared remarks but i would highlight now is that we are intending to invest an additional billion mostly in the first quarter to bring the overall securities portfolio up to billion as a result of this continuing to monitor and watch the excess liquidity level and optimize the balance sheet likewise those purchases are expected to be in the mortgagebacked securities structures most notably with a range of yields that were forecasting sort of between so pretty similar as we go forward were watching pretty closely any new rounds of stimulus and certainly the latest round of ppp which could cause us to increase that goal over time well have to see where those land but thats kind of where were running with those ill pause for a second and move on to the other element you other aspect of the question you asked in terms of what assets were looking at huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 just taking a step back on our balance sheet optimization program we are very confident in it were already starting to see the traction of it and split about half and half from funding optimization in that asset growth mix optimization and when you think about the asset growth mix optimization its really focused on higher yielding products like small business administration production where were as you know the nations leading producer and also commercial categories like equipment finance assetbased lending those are really the biggest focus areas that i would call out for you as a headline john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thanks zach zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey was hoping you might walk through the sort of the tweak to net chargeoff guidance from last month i mean it certainly seems clear that credit concerns are kind of melting away for the industry but just sort of over the past six weeks what in your mind has changed to take you from sort of the upper half of the through the cycle range to sort of lowering that band as well richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah its rich ill be happy to take that it was a few things one we just got more visibility on the post deferral experience that weve seen on both our consumer and commercial customers and as those deferrals are winding down theres really no lagging credit impact that we saw there the other piece of it is just continued strength in the oil and gas sector we had a lot of chargeoff activity in we do not expect to see chargeoffs of that magnitude certainly of that magnitude in so we brought that forecast down a little bit but generally were seeing some decent traction with our commercial customers and the consumer book continues to perform very well so those were the major things we tweaked the guidance i think is the right way to say it we didnt it wasnt a wholesale change but we do feel better about the portfolio heading into zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 rich if you dont mind ill add to that scott yearend delinquencies better than a year ago precovid on the commercial side the multiple quarters now of lower npas lower crit class the economic outlook the combination of factors and i think the oil and gas component of our chargeoffs last year were midteens like bps bps richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc basis points zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc bps so thats eliminated we dont expect to have oil and gas chargeoffs and then the highrisk industries continue to look good we obviously spend a lot of time on those every quarter so at various times during the quarter especially as we get to quarterend theres a lot of deeper review thats triggered and frankly looks good r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you for that and then the final question was zach you talked a couple times about optimization of wholesale funding just curious as you look through the course of the year maybe some color on the kind of opportunities or options you have there zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah i think itll be kind of more of the same of what weve talked about before which is leveraging the really strong liquidity and deposit gathering weve got to reduce overtime the overall wholesale and corporate debt levels you saw us extinguish million of debt in our tender that we did in  i think its just kind of the opportunity to continue to leverage more core deposits to fund the company frankly over the course of this year this question of elevated liquidity and how long it will stay is sort of the question but were fairly convinced its going to stay for a while and it will likely go up frankly in the near term given some of the new things that are coming through so theres a real opportunity there and behind the scenes our account acquisition are deepening and deposit gathering on a core basis is accelerating as well so i think as we get through this year that will just continue to be an opportunity well out into and beyond r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yes okay perfect thank you guys very much zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steve alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your question steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning steve zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i like to start on the expense side looking at the to guidance for its a bit above steve you said you plan to lean in and position the company better for an economic recovery can you give more color is this an investment in more people systems customerfriendly products like give us some sense of what youre investing in here zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc absolutely as i mentioned in my prepared remarks this is zach as i mentioned in my remarks and i would like to stress again essentially the entirety of that growth driven by our investments and our strategic plan and you could think about just three broad categories its approximately technology development around marketing and around select personal ads that are tied to our strategic growth initiatives so it really is all about investment in the tech side were just continuing to lean in on digital and as i mentioned in my remarks digital or development roadmap across every one of our business major business lines to drive product origination account deepening and sort of ease of use and servicing efficiencies and personalization and optimization across each product lines and were incredibly bullish about that the investments themselves the expenses are going to be frontend loaded during the year so well see substantially higher levels of growth in the first half of the year and then ramping down pretty significantly in the back half of the year such that by the kind of run rate expense growth will be lower than the growth rate of revenue in the second half but just to summarize we really feel now is exactly the right time to make these investments and were already starting to see some of the returns from them so feel good about it and thats the trajectory and composition of it steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful for my followup question so your commentary on loan pipeline the customer sentiment is favorable but my question is given this enormous buildup of deposits right the whole industry is seeing when you look at your middle market customers are they sitting on a ton of cash which might delay their appetite to actually draw on lines thanks stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc its almost a tale of two worlds steve in that regard we have many customers that are very liquid you see it in commercial line utilizations with us and the industry as a whole there are some however that are either significantly investing rebuilding inventory or frankly have not had the fundamental performance for whatever reasons it could be covid related they just didnt have a good year i do think the stimulus will that was that huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 has been provided plus the proposed one if its inactive will further delay sort of the rebound to the norm in terms of line utilizations but that will be a big tailwind for us and others eventually we do see supply chain disruption also impacting utilization its very clearly happening in the dealer floor plan side for example notwithstanding it improved a bit in the fourth quarter its not where its not normalized and it will probably several quarters before it becomes normalized so all of that is to say that theres this tailwind building for the industry and we may see it in the second half of this year which is i think consistent with how many banks are expressing both gdp growth and optimism as well as the potential for utilization that there will theres a lot of investment activity thats going on and theyre using their cash but at some point that will revert to a more traditional level of external financing bank financing as well so were moving market share a bit with the growth that were achieving through the fourth quarter and projecting and were optimistic given the pipelines well continue to do that but at some point well have a substantial tailwind as well steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and your plan to lean in on the investment is pretty heavy early in the year and capture more of that in the back half stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc it is and as zach said particularly on the digital side if you think about how consumers and businesses are being trained via apple or amazon in terms of digital usage availability ease of capacity to accelerate transactional activity all of that is going to impact our industry and therefore weve accelerated our existing digital plan substantially to try and continue to get stay in front get in front and maintain that jd power leading position that weve had for a couple of years steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay terrific i appreciate all the color stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc absolutely operator thank you our next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america please proceed with your question erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch yes hi good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch a followup question good morning a followup question on the net interest income guide appreciate the color on reallocating billion of cash in the first quarter as we think about average deposits up to against loans up to zach im wondering what you were assuming for liquidity build in your outlook for net interest income flat for the rest of the year and are you contemplating any growth from ppp as well as forgiveness income from ppp in your guide zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah thanks erika great question i mentioned in one of my previous comments that it is sort of the question frankly in terms of how long the elevated deposits will last but generally what were expecting is a relatively flat trend in our deposits at the fed for the first half of the year to give you a sense in  was around billion we expect to sort of maintain that rough level through the first half of the year and then kind of absent the new stimulus and absent the new ppp our operating outlook had been for sort of a gradual reduction in that toward the back half of the year but not that substantial maybe down to by the end of the year in terms of billion i think the with that being said well see about any new stimulus coming through on the fiscal side and likely if that does happen well see that be elevated even more and could as i mentioned given opportunity to invest more in securities and likewise ppp the next round of ppp is just now kicking off were not sure exactly where its going to land well see for my guidance ive assumed around a billion but im hopeful and its quite likely to be potentially up to double that well see in terms of the ppp forgiveness at the first round i think i mentioned in the prepared comments but just to restate it for clarity were assuming of the billion that we had on sheet in  to be forgiven in the first half of the year erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it ill follow up on the modeling call on the forgiveness for ppp my second question is more for steve to basis points is quite an accomplishment for the kind of economic downturn we have experienced and im wondering do you think that the government has been successful at redefining what the cycle peak is for this downturn in that the to basis points represents the peak in losses that well see during this cycle or do you think theyve just delayed it to stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc erica i dont believe the losses are materially delayed in our case i cant answer for other institutions but it seems to me that the proactive efforts by both the federal reserve and the fiscal multiple rounds of fiscal stimulus that substantial losses have been likely avoided as support has been delivered to consumers and small business and the interest rate levels at historic lows have helped businesses generally so i think history will show these very strong actions have mitigated what otherwise could have been a very ugly period in our economic history if we think back to the second quarter and the free fall in gdp to be able to substantially reverse that in just a couple quarters is remarkable unlike anything weve seen in our history and i think that flows then through the system with lower accumulated losses over time i think weve been conservative maybe very conservative in our loss recognition thus far but weve tried to maintain that to that posture as you saw with how we approach huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 provision in fourth quarter just to let this season and get to a high level of confidence before we do things with lowering reserves in total or things like that but im very optimistic and confident that we have our losses peaked in erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thank you and mark is going to kill me but i have to squeeze in this third question and steve this is for you it feels like the this is more a testing of a thesis but expenses up to it seems like youre very much looking forward and saying look this is a year where we may likely have significant reserve release if the economic outlook pans out and the streets not going to give us much credit for that earnings anyway why not pull forward the expenses and have a great first full year in for both as a standalone company and as a combined company any thoughts there stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc well that is not the intended approach remember we have to call the reserves as we see them we have multiple economic scenarios and a peak second round i hope a peak second round of the virus as of yearend now that is a possible scenario but thats not a planned scenario ph on par revert to what zach said a minute ago the core expenses are virtually flat in versus the increases are discretionary investment decisions made as a consequence of the strategic planning and the posture we want to take principally around digital technology so we believe we have a momentum in the business were one of the few banks that talked about commercial loan growth and our pipeline yearoveryear is better in a covid environment than it was in a precovid environment so like what weve been able to build operating a company through this very challenging period of time in terms of momentum and focus and execution and were going to continue to play that against the backdrop of consumer and business demands changing radically as a consequence of digital and the need for digital throughout the pandemic and again i think usage is being defined by others by amazon and apple and others and so those expectations are i believe going to be a reality for our industry and certainly our company and were going to invest to meet those if not get ahead of them erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it it makes sense to me thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc yeah operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your question ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 thanks hey good morning everyone one followup on the nii side zach just wondering if you can parse it just if you just think about the allin ppp that was in the nii versus visàvis how youre talking about overall nii for the year if theres a way you can help us understand that thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah i think looking at my notes here just and we can follow up more on the modeling call too looks like about basis points of benefit on a fullyear basis in the nim from the ppp program in to give you a sense ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc and what was that in zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc basis point ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it so a little bit higher makes sense okay and then the second question is on the consumer loan side youre talking about really good growth there again midsingle digit growth but auto has been flat for several quarters now youve grown in some of the other categories just wondering specifically to auto just how youre feeling about growing that book going ahead and then if thats expected to stay flat where would you expect to see the rest of growth coming from on the consumer side thanks stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc the auto industry was like a million million production in and the outlook is closer to million going forward for so that will be part of it theres also a market share component that will be i think just because of our consistency and track record it will continue to move and yet maintain the spreads that were looking for as well as credit quality we are also opening up or planning to open up in a few additional states in that will also supplement our production so were confident our team has been outstanding in this area for many many years were confident in our ability to execute that we also i think were number five or six nationally in terms of home equity originations so its not just mortgage so were not dependent wholly on mortgage refi weve a lot of broadbased home lending capabilities and investments in technology in that area as well which will continue to drive more volume we have a substantial implementation of blend for example that has been ramped up very quickly and will be an important chain a very important app for us as we go forward i think were taking about days off at the close as a result of using that as an example ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thank you steve operator thank you our next question comes from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities please proceed with your question huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning i was wondering you gave stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc hello peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning you gave some guidance that mortgage banking is going to be challenging which is good for all banks just wondering if youd give a little bit more color how youre thinking about mortgage banking off the fourth quarter level if you could give a little bit more guidance zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure yeah absolutely this is zach ill take that one so mortgage banking had kept coming off and its just an incredible year in to give you a sense of the industry mortgage making association is forecasting volumes in down about with a shift toward purchase not surprisingly with revised being very substantially lower our vault weve actually been gaining share on app volumes over the last several years and we expect to continue to do so so our general expectation for app volume is sort of down in the to range relative to that or more down at an industry level i think one of things were watching pretty closely is also the salable spread and where that trends weve frankly budgeted pretty conservatively on that assuming a relatively continual trend back to more historical levels by the end of the year well see so far theyre actually holding up fairly solid in the first days of  and well see that those are volatile as you know but generally we budgeted fairly conservatively so i think mortgage banking income going to be down year on year and so as i said as i mentioned really leaning into the other fee income lines that are growing smartly to offset that peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thanks and if i can ask about the tcf acquisition im just wondering obviously you havent closed the deal but any way you can quantify maybe a range for potential revenue synergies i know its not part of your guidance and then secondly what would you say the top three revenue opportunities with this deal stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc peter ill take that and let me start i think i was a bit brusque with an answer to a question you had last time so with apologies for that but picking up on tcf we havent talked a lot about revenue synergies but they are clearly there we have a much broader product than on both the consumer and business side so the capacity to crosssell and deepen much like we saw with firstmerit is very substantial and its hard to take that in and certainly not something you guys want to hear so we havent front run that with you but with them is definitely a case weve been very impressed with the quality of the teams that weve seen in a variety of the areas in tcf both business line and technology and some of support areas for example and so i think we will be a stronger company by the blend as well and that will have upside then finally they do some things extraordinarily well huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 their equipment finance business terms or finance business these are little jabs and theyre not widely known or appreciated but we really like what we saw in diligence and have learned subsequently and those are just a few of the businesses and opportunities theres a substantial outsourcing as well both on the capital market side for most products and again its a much more limited venue than we offer as well as their broker dealer their credit card its a variety of businesses that will bring back in fairly quickly as we move forward so theres the expense and we just articulated a branch consolidation so you can see where thats coming from itll be their systems to ours so weve got a lot of early on very very good work thats getting us bullish on the expense side but the play here is a revenue play new markets exciting new markets minneapolisst paul denver colorado springs more than tripling us in chicago opening in milwaukee and silicon valley i mean theres a lot to go for plus the scale change in michigan will be a one or two and virtually everything in michigan so we really like the revenue side of this and youll see that reflected in and beyond as we get set peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thanks steve operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed with your question bill carcache q analyst wolfe research thank you good morning hey guys i had a followup question on autos specifically slide your mix of new originations increased to this quarter can you speak to the notion that new vehicle financing is an area where the captives have a greater edge over indirect lenders because their primary goal is helping their oems move steel so theyre willing to compromise a bit more on pricing does that have a i guess is having a greater share of new vehicle origination suggest that you guys are getting lower margins than you would if you had a larger mix of used if you could just kind of comment on the profitability of used versus new vehicle financing that would be helpful stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc bill this is typical seasonality of new model introduction and so as we look back wed see essentially the same ratios yearoveryear albeit this year a bit constrained by just inventory so youre right the oems will ph sort of vet that and thats why we tend to have slightly more used than new as a sort of a normalized run rate as you know weve been very very disciplined for many many years in this area and so the performance of the book has been very consistent and would expect that to continue to be so its our bestperforming asset class year in year out on dfast as an example so we really like our positioning with the product with the dealers the consistency and speed at which we offer we think weve got a bestinclass capability was clearly one of our most seasoned teams in the bank managing this area and so i dont see a big change going on there are times when the oems will submit more to try and drive more volume and history will tell us these things come in waves bill carcache q analyst wolfe research huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 thats very helpful steve im sorry if i missed this but wanted to follow up on you made a comment in your prepared remarks around dealer floor plan levels and how it will take longer for balances to return back to historical levels does that presume that dealers will be running with less inventory than they have historically in sort of kind of a new normal postcovid environment or do you think that well see like a reversion to historical inventory levels stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc we expect a reversion to the norm its a supply chain issue at this point for example you would have seen all this manufacturing interrupted by just a chip last week in terms of production so this will come back we believe probably at this point by the in the second half as opposed to earlier and some of the imports in particular are feeling constrained on the supply side youre going to see more and more manufacturing come back into the us or pick up on mexico canada as a result of wanting to narrow the supply chain lines a consequence of whats happened over the last year and thats a benefit to us bill carcache q analyst wolfe research got it thats very helpful thank you thank you for taking my questions stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thanks bill operator thank you our next question comes from line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning guys stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks for letting me come in here at the end of the queue but what couple of cleanups rv marine you had some pretty strong growth and maybe some of that is covidrelated last year do you expect the mean reversion there what are you thinking about in terms of growth potential there and just longer term thinking about asset value there zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc the industry outlook on that jon is for a continued high purchase levels for the next couple of years and were positioned for that very very well as you know thats an fico for us so we worry a bit about oversupply in the intermediate term but the positioning of our book i think will very very substantially mitigate what could be a huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 three or five years of bit of access so i think weve played it we are playing it very very well and well have consistency of performance with 800plus average fico for the foreseeable future and i think thats what you were getting to these supplydemand potential imbalances would come back out of covid but that could exist right now theres virtually very little on bringing lots as of the end of the third quarter its building again but demand could outstrip supply as it did in and to a certain extent that happened with rv as well so i think theres a very good couple of years and where were playing i believe is very safe for the long term and profitable jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc good okay and richard question for you your guidance is great but the one thing were all trying to plug in is the provision and reserve level and so i wanted to go back one more time to this you used the term snap a chalk line in december which i think ive never heard on the call before but its excellent you talked about using the november base case you look at december and january it was different you use moodys its clearly better you talked about in your qualitative youre waiting for stimulus thats a little bit uncertain is it as simple as if we get the stimulus and this january moodys holds we get some improvement in february the reserves just have to come down dont they is that the right way to look at it richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah i would say absolutely the reserves have to come down its just a question of the timing and where they come down to we started the the cecl day one was and were up to i would imagine at some point were going to get back to the neighborhood of the where we started but i would say that were also not targeting a specific time to get there i think as i pointed out were going to be prudent on we were conservative on the way up and well be prudent on the way down to make sure that were not kind of whipsawing the provision on a quarterbyquarter basis overreacting to one data point along the way i think its we sit here and run a very disciplined process every quarter looking at not only the quantitative pieces of it but the more qualitative pieces and when we feel that those are aligning and our credit quality continues to hold which we expect that it will well bring the reserve down and i would say that that is more likely to happen in the back half of the year than first quarter certainly jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good thanks a lot yes okay thanks a lot i appreciate it operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes our questionandanswer session ill turn the floor back to mr steinour for any final comments stephen d steinour chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you for the questions and your interest in huntington certainly proud of
