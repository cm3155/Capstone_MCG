the call today were pleased to announce our third quarter results which zach will detail later our approach to both our colleagues and customers continues to be grounded in our purpose our colleagues again demonstrated that we make peoples lives better help businesses thrive and strengthen the communities we serve now on to slide there are five key messages we want to leave you with today first huntington is extraordinarily well positioned to manage through the evolving landscape for banks the nearterm environment includes higher for longer interest rates an uncertain economic outlook expected new capital regulations as well as heightened regulatory requirements huntington operates in this dynamic period from a position of substantial strength our balance sheet and risk profile were intentionally built over more than a decade explicitly for these times our market position digital leadership and momentum and core growth strategies put us in the top of the peer set we intend to lean into this position of strength to drive incremental growth through existing and new capabilities second weve managed top quartile cet1 inclusive of aoci we will continue to drive additional capital expansion for the remainder of this year and over the course of third we benefit from a cultivated granular deposit franchise and have delivered consistent core deposit growth our balance deposit base forms the foundation of our robust liquidity framework and has been a driving factor in our wellmanaged beta over the rate cycle today huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 fourth credit quality remains strong across our portfolios driven by our disciplined customer selection underwriting and rigorous portfolio management this approach is unwavering starting with our tone at the top as we maintain our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite finally we remain intently focused on our core strategy we are executing with discipline while expanding with existing and new capabilities to support our longterm growth and very importantly we are remaining steadfast in our commitment to drive operating efficiency over time with continued execution of proactive expense management programs we expect the level of uncertainty in the nearterm and some level of higher expenses to manage through the realities of the current operating environment however these investments will also be accompanied by sustained revenue growth and the net result will be a huntington that continues to be a strong regional bank with significant growth opportunities ahead i will move on to slide to further illustrate our position of strength our adjusted cet1 ratio is strong and near the top of the peer group we intend to drive this ratio higher throughout this year and this plan extends our position of strength supports continued execution of core growth strategies and puts us well ahead of the proposed basel iii endgame and other requirements deposit growth has also outperformed our peers by nearly percentage points since the end of we built one of the most granular deposit bases with a leading insured deposit percentage and we continue to drive the expansion of primary bank customer relationships our liquidity is best in class for coverage of uninsured deposits representing nearly twice the level of peers and we already meet the liquidity coverage ratio on an unmodified basis credit metrics are also a differentiator for huntington with top quartile net chargeoffs compared to peers and our credit reserves are top tier our management team has a long track record of disciplined execution for example we were recently named the number one sba lender nationally for the sixth consecutive year and we continue to expand the reach of this business and our support of access to capital for small businesses interest rates continue on a path towards the higher for longer scenario which weve been anticipating for some time as rates remain higher the potential for economic activity to be negatively impacted has increased however thus far in the cycle overall our customers are effectively managing through it we remain highly vigilant and are proactively managing all loan portfolios our top tier credit reserves and expanding capital support our approach to be front footed to take advantage of opportunities to new customers and grow our businesses zach over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance zachary j wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks steve and good morning everyone slide provides highlights of our third quarter results we reported gaap earnings per common share of and adjusted eps of the quarter included million of notable items which impacted eps by per common share return on tangible common equity or rotce came in at for the quarter adjusted for notable items rotce was further adjusting for aoci underlying rotce was average deposits grew during the quarter increasing by billion or loan balances decreased by million or onehalf of from  driven both by seasonality and our continued optimization net interest income on a dollar basis expanded quarteroverquarter driven by a rising net interest margin we continue to proactively manage expenses and have begun a new set of incremental actions in the third quarter including branch consolidation staffing efficiencies and corporate real estate consolidations these actions coupled with our huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 ongoing longterm efficiency programs as well as the measures we implemented in  of this year will help us drive rigorous baseline expense efficiency while sustaining capacity for investments in the franchise credit quality remains strong with net chargeoffs of basis points and allowance for credit losses of return on capital was robust driving capital accretion with reported cet1 now above turning to slide as i noted average loan balances decreased onehalf of from  driven primarily by lower commercial loan balances which decreased by billion or from the prior quarter on a yearoveryear basis average loans increased reflective of our intentional optimization efforts primary components of the commercial loan change included cre balances which declined by million driven by pay downs distribution finance decreased million due to normal seasonality with lower dealer inventory levels in the third quarter before the expected inventory build in the fourth quarter asset finance decreased by million auto floorplan increased by million all other commercial categories net decreased as we continue to drive optimization towards the highest returns in consumer growth was led by residential mortgage and rvmarine while auto loan balances declined for the quarter turning to slide as noted we continued to deliver consistent deposit growth in the quarter average deposits increased by billion or from the prior quarter turning to slide we saw sustained growth in deposit balances in the third quarter including sequential increases during july august and september continuing the trend we have seen previously importantly core deposits represented the entirety of the deposit growth for the quarter with broker deposits declining quarteroverquarter turning to slide noninterest bearing mix shift continues to track closely to our forecast with the deceleration of sequential changes that we would expect at this point in the rate cycle the noninterest bearing percentage decreased by basis points from the second quarter and we continue to expect this mix shift to moderate and stabilize during onto slide for the quarter net interest income increased by million or to million driven by expanded net interest margin we continued to benefit from our asset sensitivity and the expansion of margins that has occurred throughout the cycle with net interest income growing at cagr over the past two years reconciling the change in nim from  we saw an increase of basis points on a gaap basis and an increase of basis points on a core basis excluding accretion the drivers of the higher nim quarteroverquarter were higher spread net of free funds lower fed cash balances versus the prior quarter and higher fhlb stock dividends in the quarter interest rates rose during the quarter particularly at the longerend and as we expected that drove a net benefit to nim in addition our optimization efforts across both loan growth and funding mix continue to perform very well these factors resulted in the margin coming in better than we had expected when we shared our outlook in july we continue to analyze multiple potential interest rate scenarios the basis of our planning and guidance continues to be a central set of those scenarios that is bounded on the low end by the forward yield curve and at the high end by a scenario that projects rates stay higher for longer the higher for longer scenario today assumes one additional rate increase in flat fed funds through october of and ends approximately basis points higher than the forward curve with the move in rates higher we now anticipate net interest margin for the fourth quarter to be around basis points to basis points this is basis points to basis points higher than the level we shared previously looking further out our modeling continues to indicate nim trending flat to higher from the  endpoint huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 turning to slide our cumulative deposit beta through  was up percentage points from the prior quarter tracking closely to our expectations sequential increases in beta are slowing quarteroverquarter as we have forecasted as the interest rate cycle nears or hits its peak as we have noted in the past where beta ultimately tops out will be a function of the end game for the rate cycle in terms of the level and timing of the peak the duration of any extended pause before a decrease given the outlooks for possibly a higher peak and very likely a more extended pause and was the case three months ago our current outlook for deposit beta is to trend a few percentage points higher than our prior guidance of we will have to see how the rate environment plays out into to know with certainty what is critical in our view is to ensure we continue to manage both deposit and loan pricing exceptionally rigorously drive asset yields higher deliver solid incremental returns and deliver a better overall nim from the higher for longer rate environment as a result turning to slide and expanding on my point on loan yields the construct of our balance sheet is approximately half fully variable rate indirect auto which is a shorter approximately twoyear duration fixed product in arms with a fiveyear duration and the remainder of approximately is longer durated fixed this mix contributes to the asset sensitivity of our overall balance sheet and has helped us to benefit significantly from the current rate cycle we are seeing solid increases in fixed asset portfolio yields given the higher for longer rate environment we expect to continue to benefit from this fixed asset repricing going forward supporting the higher nim outlook turning to slide our level of cash and securities was down slightly from the prior quarter as we lowered some of the elevated cash weve been holding in  during  we did not reinvest securities cash flows and the securities balance moved modestly lower as proceeds were held in cash given the attractive shortterm rates were managing the duration of the portfolio lower continuing our management approach since turning to slide our contingent and available liquidity continues to be robust at billion and has grown quarteroverquarter at quarterend this pool of available liquidity represented of total uninsured deposits appear leading coverage turning to slide we continued to be dynamic in adding to our hedging program during the quarter our objectives remain twofold to protect capital and upgrade scenarios and to protect nim in down rate scenarios the most substantive increase was in addition to our forward starting pay fixed swaption strategy which increased by billion during the quarter to billion total this program is intended to protect capital from tail risk in substantive up rate scenarios and once again benefited us as rates moved higher in the quarter we also added billion in collars to support our nim against longerterm down rate scenarios moving on to slide gaap noninterest income increased by million or to million for the third quarter excluding the marktomarket on the pay fixed swaptions fees were relatively stable quarterover quarter on an underlying basis compared to the second quarter we saw increases in deposit service charges including higher paymentrelated treasury management fees this growth was largely offset by lower capital markets fees moving on to slide were seeing encouraging and sustained underlying trends across our three areas of strategic focus for fee revenue growth capital markets which has grown by a cagr over the past six years benefits from a broad set of capabilities bolstered by capstone while has certainly been a challenging environment for capital markets activities in both advisory and several creditdriven products huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 forward pipelines within advisory are solid and we continue to foresee this as a primary contributor to fee revenue growth over the moderate term our payments businesses represent one of the biggest opportunities for both relationship deepening and revenue growth across both treasury management and card categories in wealth management we see a great opportunity to increase the penetration of the offering across our customers leveraging our number one ranking for trust as we grow advisory relationships and drive higher managed assets with recurring revenue streams moving on to slide on expenses gaap noninterest expense increased by million and underlying core expenses increased by million as i mentioned we incurred million of notable item expenses related to the staffing efficiency program and corporate real estate consolidations excluding these items core expense growth compared to the prior quarter was driven by higher personnel occupancy professional services and a set of smaller items within all other expenses we have taken proactive actions throughout the year to support the low level of core underlying expense growth we have delivered in the first half of the year we executed on the voluntary retirement program organizational realignment moving from four revenue segments to two and branch consolidations now in the third quarter were taking another set of incremental actions we are accelerating the implementation of our business process offshoring program and were creating efficiencies throughout the organization with the goal of prioritizing resources toward the largest growth opportunities in the nearterm were also driving incremental saves in our corporate real estate footprint as well as implementing another set of branch consolidations with planned closures early next year these actions demonstrate our commitment to disciplined expense management and will support the continued investment into critical areas of the company to drive longterm value as we manage expenses were balancing both shortterm investment and revenue growth with the longerterm opportunities we know are in front of us slide recaps our capital position reported common equity tier increased to and has increased sequentially for four quarters oci impacts to common equity tier resulted in an adjusted cet1 ratio of our capital management strategy will result in expanding capital while maintaining our top priority to fund high return loan growth were actively managing adjusted cet1 inclusive of aoci and expect to drive that ratio higher over the course of on slide credit quality continues to perform very well with normalization of metrics consistent with our expectations as mentioned net chargeoffs were basis points for the quarter and while higher than last quarter by basis points are tracking to our guidance for full year net chargeoffs between basis points and basis points this level continues to be at the low end of our target through the cycle range for net chargeoffs of basis points to basis points as previously guided given ongoing normalization nonperforming assets increased from the previous quarter and the criticized asset ratio increased with risk rating changes within commercial real estate being the largest component allowance for credit losses is higher by basis points to of total loans and our ecl coverage ratio is amongst the highest in our peer group lets turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter on slide we forecast loan growth of approximately in the fourth quarter which would put full year loan growth at approximately matching the lower end of our prior range deposits are likewise expected to grow in the fourth quarter by approximately core net interest income for the fourth quarter is expected to decline between and from  before expanding throughout from that level noninterest income on a core underlying basis is expected to be relatively stable expenses are expected to increase between and into the fourth quarter primarily driven by revenuerelated expenses associated with the expected growth in capital markets a seasonal increase in medical claims and huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 sustained investment in new and enhanced capabilities we expect net chargeoffs for the full year to be near the midpoint of the basis points to basis points guidance range finally let me close on slide with a few thoughts on our management priorities for were still finalizing our budget for next year and as always we look to share more specific guidance during our january earnings call first and foremost were committed to driving continued capital expansion while we continue to optimize lending growth to drive the highest returns as steve mentioned were playing from a position of strength and we expect to maintain that position as we get ahead of proposed capital regulations and phasein periods related to deposits were continuing to acquire and deepen primary bank customer relationships this should result in continued growth of deposits into next year while supporting our disciplined management of deposit beta given the expected higher for longer rate scenario we will continue to position the balance sheet to remain modestly asset sensitive which will support the margin and we expect will deliver growth and net interest income dollars on a full year basis noninterest income remains a critical focus for us with sustained execution on three primary strategic areas for fee revenue growth capital markets payments and wealth management over the mediumterm we expect that noninterest income has the potential to grow at a rate more quickly than both loans and spread revenues given the opportunities for these fee businesses as i mentioned on expenses we have taken considerable actions to hold baseline expense growth to a low level this focused on sustained efficiencies including operation accelerate business process offshoring and the other actions will yield multiyear benefits these actions are necessary to allow for the continued investment into new and enhanced capabilities which will set up growth over the course of the next few years we expect the net result of these actions for will be an underlying growth rate of core expenses somewhat higher than the level we saw in our current working estimate is underlying expense growth of approximately compared to the approximately level we were running in we believe this level of expense management is the right balance to position the company to operate within the current environment and sustain our momentum into we will also maintain our rigorous approach to credit management consistent with our aggregate moderatetolow risk appetite finally to close we believe we are exceptionally well positioned to proactively stay ahead of the evolving environment we will be dynamic and address these numerous topics head on and over time we believe this will result in opportunities to benefit substantially in the coming years with that we will conclude our prepared remarks and move to qa tim over to you timothy r sedabres executive vice presidentfinance headinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc thanks zach operator we will now take questions we ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related followup and then if that person has additional questions he or she can add themselves back into the queue thank you huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 question and answer section operator thank you at this time well be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you and our first question is from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please proceed with your question manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hi manan manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc can you talk about the puts and takes in that expense growth number for next year what sort of revenue environment is that baked in what are the areas that are pushing up expenses and maybe also where you have flexibility to manage more if the revenue environment is weaker zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah great question and this is zach ill take that one just to indiscernible and set a framework for the answer let me reiterate what i said in the prepared remarks just a minute ago which is driving efficiency in our core expenses is a key priority for us were one of the most efficient banks in the regional banking space and thats been a product of years of efforts i mean what were trying to do right now is strike the balance of the short term and the mediumterm in the shortterm managing expenses to a low level of growth given the overall revenue environment but also in the mediumterm we see significant growth opportunities over time for huntington and we want to make sure that we can maintain that the momentum in our key strategies and in fact capture the higher revenue outlook that we just shared even as we quickly get ahead and stress that work quickly get ahead of the new and expanded risk management capabilities that we need to operate if you take a step back it was just over a year ago that we were fully delivering over billion of annual expenses from the tcf merger over the last year since then we felt underlying core expenses to and we did that with all the programs ive just talked about in prepared remarks the longterm efficiency programs the proactive actions we took in the first quarter of this year and now a new set of actions that were implementing in the third quarter including another tranche of branch optimization accelerating the business process offshoring driving efficiencies across the bank and finding efficiencies in our core real estate portfolio and as we look at the to your question were seeing the opportunity for incremental revenue upside particularly in the really strong performance weve seen in our nim management program which is higher than our prior outlook and good momentum in the key businesses as we look forward huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 we want to quickly address the lessons learned from the last years environment address the new regulations coming around basel ccar resolution planning and ultimately enhance our risk management so we can operate in from a position of strength just as we are right now going forward which will require investment so the kind of things that are driving at roughly higher run rate our investment into teams like treasury risk management technology is where they are focused on enhancing data underlying process capabilities and automation the goal well take a step back is to get ahead of these requirements to quickly move through this period we expect to see around a years worth of this higher expected run rate expenses to get around higher and then that expense growth rate will come back down again as we exit and well see the underlying core expense management come through it all goes back to the goal of maintaining our indiscernible our momentum and really ensuring that huntington continues to be in a position of strength to go forward stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc and this is steve just to sort of coming over the top of that we think this is the time to be dynamic to play off us to be front footed in terms of the number of other businesses and we intend to do that and that will require investment well have more colleagues more talent if you will well have some new capabilities all of which are in the plan and the numbers zach shared with you manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then just putting it together because you mentioned youre modelling nii trends higher as you go through there is more upside to see how does that play into operating leverage for next year do you still think you can drive positive operating leverage zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc its a little indiscernible precise guidance on that but driving toward operating leverage over time is a key element of our goals youll remember that its one of the three major financial targets weve set for ourselves and we do see a solid opportunity for revenue growth next year on both spread and fees but i would stress again coming back whats critical for us is managing for the medium term at this point and we want to make sure that we can maintain those critical investments even as were driving the efficiency during the underlying expense growth rate talk about our operating leverage over time we will have some part of the plan and well have to see the precise outlook for indiscernible manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i appreciate the detailed answers thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you operator the next question is from the line of john pancari with evercore isi please proceed with your question huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning john stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi just on the net interest income front i know you indicated that you implied a you expect a trough in the fourth quarter and then expanding through maybe can you help us frame the magnitude of growth that you think is achievable under the current curve assumption as you look at the nii upside and then i guess the same question would be for your commentary around the margin in terms of expansion through the year maybe if you can help us size that up in terms of whats a fair assumption based on what youre looking at zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah thats a great question this is zach ill take that one now i think just to take a step back and we saw in the third quarter really highlighted the effectiveness of our overall asset sensitivity management program where we saw nim expand and the benefits of after repricing really coming through into a stronger nim what we saw in the third quarter was about basis points increase in nim from the second quarter around half of that i will note are items that were temporary in nature reducing fed cash in  from  to around basis points weve got some elevated levels of dividend from the fhlb stock that was a function of  fhlb borrowing those items wont recur however we did see a positive basis point move in underlying spread in the third quarter as i noted as we think about  our expectation is that well see a nim of between and basis points which is around or basis points better than i would have thought this time last quarter and its really driven by the benefits were seeing coming through from the higher for longer rate scenario which as weve noted we would expect to be accretive to overall nim and that is bearing fruit based on the trend were seeing in earning assets i expect dollars nii in  to be down around to from  and forming a trough both in nim ratio and in net interest income of dollars in the fourth quarter and trending higher from there the nim outlook for i expect to be flat to rising as i noted and i think the things youre going to see are continued really solid progress on a fixed asset repricing major asset categories on the fixed side this quarter is seeing again sequential increases into  expect to see that continuing on particularly in the higher for longer scenario even as we do see beta continuing to trend as well itll be accretive to overall spread throughout the course of next year we think well also benefit as weve noted before during from a gradual reduction in the negative carry from the received fixed swap hedge portfolio we estimate roughly basis points throughout the course of next year on that benefit mainly in the second half of the year so as there are couple of that flat to rising nim with growth in huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 loans growth in the assets that as i know will drive overall nii dollar is higher well get more precise with guidance as we get into january but those are the major drivers that were seeing at this point john pancari q analyst evercore isi very helpful zach thank you for that and then separately on credit criticized loans up linked quarter it looks like and i believe you alluded to it in your comments a lot of that was commercial real estate can you and i know you added to your reserve and commercial real estate nonperformers are also up pretty sharply was there a dedicated effort to scrub the portfolio that you were working through your exposures there that drove a lumpier move here or is this the deterioration thats starting to take shape as we all stacked in this sector richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hey john this is rich let me start with that and then i can turn it over to brendan to give you a little bit more color on what happened in the third quarter so if you think back in  our npa level was at basis points which was the lowest level weve had since the gfc and weve had eight consecutive quarters of declines totaling over million since that the  level that were at today basis points is right around where we were this time last year so to me its not at a level thats concerning to your point around being proactive we have been a lot of the ads to nonaccrual that we had in the quarter were discretionary we have about two thirds of our commercial npls are current on their principal and interest the cre class is a similar story we had reductions in five of the six previous quarters and as you talk about credit normalizing you would expect to see an increase in cre class on front of that so i wouldnt categorize the movements as huge jumps i think its just a normalization of very low levels for us but brendan why dont you give a little bit of insight into the  specifics brendan lawlor a executive vice president deputy chief credit officer huntington bancshares inc sure thanks rich to provide just a little bit more color approximately for cre class approximately of the increase was focused in commercial real estate and our abl group there are two places you expect to see higher levels on the npa side it was split more equally between commercial real estate and ci for both npa and cre class as you noted the real estate exposure was focused mostly in office and on the ci side beyond the abl concentration i mentioned there really werent material concentration so i think what youre seeing in the numbers as rich said is just bounce off the very low bottom john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thank you appreciate the detail operator our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your questions ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc so just maybe a question for you steve i think i mean you all have talked about being frontfooted there are banks that are talking about coming back to loan growth next year but im just wondering if theres going to be a ton of loan demand to speak of for banks to lend into can you just give us a sense of what youre seeing across your footprint where that loan demand is coming from or are you seeing customers get increasingly cautious stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc ebrahim great questions thank you i believe there is a growing cautiousness whats going on in israel and the middle east whats going on in washington weve got a uaw strike that does not have an apparent resolution and i think businesses are reacting to that of our customer base are privately owned companies rates are up theyre using their liquidity but the uncertain economic outlook and where rates are going all sort of are headwinds to the next round of growth having said that our businesses are doing well well have good growth well be within the guidance that we gave you that zach gave you earlier in the will be up about yearoveryear and well continue to see growth next year i believe in a couple of areas in particular our distribution finance is a powerful engine it seasonally reduced this quarter it will be up net in the fourth quarter and we expect to continue to growth that by winning new business we are a significant equipment finance lender and more and more onshoring more automation there will be continued demand albeit probably not at the levels we saw in and before that will play well and were top asset based lender so all of those assetrelated finance activities should do well in this environment and as you know we are a huge small business spend small businesses will need more support and well be there for them and those will be sources of growth but theres an overall more cautious outlook within our customer base just that well have some moderate impact on i think on overall loan demand next year ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thats helpful and i guess a followup zach you mentioned solid increases in fixed asset portfolio yields as they reprice just talk to us in terms of when these are coming up for repricing is it just kind of playing out contractually is there some negotiation in terms of the spreads narrowing at the time of repricing of these fixed rate loans and if thats kind of impacting credit trends are some of these borrowers looking a bit worse in terms of their ability to service the debt postrepricing zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah great questions let me address those so what i say is in terms of the trajectory on asset yield take it back over basis points through the cycle todate and its really been a couple of things most notably the intentional outcome that weve had in terms of how were incrementally driving new loan production into and really driving for higher returns which also is often higher indiscernible so were seeing that come huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 through in a lot of the areas where were actively modulating and optimizing indirect auto for example is a great example that fields up tremendously on the new portfolio course of the cycle its also though just a natural outcome of the structure of the balance sheet and one of the reasons why we added the slide we did i think this quarter in terms of detail there was still just provide more transparency into that were around fully variable and so were seeing the benefits of higher rates come through on that portfolio another roughly in shorter durated fixed indirect auto as i just noted were seeing really excited of all the increases in portfolio there another in arms fiveyear duration which were gradually seeing that come through in the higher for longer scenario every one of those fixed asset categories including the longer durated remaining third of the portfolio are really staying dependent that weve seen just in  basis points increase in the coupon yields across the portfolio greater than basis point increase in back book portfolio yields and i do think that will continue to trend here be one of the key drivers for nim the stability and growth as we go into were not seeing any substantive portfoliowide creditdriven yields and pricing assumptions and really its much more fundamentally driven as i noted stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc ebrahim just to add weve got a very diversified portfolio weve been very disciplined with our aggregate moderate to risk appetite over the years youve seen us report quarterly since on the consumer book which is superprime and auto and resi et cetera so were sitting in a position we feel strengthening the confidence and the portfolio and our ability to manage through even in a tougher cycle and as weve said to our customer base with that relationship orientation were here to support them and we will were positioned to do that with our reserves our capital our robust liquidity and that leads us to this stance of playing offense and moving share during these next couple of years ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you operator the next question is from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your questions r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thanks for taking the call zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 hey zach i just wanted to clarify if i heard correctly is on the nii are we expecting it to grow full year pardon me full year over or just positively off the fourth quarter base zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc well scott great questions happy to clarify both expect to see trajectory of growth out of the year and on a net basis full year growth as well which is going to be a function of flat to rising nims and pretty comparable over our full year and then yearonyear as well as growth in earning assets and loans r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you for that and then wanted to kind of revisit the cost equation a bit maybe on the initiatives that you began in the third quarter maybe just some thoughts on how substantial they are and i guess ultimately i guess the question becomes well have about expense growth despite these initiatives sort of what cost growth might have been without them so just any sort of further thoughts on exactly where were investing what this will ultimately end up driving et cetera zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah terrific question ill let indiscernible expand on that if i think about the equation that were managing in weve been seeing around underlying expense growth and thats with the benefit of significant efficiencies that were generating this year i estimate that sort of around benefit in expenses in from these cumulative initiatives going from last six to months and selffunding underlying investments weve talked about this model before drive efficiencies in the core keeping the underlying core at a low level through the funnel an outsized level of investment and expense growth into key investment areas like tech marketing new additions to personnel to support the strategies that those underlying investments are up almost in which is what i will call the competitive capabilities that weve got as we go into that model its what drove the overall and roughly growth that we saw in i think what were seeing as we go into is roughly similar sort of underlying expense management program we will be modulating down somewhat the underlying investments in light of the environment clearly but also bearing some modest incremental impacts of just the cumulative inflationary environment and the efficiencies will rise as well and so the net kind of underlying run rate that i would have expected into next year was around and then on top of that we are accelerating again these investments in regulatory response risk management capabilities that represent the additional expense as we go into next year thats the trajectory if i think about where were investing indiscernible touch on this briefly continue to focus on core strategy investments delivering the tcf revenue synergies growing our commercial base through vertical specialty specialized specialties expertise digital and product development in our consumer banking and business banking division continue to drive the fee revenue strategies in capital markets payments and wealth and then on top of that clearly dealing with these additional areas around basel iii ccar liquidity and interest rate risk management resolution planning and data indiscernible stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 indiscernible just to add on youll also see several new initiatives that are also included in that number of that well be announcing  and  r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect and i guess just one final tickytack question the fourth quarter cost increase will that include any unusual charges the way we saw this quarter zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc so we saw around million of onetime costs this quarter some portion of onetime costs that we expected to arise as a result of the new initiatives were taking place were not able to be accounted for within the third quarter im expecting roughly million additional onetime expenses in the fourth quarter relative to the same initiatives thats not included in the guidance that i gave earlier indiscernible of things so the total onetimers really for those actions i expect to be approximately million in total of which again weve taken million indiscernible r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect thank you all very much operator our next question is from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed with your question matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so just circling back on capital obviously strong really any ratio you look at and including aoci and i understand the logic of building capital from here given uncertain macro and youre kind of indiscernible the business but is there a level that youre like once we get here its just more than we need under almost any scenario and youd indiscernible to deploy it more aggressively zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yes its a great question let me take a minute to expand on that as you know driving capital higher from here is a key focus we have fully transitioned within the company to managing the primary metric of adjusted cet1 inclusive of aoci and on that basis were at in the third quarter our operating range for cet1 is between and and so we want to drive that ratio up into that operating range of between and and thats the key goal i think by the time we get there i expect that we have significant confidence in being able to huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 do that by the way over time by the time we get there presumably well have clarity on the final basel iii requirements any other implications to capital coming out of the new regulatory environment and well be able to also reassess where the macro environment is and where the lending trajectory so indiscernible and so hard to indiscernible sort of exactly where within that range we want to go but my expectation is once we get into that range therell be an opportunity to get back to a more normalized capital distribution model support elevated and a longerterm run rate levels of loan growth that weve seen in the past and move through it ill just tack on our current working hypothesis and modeling estimate around the basel iii proposal which was adopted exactly as was proposed theres roughly increase in rwa based the phasein schedule that was proposed as part of the npr that wouldnt be phased in until and would represent about bps of cet1 in again as that proposal is written and so part of this is just quickly get ahead of that even far out in time indiscernible far out of time and that really is and allow us to move forward on front foot starting and beyond from an accelerated loan growth perspective matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it that was helpful and then just quickly squeeze in the marktomarket impact of the paycheck swaptions maybe its a silly question but we just kind of put in some gains when rates go up and then if rates go the other way is it marktomarket on the negative side or how should we think about modeling that and the drivers zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah let me expand on that and ill indiscernible question the strategy of those instruments was to protect capital against really substantive operating scenarios when we purchased them they were roughly basis points out of the money weve got about a nine to months of forward life and they would be designed to protect a third to maybe as much as of the securities value of risk in those really substantive about to basis point shock scenarios i think that you put a lot of them on early in the second quarter we added to that portfolio early in the third quarter and weve seen weve spent roughly million in premium indiscernible service in our view a pretty small insurance policy for a very significant benefit in those shock scenarios what weve seen thus far is gains we saw million of gain in  a million of gain in  and a million cumulative gain ill tell you if you were to strike them right now you see another gain into the fourth quarter but clearly they get indiscernible at the very end of the quarter the answer is yes in the nearterm if rates rise you would see a gain in them if rates fall you would see a loss in them the key thought process for us is how critical is that insurance policy to continue to maintain and so versus the gain in them if we continue to hold them i would expect that over time they would expire unused and outofthe money and you would see that gain run back through as a negative through fee income if they indiscernible close it out and we will be dynamic and continue to watch the interest rate outlook with a primary focus on protection of capital at this point again pretty di minimis cash outlay for a really strong insurance policy matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay that makes sense thanks for the details huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah operator our next question is from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your questions ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning steve i know you talked about generally a little bit of softening demand out there but one i wanted to ask to ask you on your auto business i did notice that your originations were up and obviously a lot of peers have pulled away from this business and its a business that you guys have been historically very strong in and now has really good incremental yield just wondering if thats an on opportunity set and have you kind of how do you think through reengaging there as one of those potential growth engines especially as youre indiscernible been able to show that deposit stability thanks stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc ken great question and auto has performed very very well for us we have a confidence in its credit and spreads are very attractive its a cyclical product and in the past weve when spreads have widened weve chosen to do a bit more well be dynamic as we look at this as the interest rate environment clarifies and i think its a short you know its a relatively short asset its roughly a twoyear average duration so we like this asset class a lot and we certainly like it counter cyclically and thatll be something well be looking at closely as we go through to and ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great and then last thing zach just looking at what you moved around a little bit on the swaps portfolio so can you just kind of walk us through some of your decision trees with regards to this this quarters terminations and locking in here and any anticipated future activity youre thinking about in terms of just the book as it stands and going forward thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah absolutely absolutely and i will tell you this is a very dynamic and active discussion its a weekly pretty rigorous data analysis process that we do and its always focused on two key strategies protecting capital against upgrade scenarios and protecting nim against downgrade scenarios as i noted in the prior question around the pay fix swaptions we did have during the quarter to that anticipating that the rates have the strong potential of moving higher and want to protect capital against that and we did a rate in fact indiscernible as you saw clearly and so that benefited us there but whats interesting as well is that the curve has steepened the longer it has come up and as much as it has the opportunity to optimize and take incremental downgrade hedging opportunities in a more efficient manner with less upfront negative carry is increasing i would say as it relates to that our view is still lagging into it no big bets and were seeing very significant benefits that come through in the base asset sensitivity clearly but over the longerterm think of it as a we certainly want to protect those revenue streams and well huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 be seeking opportunities to increase downgrade hedging here if the environment continues to be what it is in the meantime its more of an optimization i would say you saw us exit some receive fixed swaps in  those were mainly shorter durations less efficient structures by indiscernible increased capacity to reup for longer structures we entered in some collars which would give us the option for down rate hedging if rates are attractive out of the future and i do suspect that therell be more of that down rate hedging opportunity as i know like you know as we go indiscernible next year if the curve continues to be the way it should have done ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and is there a way of kind of just putting all that together in terms of like the net impact of the swaps book on your net nii and is that getting better going forward or worse can you just kind of help us put it in context if you can zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yes thats a great question so just zooming into for a second based on the swaps weve got in the portfolio today i do expect were seeing roughly a basis point to basis point drag in currency nim it was bps in  expected to be roughly bps of drag in  of from the overall swaps coming through nim as i noted one of the earlier questions in this hour by i expect that to reduce by about bps particularly second half of the year when the curve starts to fall in the forecast yeah so thats probably the best way to answer your question in the end the goal is to call it a nim really just to support it in this type of range for years to come operator thank you our next question is from the line of erika najarian with ubs please proceed with your question erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning my questions have been asked and answered thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks erika stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thanks erika operator our next question is from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question jon g arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 hey thanks good morning zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning jon jon g arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey richard brendan what whats the message you want to send us on the outlook for provision and reserves i mean it feels like you feel fine on credit but im curious if you feel you need to build reserves and how you want us to think about provision richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah let me start with kind of where we are in the quarter we went up by basis points our coverage ratio theres really a dollar increase we went up million and we put most of that into the commercial real estate reserve just given the uncertainty that we got there where we go from here i mean we dont get specific guidance around the coverage ratio particularly around the provision but its going to depend on where the economy goes to the extent that we see further weakening or reevaluate it but i would imagine that any builds from here would be similar to what you would see in the third quarter fairly nominal from a dollar standpoint it may be moving some things around but in general we feel really good about where the reserve is right now and as we get to the other side of this and the economic outlook starts to improve i could see us bringing the coverage ratio back down into that range over time so well look at it every quarter jon and but we feel good about the right now jon g arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay late in the call steve but just a bigger picture question for you you had a good quarter but when i saw the guide and for the fourth quarter for lower nii and higher expenses and then heard the expense guide for it kind of pulled back some of that optimism i guess my bigger and i think you understand that but my bigger picture question is whats the message for is that is it a year of investment and youre not going to push revenue growth or are we just all being a little bit too pessimistic here and just focusing on the expenses and some of the nearterm nii headwinds stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc zach also talked about improving net interest income and nim at so i dont think of that as and our outlook is not of a negative nature were investing in the businesses were going to do a number of things that i think will position us really well for the mediumterm like in terms of further growth well have some new capabilities and some additional talent in the company well be in a position to manage with data and processes even better as we go forward were accelerating some of our multiyear plans into and as zach said thats the that growth in outlook for expenses in comes back to a more normal level so this is us being intentional positioning the company to play opex and we think were in that position were confident on our credit weve got good and growing capital on both a gross and an adjusted basis liquidity is exceptional the deposit growth continues and as you saw in for those who were out in that period of time there are moments to take advantage and so we launched fair play and as we did a number of things in huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 commercial bank and really opened up sba lending et cetera we think this coming year is one of those moments and we intend to play offense jon g arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay so its okay thats good i had to ask it steve im getting asked that question but i just i just needed to know if youre optimistic or pessimistic for it sounds like youre stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc we are optimistic about and beyond and beyond jon jon g arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right all right stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc okay jon g arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah thank you operator our final question is from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your question steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc steve ive heard all the commentaries for the past hour on expenses and i guess what i still dont understand is is the stepup in expense growth in is that tied to you seeing a better revenue environment to absorb a higher level of spend for something going on thats going to require you to spend more in agnostic for the revenue environment indiscernible stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 so were gearing the company to manage the growth dynamic that we expect will be in place in and beyond we also are accelerating certain multiyear investments into so that were in an even better position with data and its principally data to manage in managing company right were at different scale now postgcf we saw a lot of unique activity in march around silicon valley things move very quickly we want i want and the board wants better data better access to information that we have and pushing the button indiscernible so were weve been on a multiyear journey were going to pull that forward and position the company to be even stronger weve been managing market risk as youve seen with us hedging about half of our afs portfolio since but our processes have not been as automated as we would like them to be given the speed at which things can change and so we said we will take advantage of lessons learned out of silicon valley and others in this most recent episode that has resulted in us making a number of adjustments in our treasury and indiscernible policies that i think will prove to further bolster our aggregate moderates low risk appetite and then these investments in data and some other areas in addition to the revenue area investments will also position us to more effectively manage the company on a realtime basis steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc right it will set the pace of investment is that a story or is that a and beyond story stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc but were trying to pull things forward into as zach said and i think as we think about the and beyond well be back to more normalized again this was an indiscernible part an overall view of trying to take advantage of the environment that we see in and beyond and position the bank for growth i like what we did in indiscernible steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah well it sounds like its partially opportunistic and partially need to invest in systems right sounds like thats a portion of this too stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc we had multiyear plans that were accelerating thats choice steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah okay if i could ask one last question so i dont know if it was bryan of first horizon recently was asked about crossing billion or you really dont want it cross organically right you dont want to be billion but you guys did billion today how do you see this with these proposed changes coming you think youre at a good spot at this level or do you think you need to boost size and scale too just given what just potentially comes thanks huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2023 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc we own the risk and risk management were going to maintain this aggregate moderate to low risk appetite where weve done things well in the past well continue to do them in the future i think the size of the business is not the only determinant i think the business model itself is very very important part of the strategy over time is to be deep in certain markets where our consumer and regional bank giving us brand awareness and other attributes that let us continue to grow the core and then weve invested selectively in a variety of commercial businesses and our asset finance or equipment finance abl the distribution finance a number of these businesses that and beyond the specialty businesses that are national in nature complemented by things that weve added on the payments space last year the acquisition of on the investment banking side all of which give us more products and capabilities to strengthen our customer base and we are going to continue that weve alluded to additional talent and capabilities in the nearterm and what we expect to be in a position to start talking about that but all of thats in that guidance for indiscernible for next year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for taking my questions stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive
