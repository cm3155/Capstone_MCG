item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this mda provides information we believe necessary for understanding our financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations and cash flows the mda should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements notes to consolidated financial statements and other information contained in this report the forwardlooking statements in this section and other parts of this report involve assumptions risks uncertainties and other factors including statements regarding our plans objectives goals strategies and financial performance our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of factors set forth under the caption forwardlooking statements and those set forth in item executive overview acquisitions and divestitures in march huntington completed the sale of the rps business and entered into an ongoing partnership with the purchaser the sale of our rps business resulted in a million gain including associated goodwill allocation recorded within other noninterest income in june huntington completed the acquisition of capstone partners a top tier middle market investment bank and advisory firm the transaction brings a national scale to serve middle market business owners throughout the corporate lifecycle building on huntingtons regional banking foundation capstone partners related revenue including mergers and acquisitions capital raising and other advisoryrelated fees is recognized within capital markets fees in the consolidated statements of income for further information refer to note business combinations of the notes to consolidated financial statements in may huntington completed the acquisition of torana now known as huntington choicepay a digital payments business focused on business to consumer payments this acquisition along with the formation of our enterprisewide payments group reflects one of our strategic priorities to accelerate our payments capabilities and expand the services provided to our customers in june huntington closed the acquisition of tcf financial corporation tcf was a financial holding company headquartered in detroit michigan with operations across the midwest the acquisition brought increased scale and market density as well as added new markets and capabilities our operating results include the impact of tcf subsequent to the acquisition on june for further information refer to note business combinations of the notes to consolidated financial statements reporting updates during the fourth quarter of we updated the presentation of our noninterest income categories to align product and service types more closely with how we strategically manage our business for a description of each updated noninterest income revenue stream refer to note revenue from contracts with customers of the notes to the consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter of we revised our ftp methodology for nonmaturity deposits which has been enhanced to consider the internally modeled weighted average life by nonmaturity deposit type in general the impact of the ftp methodology revision resulted in a higher cost of funds allocation as compared with the previous method to align with our strategic priorities during the second quarter of we completed an organizational realignment and now report on two business segments consumer regional banking and commercial banking the treasury other function includes technology and operations and other unallocated assets liabilities revenue and expense huntingtons business segments are based on our internallyaligned segment leadership structure which is how management monitors results and assesses performance the organizational realignment primarily involved consolidating our previously reported consumer and business banking vehicle finance and rbhpcg into one new business segment called consumer regional banking huntington bancshares incorporated during the second quarter of we revised our process for assessing and monitoring the risk and performance of nonreal estate secured commercial loans primarily loans to reits these loans were reclassified from commercial real estate to the commercial and industrial loan category to align

other consumer loans market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices including the correlation among these factors and their volatility when the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors the holder faces market risk we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers and secondarily to price risk from trading securities securities owned by our brokerdealer subsidiaries foreign exchange positions equity investments and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans we measure market risk exposure via financial simulation models which provide management with insights on the potential impact to net interest income and other key metrics as a result of changes in market interest rates models are used to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of the balance sheet based on assumptions regarding the slope or shape of the yield curve the direction and volatility of interest rates and the changing composition and characteristics of the balance sheet resulting from strategic objectives and customer behavior our models incorporate marketbased assumptions that include the impact of changing interest rates on prepayment rates of assets and runoff of deposits the models also include our projections of the future volume and pricing of various business lines in measuring the financial risks associated with interest rate sensitivity in our balance sheet we compare a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates the market forward rates reflect the market consensus regarding the future level and slope of the yield curve across a range of tenor points the standard set of interest rate scenarios includes two types shock scenarios which are immediate parallel rate shifts and ramp scenarios where the parallel shift is applied gradually over the first months of the forecast on a pro rata basis in both shock and ramp scenarios with falling rates we presume that market rates will not go below the scenarios are inclusive of all executed interest rate risk hedging activities forward starting hedges are included to the extent that they have been transacted and that they start within the measurement horizon a key driver of our interest rate risk profile is our interestbearing deposit repricing sensitivity assumptions to changes in interest rates otherwise known as deposit beta in addition our interest expense is impacted by the composition of both interestbearing and noninterestbearing deposits in relation to our total deposits accordingly we consider the impacts from both interestbearing and noninterest bearing deposits on our total deposit beta our cumulative todate total deposit beta total cost of deposits is within the current rate cycle which started in march interest rate risk is measured across a range of scenarios and the results are reported to the roc at least quarterly a comprehensive discussion of risk management governance can be found in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the risk governance section of this form 10k we use two approaches to model interest rate risk net interest income at risk nii at risk and economic value of equity at risk modeling sensitivity analysis eve at risk nii at risk is used by management to measure the risk and impact to earnings over the next months using a variety of interest rate scenarios the nii at risk results included in the table below reflect the analysis used monthly by management it models gradual ramp and basis point parallel shift scenarios implied by the forward yield curve over the next months huntington bancshares incorporated table start table net interest income at risk december december federal funds rate federal funds rate basis point change

given a gradual parallel ramp relative to the base implied forward scenario the nii at risk shows that the balance sheet is asset sensitive at both december and december the primary drivers to the change in sensitivity during include changes in the projected composition and characteristics of the balance sheet pricing assumptions hedging activity and the evolution of market rates over the next months eve at risk is used by management to measure the impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities including derivative exposures the eve results included in the table below reflect the analysis used monthly by management it models immediate and basis point parallel shock scenarios from the yield curve term points at the specific point in time that eve sensitivity is measured table start table economic value of equity at risk economic value of equity at risk basis point change scenario december december table end the change in sensitivity from december was driven primarily by changes in the composition and characteristics of the balance sheet routine enhancements to deposit and prepayment modeling assumptions changes in hedging activity aligned with interest rate risk positioning through macroeconomic cycles and market rates to address the discontinuance of libor we established a libor transition team and project plan under the oversight of the cro and cfo providing periodic updates to the roc contract remediation efforts coordinated by the libor transition team were complete as of june upon the discontinuation of libor loans and leases that referenced libor were transitioned to a sofrbased replacement rate as set forth in the related contract for further details on the transition of notional derivatives refer to the use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk section below use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk an integral component of our interest rate risk management strategy is the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates examples of derivative instruments that we may use as part of our interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps caps and floors collars forward contracts and forward starting interest rate swaps table shows all swap swaption swaption collar and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing our exposures to the variability of interest rates the interest rates variability may impact either the fair value of the assets and liabilities or impact the cash flows attributable to net interest margin these positions are used to protect the fair value of asset and liabilities by converting the contractual interest rate on a specified amount of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index the positions are also used to hedge the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate by converting the variable rate index into a fixed rate the volume maturity and mix of derivative positions change frequently as we adjust our broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for further information including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives refer to note derivative financial instruments of the notes to

attributable to our investment securities with the change in value of these instruments recorded in other noninterest income we terminated these positions during the fourth quarter cumulatively for the fullyear the net unfavorable marktomarket on the payfixed swaptions program totaled million huntington bancshares incorporated in the second quarter of all cleared derivatives that referenced libor transitioned from libor to a sofrbased replacement rate in accordance with the conventions established by the applicable clearinghouse upon the discontinuation of libor all overthecounter derivatives that referenced libor were transitioned to a sofrbased replacement rate as set forth in the related contract those derivatives that did not have a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate set forth in the related contract used the libor act to replace libor with a sofrbased rate established by frb rulemaking for every libor referenced instrument with a reset date after the libor cessation date counterparties received a libor referenced instrument maturing on the first reset date after the libor cessation date and a forward starting sofr instrument the instruments received through the transition were economically similar to the instruments held prior to the transition use of derivatives to manage credit risk we may utilize credit derivatives as a tool to manage credit risk within the portfolio by purchasing credit protection over certain types of loan products when we purchase credit protection such as a cds we pay a fee to the seller or cds counterparty in return for the right to receive a payment if a specified credit event occurs during the fourth quarter of we completed a synthetic crt transaction consisting of a cds to mitigate credit risk associated with a billion portfolio of onbalance sheet prime indirect auto loans and which benefited our regulatory capital ratios by reducing the rwa on the associated pool of loans by approximately billion msrs this section should be read in conjunction with note mortgage loan sales and servicing rights of notes to consolidated financial statements at december we had a total of million of capitalized msrs representing the right to service billion in mortgage loans msr fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be reduced by prepayments and declines in credit quality prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise we also employ hedging strategies to reduce the risk of msr fair value changes or impairment however volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these economic hedges we report changes in the msr value net of hedgerelated trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income msr assets are included in servicing rights and other intangible assets in the consolidated financial statements price risk price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting we have price risk from trading securities securities owned by our brokerdealer subsidiaries foreign exchange positions derivative instruments and equity investments we have established loss limits on the trading portfolio on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained and on the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held liquidity risk liquidity risk is the possibility of us being unable to meet current and future financial obligations in a timely manner the goal of liquidity management is to ensure adequate stable reliable and costeffective sources of funds to satisfy changes in loan and lease demand unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals investment opportunities and other contractual obligations we consider core earnings strong capital ratios and credit quality essential for maintaining high credit ratings which allows us costeffective access to marketbased liquidity we mitigate liquidity risk by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash cash equivalents and securities in addition we maintain a large stable core deposit base and a diversified base of readily available wholesale funding sources including secured funding sources from the fhlb and federal reserve through pledged borrowing capacity issuance through dealers in the capital markets and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers form 10k the board of directors is responsible for establishing an acceptable level of liquidity risk at huntington including approval of the liquidity risk appetite at least annually the liquidity risk appetite includes certain structural and contingent liquidity risk metrics and limits that are designed and monitored to ensure huntington maintains adequate liquidity to meet current and future funding needs including during periods of potential stress further the alco is appointed by the roc to oversee liquidity risk management including the establishment of liquidity risk policies and additional liquidity risk metrics and limits to support our overall liquidity risk appetite liquidity risk appetite metrics monitored by senior management and reported to the board at least semiannually include loans as a percentage of core deposits a structural funding ratio internal liquidity stress test coverage ratios and a holding company cash coverage ratio additional key liquidity risk metrics monitored by senior management and reported to alco monthly include noncore funds such as brokered deposits and wholesale borrowings as a percentage of tangible assets various deposit concentration limits including large dollar depositor and brokered deposit limits and varying types of internally defined liquidity coverage ratios including minimum reserve balances at the frb and us treasury holdings relative to internal liquidity stress outflows our liquidity risk metric monitoring thresholds are evaluated at a minimum annually and more frequently if conditions warrant liquidity risk is managed centrally by corporate treasury with independent oversight of liquidity risk performed by corporate risk management our liquidity position is evaluated daily weekly and monthly by analyzing the composition of all funding sources reviewing projected liquidity commitments by future months and identifying sources and uses of funds the overall management of our liquidity position is also integrated into consumer and commercial pricing policies to ensure a stable core deposit base liquidity risk is reviewed and managed continuously for the bank and the parent company as well as its subsidiaries in addition liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions provide policy guidance review funding strategies and oversee the adherence to and maintenance of contingency funding plans at december management believes current sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet huntingtons on and offbalance sheet obligations we maintain a contingency funding plan that provides for liquidity stress testing which assesses the potential erosion of funds in the event of an institutionspecific event or systemic financial market crisis examples of institution specific events could include a downgrade in our public credit rating by a rating agency a large charge to earnings declines in profitability or other financial measures declines in liquidity sources including reductions in deposit balances or access to contingent funding sources or a significant merger or acquisition examples of systemic events unrelated to us that could have an effect on our access to liquidity could include terrorism or war natural disasters political events failure of a major financial institution or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources the contingency funding plan which is reviewed and approved by the roc at least annually outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis and provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities and communication protocols for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period and outlines early warning indicators that are used to monitor emerging liquidity stress events our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is core deposits which provide stable and lowercost funding core deposits were billion at december which comprised of total deposits compared to billion and of total deposits at december the billion increase in core deposits compared to december was primarily driven by an increase in consumer deposits largely money market and certificates of deposits partially offset by a decrease in commercial core deposits driven by shifts to offbalance sheet liquidity solutions we provide for our customers our core deposits come from a base of primary bank customer relationships and we continue to focus on acquiring and deepening those relationships resulting in our granular and diversified deposit base noncore deposits consist primarily of brokered money market balances noncore deposits were billion or of total deposits at both december and december noncore deposits were below our established liquidity risk metric limits at december insured deposits comprised approximately of our total deposits

deposits in excess of insurance limit table end cash and cash equivalents were billion and billion at december and december respectively the billion increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to an increase in interestbearing deposits at the federal reserve bank to support shortterm liquidity our investment securities portfolio is evaluated under established alco objectives changing market conditions could affect the profitability of the portfolio as well as the level of interest rate risk exposure total investment securities were billion at december compared to billion at december the million increase in securities compared to december was due to a managed increase in the portfolio through the purchase of us treasuries in addition to an increase in fair market value partially offset by maturities during the year at december the duration of the investment securities portfolio was years or years net of hedging securities are pledged to secure borrowing capacity

wholesale funding totaled billion at december compared to billion at december with the increase primarily due to increases in longterm fhlb borrowings and senior notes partially offset by a decrease in shortterm fhlb borrowings for further information on our shortterm borrowings and longterm debt refer to note borrowings of the notes to consolidated financial statements bank liquidity and sources of funding our primary sources of funding for the bank are consumer and commercial core deposits at december these core deposits funded of total assets of total loans to the extent we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through core deposits and cash and cash equivalents we may meet out liquidity needs through wholesale funding and asset securitization or sale the bank maintains borrowing capacity at both the fhlb and the federal reserve secured by pledged loans and securities the bank does not consider borrowing capacity at the federal reserve a primary source of funding however it could be used as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption at december the banks available contingent borrowing capacity at the fhlb and federal reserve totaled billion compared to billion at december the increase reflects our optimization of contingent borrowing capacity through the pledge of incremental assets the amount of available contingent borrowing capacity may fluctuate based on the level of borrowings outstanding and level of assets pledged huntington bancshares incorporated following the first quarter of bank failures the frb established the btfp as an additional source of available liquidity to support depository institutions through pledging qualifying assets as collateral the bank has taken steps to support readiness

huntingtons board of directors at december we believe the company has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations over the next months and for the foreseeable future offbalance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business we enter into various offbalance sheet arrangements these arrangements include commitments to extend credit interest rate swaps caps and floors swaption collars financial guarantees contained in standby lettersofcredit issued by the bank and commitments by the bank to sell mortgage loans commitments to extend credit commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates are variablerate and contain clauses that permit huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customers credit quality these arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions credit quality probability of funding and other relevant factors since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements the interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly shortterm variablerate nature see note commitments and contingent liabilities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information standby lettersofcredit standby lettersofcredit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a thirdparty these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements including commercial paper bond financing and similar transactions most of these arrangements mature within two years and are expected to expire without being drawn upon standby lettersofcredit are included in the determination of the amount of riskbased capital that the parent

other quantitative methodologies that may not adequately predict future results violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards and external influences such as market conditions fraudulent activities disasters failed business contingency plans and security risks we continuously strive to test and strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with significant contracts agreements laws rules and regulations to reduce our exposure to fraud and to improve the oversight of our operational risk we actively monitor cyberattacks such as attempts related to online deception and loss of sensitive customer data we evaluate internal systems processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyberattacks and to date have not experienced any material losses cybersecurity threats have increased primarily through phishing campaigns we are actively monitoring our email gateways for malicious phishing email campaigns we have also increased our cybersecurity and fraud monitoring activities through the implementation of specific monitoring of remote connections by geography and volume of connections to detect anomalous remote logins since a significant portion of our workforce has the option to work remotely our objective for managing cybersecurity risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of external threat events or other efforts to penetrate our systems we work to achieve this objective by hardening networks and systems against attack and by diligently managing visibility and monitoring controls within our data and communications environment to recognize events and respond before the attacker has the opportunity to plan and execute on its own goals to this end we employ a set of defense indepth strategies which include efforts to make us less attractive as a target and less vulnerable to threats while investing in threat analytic capabilities for rapid detection and response potential concerns related to cybersecurity may be escalated to our boardlevel technology committee as appropriate as a complement to the overall cybersecurity risk management we use a number of internal training methods both formally through mandatory courses and informally through written communications and other updates internal policies and procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks we also use thirdparty services to test the effectiveness of our cybersecurity risk management framework and any such third parties are required to comply with our policies regarding information security and confidentiality form 10k to govern operational risks we have an operational risk committee a legal regulatory and compliance committee a funds movement committee a fraud risk committee an information and technology risk committee and a third party risk management committee the responsibilities of these committees among other duties include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns risks or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues in addition we have a model risk oversight committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise these committees report any significant findings and remediation recommendations to the risk management committee potential concerns may be escalated to our roc and our audit committee as appropriate the goal of this framework is to implement effective operational riskmonitoring minimize operational fraud and legal losses minimize the impact of inadequately designed models and enhance our overall performance compliance risk financial institutions are subject to many laws rules and regulations at both the federal and state levels these broadbased laws rules and regulations include but are not limited to expectations relating to antimoney laundering lending limits client privacy fair lending prohibitions against unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices protections for military members as they enter active duty and community reinvestment the volume and complexity of recent regulatory changes have increased our overall compliance risk as such we utilize various resources to help ensure expectations are met including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws rules and regulations our colleagues receive training for several broadbased laws and regulations including but not limited to antimoney laundering and customer privacy additionally colleagues engaged in lending activities receive training for laws and regulations related to flood disaster protection equal credit opportunity fair

section should be read in conjunction with the regulatory matters section included in part i item business and note other regulatory matters of the notes to consolidated financial statements our primary capital objective is to maintain appropriate levels of capital within our boardapproved risk appetite to support the banks operations absorb unanticipated losses and declines in asset values and provide protection to uninsured depositors and debt holders in the event of liquidation while also funding organic growth and providing appropriate returns to our shareholders both regulatory capital and shareholders equity are managed at the bank and on a consolidated basis we have an active program for managing capital and maintain a comprehensive process for assessing the companys overall capital adequacy including the monitoring and reporting of capital risk metrics to the board and roc that we believe are useful for evaluating capital adequacy and making capital decisions in addition to asreported regulatory capital and tangible common equity metrics which are discussed in more detail below we also actively monitor other measures of capital such as tangible common equity

december we at both the consolidated and bank level maintained basel iii capital ratios in excess of the wellcapitalized standards established by the federal reserve the increase in the consolidated cet1 riskbased capital ratio compared to the prior year was primarily driven by current period earnings and a decrease in riskweighted assets partially offset by dividends the decrease in riskweighted assets was largely driven by the synthetic crt transaction which reduced riskweighted assets by approximately billion with the riskweight moving from to on the selected pool of assets shareholders equity we generate shareholders equity primarily through the retention of earnings net of dividends and share repurchases other potential sources of shareholders equity include issuances of common and preferred stock our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk appetite and risk tolerance objectives to meet both regulatory and market expectations and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and business opportunities shareholders equity totaled billion at december an increase of billion or when compared with december the increase was primarily driven by earnings net of dividends the changing rate environment causing a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss and net issuance of preferred stock the net issuance of preferred stock is reflective of the first quarter of issuance of million of series j perpetual preferred stock partially offset by the fourth quarter of repurchases totaling million of series e perpetual preferred

authorizes share repurchases we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares future stock repurchases may be private or openmarket repurchases including block transactions accelerated or delayed block transactions forward transactions and similar transactions various factors determine the amount and timing of our share repurchases including our capital requirements the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions market conditions including the trading price of our stock and regulatory and legal considerations on january our board authorized the repurchase of up to billion of common shares within the eight quarter period ending december subject to the federal reserves capital regulations purchases of common stock under the authorization may include open market purchases privately negotiated transactions and accelerated share repurchase programs during the year ended december we repurchased no shares of common stock under the current repurchase authorization as part of the capital plan and our current expectation that organic capital will be used for funding loan and lease growth and proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements we do not expect to utilize the share repurchase program through however we may at our discretion resume share repurchases at any time while considering factors including but not limited to capital requirements and market conditions business segment discussion overview huntingtons business segments are based on our internallyaligned segment leadership structure which is how we monitor results and assess performance to align with our strategic priorities during the second quarter of we completed an organizational realignment and now report on two business segments consumer regional banking and commercial banking the treasury other function includes technology and operations and other unallocated assets liabilities revenue and expense the organizational realignment primarily involved consolidating our previously reported consumer and business banking vehicle finance and rbhpcg into one new business segment called consumer regional banking prior period results have been adjusted to conform to the new segment presentation business segment results are determined based upon our management practices which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and accordingly the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions revenue sharing revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations expense allocation the management process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments expenses are allocated to business segments using a twophase approach the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activitybased costs to activities related to product origination and servicing these activitybased costs are then extended based on volumes with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to the business segments from treasury other we utilize a fullallocation methodology where all treasury other expenses except reported acquisitionrelated expenses if any and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses are allocated to the business segments form 10k funds transfer pricing ftp we use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments the intent of the ftp methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing modeled duration funding of assets and liabilities the result is to centralize the financial impact management and reporting of interest rate risk in the treasury other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed the treasury other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment during the fourth quarter of we revised our ftp methodology for nonmaturity deposits which has been enhanced to consider the internally modeled weighted average life by nonmaturity deposit type in general the impact of the ftp methodology revision resulted in a higher cost of funds allocation as compared with the previous method prior period results have been adjusted to conform to the revised ftp methodology net income loss by business segment

equity to tangible assets tangible equity to tangible assets and tangible common equity to riskweighted assets using basel iii definitions these nonregulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions additionally presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare our

the risk factors section included in item risk factors of this report additional information regarding risk factors can also be found in the risk management and capital discussion of this report as well as the regulatory matters section included in item business of this report critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements note significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated by reference into this mda describes the significant accounting policies we used in our consolidated financial statements an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below allowance for credit losses our acl at december represents our current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded lending commitments management estimates the acl by projecting probability of default loss given default and exposure at default conditional on economic parameters for the remaining contractual term internal factors that impact the quarterly allowance estimate include the level of outstanding balances the portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings one of the most significant judgments influencing the acl estimate is the macroeconomic forecasts key external economic parameters that directly impact our loss modeling framework include forecasted unemployment rates and gdp changes in the economic forecasts could significantly affect the estimated credit losses which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within our modeling framework it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the allowance as a result management uses a probabilityweighted approach that incorporates a baseline an adverse and a more favorable economic scenario when formulating the quantitative estimate huntington bancshares incorporated however to illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis management calculated a quantitative allowance using a weighting applied to an adverse scenario this scenario contemplates an increased risk of an extended government shutdown persisting inflation concerns at the federal reserve causing the federal funds rate to remain elevated through the first quarter of ongoing banking industry uncertainty and the tightening of lending standards increased geopolitical tensions between china and taiwan impact the supply chain for semiconductors and the threat of a wider conflict causes consumer confidence to fall additionally the russian invasion of ukraine lasts longer than in the baseline scenario and concerns increase around the hamasisrael conflict leading to a broader war in the middle east the combination of the risk of federal shutdown political tensions tightening lending standards and the federal funds rate remaining elevated cause the stock market to fall the economy falls into a recession in the first quarter of in response to the recession the federal reserve starts lowering the federal funds rate in the second quarter of with significant rate reductions by the end of under this scenario as an example the unemployment rate increases from baseline levels and remains elevated for a prolonged period the rate is estimated at and at the end of and respectively this forecast reflects unemployment rates that are approximately and higher than baseline scenario projections of and respectively for the same time periods to demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters used in the calculation of our acl at december management calculated the difference between our quantitative acl and this adverse scenario excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase in our acl of approximately billion at december this hypothetical increase is reflective of the sensitivity of the rate of change in the unemployment variable on our models the resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in allowance levels for a number of reasons including the following management uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its allowance estimation process the highly uncertain economic environment the difficulty in predicting the interrelationships between the economic parameters used in the various economic scenarios and the sensitivity estimate does not account for any general reserve components and associated risk profile adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall allowance framework we regularly review our acl for appropriateness by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio in doing so we consider factors such as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we also evaluate the impact of changes in key economic parameters and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in our portfolio as economic and market conditions may ultimately differ from our reasonable and supportable forecast additionally events adversely affecting specific customers industries or our markets such as geopolitical instability or risks of inflation including a nearterm recession could severely impact our current expectations if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates or the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the extent to which the geopolitical instability and risks of inflation will continue to negatively impact our businesses financial condition liquidity and results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be forecasted with precision at this time for more information see note loans leases and note allowance for credit losses of the notes to consolidated financial statements form 10k goodwill the acquisition method of accounting requires that assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date the valuation of assets and liabilities often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques all of which are inherently subjective this typically results in goodwill the amount by which the cost of net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds their fair value which is subject to impairment testing at least annually management reviews the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as of october or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value based on our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of october it was determined that the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of its respective carrying value as of october therefore goodwill is considered not impaired huntington additionally performs sensitivity analyses around discount rate assumptions utilized in order to assess the reasonableness of the rates and the resulting estimated fair values as of october a basis point increase in discount rates would reduce estimated entity level fair value by approximately billion and would not result in any impairment as each reporting units fair value would still exceed its carrying value recent accounting pronouncements and developments note accounting standards
