item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this mda provides information we believe necessary for understanding our financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations and cash flows the mda should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements notes to consolidated financial statements and other information contained in this report the forwardlooking statements in this section and other parts of this report involve assumptions risks uncertainties and other factors including statements regarding our plans objectives goals strategies and financial performance our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of factors set forth under the caption forwardlooking statements and those set forth in item executive overview acquisitions in june huntington closed the acquisition of tcf financial corporation historical periods prior to june reflect results of legacy huntington operations subsequent to closing results reflect all postacquisition activity for further information refer to note business

included an billion or increase in average loans and leases and an billion or increase in average securities average balances across earning asset categories reflect organic growth in addition to the late secondquarter tcf acquisition the increase in average securities was additionally driven by the redeployment of excess liquidity into securities in the second half of the nim expansion was driven by the higher rate environment driving an increase in loan and lease and investment security yields partially offset by higher cost of funds and the impact of lower accelerated ppp loan fees recognized upon forgiveness payments from the sba in the provision for credit losses increased million to million primarily due to loan and lease growth and the likelihood of a worsening economic scenario throughout the reduction in acl coverage ratios over the course of reflected more clarity relating to the economic impacts of covid19 the acl was billion or of total loans and leases at december compared to billion or of total loans and leases at december the increase in the total acl was primarily driven by loan and lease growth but also recognizes the increased nearterm recessionary risks at the end of s will result in a chargeoff to estimated collateral value less anticipated selling costs at the time of discharge commercial loans and leases are either chargedoff or written down to net realizable value by 90days past due with the exception of administrative small ticket lease delinquencies automobile loans rv and marine and other consumer loans are generally fully chargedoff at 120days past due firstlien and juniorlien home equity loans are chargedoff to the estimated fair value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs at 150days past due and

reduction in ncos in the ci portfolio consumer chargeoffs were higher in compared to primarily due to an increase in the other consumer portfolio market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices including the correlation among these factors and their volatility when the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors the holder faces market risk we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers and secondarily to price risk from trading securities securities owned by our brokerdealer subsidiaries foreign exchange positions equity investments and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans form 10k we measure market risk exposure via financial simulation models which provide management with insights on the potential impact to net interest income and other key metrics as a result of changes in market interest rates models are used to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of the balance sheet based on assumptions regarding the slope or shape of the yield curve the direction and volatility of interest rates and the changing composition and characteristics of the balance sheet resulting from strategic objectives and customer behavior assumptions and models provide insight on forecasted balance sheet growth and composition and the pricing and maturity characteristics of current and future business in measuring the financial risks associated with interest rate sensitivity in our balance sheet we compare a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates the market forward reflects the market consensus regarding the future level and slope of the yield curve across a range of tenor points the standard set of interest rate scenarios includes two types shock scenarios which are immediate parallel rate shifts and ramp scenarios where the parallel shift is applied gradually over the first months of the forecast on a pro rata basis in both shock and ramp scenarios with falling rates we presume that market rates will not go below the scenarios are inclusive of all executed interest rate risk hedging activities forward starting hedges are included to the extent that they have been transacted and that they start within the measurement horizon interest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the board of directors at least quarterly a comprehensive discussion of risk management governance can be found in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the risk governance section of this form 10k we use two approaches to model interest rate risk net interest income at risk nii at risk and economic value of equity at risk modeling sensitivity analysis eve at risk table start table net interest income at risk net interest income at risk basis point change scenario december december table end the nii at risk results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management it models gradual ramp and basis point parallel shift scenarios implied by the forward yield curve over the next twelve months the nii at risk shows that the balance sheet is asset sensitive at both december and december the change in sensitivity is primarily driven by changes in forecasted market interest rate expectations and the mix of the balance sheet table start table economic value of equity at risk economic value of equity at risk basis point change scenario december december table end the eve results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management it models immediate and basis point parallel shock scenarios the change in sensitivity from december was driven primarily by increases in the yield curve shortening the duration of liabilities change in deposit mix and hedging throughout the year huntington bancshares incorporated as of december huntington had outstanding liborbased instruments that mature after june including loan and lease exposures totaling approximately billion notional derivative exposure totaling approximately billion securities of approximately billion and longterm debt of million to address the discontinuance of libor in its current form we established a libor transition team and project plan under the oversight of the cro and cfo providing periodic updates to the roc contract remediation efforts coordinated by the libor transition team are scheduled for completion by june source systems have been updated to support alternative reference rates at this time alternative reference rates are predominantly sofr based as such we have developed a sofrenabled interest rate risk monitoring framework and a strategy for managing interest rate risk during the transition from libor to sofr we continue to monitor market developments and regulatory updates for a discussion of the risks associated with the libor transition to alternative reference rates refer to item risk factors use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk an integral component of our interest rate risk management strategy is the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates examples of derivative instruments that we may use as part of our interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps caps and floors forward contracts and forward starting interest rate swaps table shows all swap swaption collar and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing our exposures to the variability of interest rates the interest rates variability may impact either the fair value of the assets and liabilities or impact the cash flows attributable to net interest margin these positions are used to protect the fair value of asset and liabilities by converting the contractual interest rate on a specified amount of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index the positions are also used to hedge the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate by converting the variable rate index into a fixed rate the volume maturity and mix of derivative positions change frequently as we adjust our broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for further information including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives

bancshares incorporated msrs this section should be read in conjunction with note mortgage loan sales and servicing rights of notes to consolidated financial statements at december we had a total of million of capitalized msrs representing the right to service billion in mortgage loans msr fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be reduced by prepayments and declines in credit quality prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise we also employ hedging strategies to reduce the risk of msr fair value changes or impairment however volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these economic hedges we report changes in the msr value net of hedgerelated trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income msr assets are included in servicing rights and other intangible assets in the consolidated financial statements price risk price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting we have price risk from trading securities securities owned by our brokerdealer subsidiaries foreign exchange positions derivative instruments and equity investments we have established loss limits on the trading portfolio on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained and on the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held liquidity risk liquidity risk is the possibility of us being unable to meet current and future financial obligations in a timely manner the goal of liquidity management is to ensure adequate stable reliable and costeffective sources of funds to satisfy changes in loan and lease demand unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals investment opportunities and other contractual obligations we consider core earnings strong capital ratios and credit quality essential for maintaining high credit ratings which allows us costeffective access to marketbased liquidity we mitigate liquidity risk by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash deposits at the federal reserve bank and investment securities in addition we maintain a large stable core deposit base and a diversified base of readily available wholesale funding sources including advances from the fhlb through pledged borrowing capacity issuance through dealers in the capital markets and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers the board of directors approves the liquidity strategy and furthermore reviews the acceptable level of liquidity risk policy and procedures established by senior management the alco is appointed by the roc to oversee liquidity risk management and the establishment of liquidity risk policies and limits liquidity risk is managed centrally by corporate treasury our liquidity position is evaluated daily weekly and monthly by analyzing the composition of all funding sources reviewing projected liquidity commitments by future months and identifying sources and uses of funds the overall management of our liquidity position is also integrated into consumer and commercial pricing policies to ensure a stable core deposit base liquidity risk is reviewed and managed continuously for the bank and the parent company as well as its subsidiaries in addition liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions provide policy guidance review funding strategies and oversee the adherence to and maintenance of the contingency funding plans our primary source of liquidity is our core deposit base core deposits comprised approximately of total deposits at december we also have available unused wholesale sources of liquidity liquidity is further provided by unencumbered or unpledged investment securities that totaled billion as of december form 10k the treasury department also maintains a contingency funding plan that provides for liquidity stress testing which assesses the potential erosion of funds in the event of a systemic financial market crisis or institutionalspecific stress scenario an example of an institution specific event would be a downgrade in our public credit rating by a rating agency due to factors such as deterioration in asset quality a large charge to earnings a decline in profitability or other financial measures or a significant merger or acquisition examples of systemic events unrelated to us that could have an effect on our access to liquidity would be terrorism or war natural disasters political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources the contingency funding plan outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities and communication protocols for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period investment securities portfolio this section should be read in conjunction with note investment securities and other securities of the notes to consolidated financial statements our investment securities portfolio is evaluated under established alco objectives changing

securitization or sale sources of wholesale funding include other domestic deposits of or more negotiable cds brokered and other deposits shortterm borrowings and longterm debt our wholesale funding for both the bank and parent company totaled billion at december compared to billion at december the increase from the prior yearend is primarily due to increases in senior debt brokered funds and fhlb borrowings the bank may issue longterm debt pursuant to an authorization from the banks board of directors that allows for the periodic issuance of senior andor subordinated debt securities with fixed or floating interest rates the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities available for issuance is capped by the board authorization and is reviewed periodically for adjustment form 10k

sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations over the next months and for the foreseeable future offbalance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business we enter into various offbalance sheet arrangements these arrangements include commitments to extend credit interest rate swaps caps and floors swaption collars financial guarantees contained in standby lettersofcredit issued by the bank and commitments by the bank to sell mortgage loans commitments to extend credit commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates are variablerate and contain clauses that permit huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customers credit quality these arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions credit quality probability of funding and other relevant factors since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements the interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly shortterm variablerate nature see note commitments and contingent liabilities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more

failed internal systems and controls including the use of financial or other quantitative methodologies that may not adequately predict future results violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards and external influences such as market conditions fraudulent activities disasters failed business contingency plans and security risks we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with significant contracts agreements laws rules and regulations and to improve the oversight of our operational risk we actively monitor cyberattacks such as attempts related to online deception and loss of sensitive customer data we evaluate internal systems processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyberattacks and to date have not experienced any material losses cybersecurity threats have increased primarily through phishing campaigns we are actively monitoring our email gateways for malicious phishing email campaigns we have also increased our cybersecurity and fraud monitoring activities through the implementation of specific monitoring of remote connections by geography and volume of connections to detect anomalous remote logins since a significant portion of our workforce has the option to work remotely our objective for managing cyber security risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of external threat events or other efforts to penetrate our systems we work to achieve this objective by hardening networks and systems against attack and by diligently managing visibility and monitoring controls within our data and communications environment to recognize events and respond before the attacker has the opportunity to plan and execute on its own goals to this end we employ a set of defense indepth strategies which include efforts to make us less attractive as a target and less vulnerable to threats while investing in threat analytic capabilities for rapid detection and response potential concerns related to cyber security may be escalated to our boardlevel technology committee as appropriate as a complement to the overall cyber security risk management we use a number of internal training methods both formally through mandatory courses and informally through written communications and other updates internal policies and procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks we also use thirdparty services to test the effectiveness of our cyber security risk management framework and any such third parties are required to comply with our policies regarding information security and confidentiality huntington bancshares incorporated to govern operational risks we have an operational risk committee a legal regulatory and compliance committee a funds movement committee and a third party risk management committee the responsibilities of these committees among other duties include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns risks or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues in addition we have a model risk oversight committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise these committees report any significant findings and remediation recommendations to the risk management committee potential concerns may be escalated to our roc and our audit committee as appropriate significant findings or issues are escalated by the third party risk management committee to the technology committee of the board as appropriate the goal of this framework is to implement effective operational riskmonitoring minimize operational fraud and legal

and state levels these broadbased laws rules and regulations include but are not limited to expectations relating to antimoney laundering lending limits client privacy fair lending prohibitions against unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices protections for military members as they enter active duty and community reinvestment the volume and complexity of recent regulatory changes have increased our overall compliance risk as such we utilize various resources to help ensure expectations are met including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws rules and regulations our colleagues receive training for several broadbased laws and regulations including but not limited to antimoney laundering and customer privacy additionally

business segment called consumer regional banking this will result in two major business segments consumer regional banking and commercial banking business segment results are determined based upon our management practices which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and

providing service to customers results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations expense allocation the management process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments expenses are allocated to business segments using a twophase approach the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activitybased costs to activities related to product origination and servicing these activitybased costs are then extended based on volumes with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all four business segments from treasury other we utilize a fullallocation methodology where all treasury other expenses except reported acquisitionrelated expenses if any and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses are allocated to the four business segments huntington bancshares incorporated funds transfer pricing ftp we use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments the intent of the ftp methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing modeled duration funding of assets and liabilities the result is to centralize the financial impact management and reporting of interest rate risk in the treasury other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed the treasury other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment the ftp rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets or liabilities net

interest income on an fte basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes the fte basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and taxexempt sources the fte basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of percent we encourage readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this form 10k in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure nonregulatory capital ratios in addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators the company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy including tangible common equity to tangible assets tangible equity to tangible assets and tangible common equity to riskweighted assets using basel iii definitions these nonregulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions additionally presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare our capitalization to other financial services companies these ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes goodwill and other intangible assets the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies these ratios are not defined in gaap or federal banking regulations as a result these nonregulatory capital ratios disclosed by the company are considered nongaap financial measures because there are no standardized definitions for these nonregulatory capital ratios the companys calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies also there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors as a result we encourage readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this form 10k in their

critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements note significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated by reference into this mda describes the significant accounting policies we used in our consolidated financial statements form 10k an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below allowance for credit losses our acl at december represents our current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded lending commitments management estimates the acl by projecting probability of default loss given default and exposure at default conditional on economic parameters for the remaining contractual term internal factors that impact the quarterly allowance estimate include the level of outstanding balances the portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings one of the most significant judgments influencing the acl estimate is the macroeconomic forecasts key external economic parameters that directly impact our loss modeling framework include forecasted unemployment rates and gross domestic product changes in the economic forecasts could significantly affect the estimated credit losses which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within our modeling framework it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the allowance as a result management uses a probabilityweighted approach that incorporates a baseline an adverse and a more favorable economic scenario when formulating the quantitative estimate however to illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis management calculated a quantitative allowance using a weighting applied to an adverse scenario this scenario includes assumptions around opec oil supply cuts being more severe than anticipated and the russian invasion of ukraine worsening and lasting longer than the baseline scenario the worsening inflationary pressures cause the federal reserve to raise interest rates more than in the baseline scenario to a peak of by mid2023 the combination of the worsening invasion higher oil prices rising inflation and the federal reserves response collectively cause the stock market to drop further and the economy falls into a recession in the first quarter of under this scenario as an example the unemployment rate increases from baseline levels and remains elevated for a prolonged period the rate is estimated at and at the end of and respectively this forecast reflects unemployment rates that are approximately and higher than baseline scenario projections of and respectively for the same time periods to demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters used in the calculation of our acl at december management calculated the difference between our quantitative acl and this adverse scenario excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase in our acl of approximately billion at december this hypothetical increase is reflective of the sensitivity of the rate of change in the unemployment variable on our models the resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in allowance levels for a number of reasons including the following management uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its allowance estimation process the highly uncertain economic environment the difficulty in predicting the interrelationships between the economic parameters used in the various economic scenarios and the sensitivity estimate does not account for any general reserve components and associated risk profile adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall allowance framework huntington bancshares incorporated we regularly review our acl for appropriateness by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio in doing so we consider factors such as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we also evaluate the impact of changes in key economic parameters and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in our portfolio as economic and market conditions may ultimately differ from our reasonable and supportable forecast additionally events adversely affecting specific customers industries or our markets such as geopolitical instability risks of inflation including a nearterm recession or the emergence of a more contagious and severe covid19 variant could severely impact our current expectations if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates or the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the extent to which the geopolitical instability risks of inflation and the covid19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact our businesses financial condition liquidity and results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be forecasted with precision at this time for more information see note loans leases and note allowance for credit losses of the notes to consolidated financial statements fair value measurement certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis including securities and derivative instruments a majority of assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are based on quoted market prices or market prices for similar instruments assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis or that result in a level measurement in the fair value hierarchy inherently include subjectivity and may require the use of significant assumptions adjustments and judgment including among others discount rates rates of return on assets cash flows default rates loss rates terminal values and liquidation values a significant change in assumptions may result in a significant change in fair value which in turn may result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility and could result in significant impact on our results of operations financial condition or disclosures of fair value information while all nonrecurring and level fair value measurements inherently have a significant level of estimation uncertainty the following items are those most likely to have a material impact on our financial statements acquired loans and leases when huntington acquires loans and leases through an acquisition those loans are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date this requires significant assumptions to be made about credit quality likelihood of prepayment and current market conditions for similar loans these assumptions form the basis for establishing discount rates and projecting future cash flows used to estimate the acquired loans fair value management generally will utilize a thirdparty specialist when these valuations are significant and as a result will perform various sensitivity analysis to determine the significance of specific inputs into the valuation direct purchase municipal securities huntington holds certain municipal securities purchased directly from the issuer in nonpublic offerings as a result these securities use unobservable inputs to estimate fair value each period management utilizes a thirdparty valuation specialist to assist in determining certain assumptions used in the valuation and projecting future cash flows used to estimate fair value of the securities management reviews the valuations including understanding how sensitive the valuation is to specific inputs the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy additional discussion regarding fair value measurements and a brief description of how fair value is determined for categories that have unobservable inputs can be found in note fair value of assets and liabilities of the notes to consolidated financial statements form 10k goodwill the acquisition method of accounting requires that assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date the valuation of assets and liabilities often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques all of which are inherently subjective this typically results in goodwill the amount by which the cost of net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds their fair value which is subject to impairment testing at least annually management reviews the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as of october or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value based on our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of october it was determined that the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of its respective carrying value as of october therefore goodwill is considered not impaired huntington additionally performs sensitivity analyses around discount rate assumptions utilized in order to assess the reasonableness of the rates and the resulting estimated fair values as of october a basis point increase in discount rates would reduce estimated entity level fair value by approximately billion and would not result in any impairment as each reporting units fair value would still exceed its carrying value recent accounting pronouncements and developments note accounting standards update of the notes to consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting
