mda should also be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and other information contained in this report our definition philosophy and approach to risk management have not materially changed from the discussion presented in the annual report on form 10k credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending we also have credit risk associated with our investment securities portfolios see note investment securities and other securities of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements we engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing asset and liability management mortgage banking and trading activities a variety of derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps caps and floors are used in asset and liability management activities to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements we also use derivatives principally loan sale commitments in hedging our mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held for sale while there is credit risk associated with derivative activity we believe this exposure is minimal we focus on the early identification monitoring and management of all aspects of our credit risk in addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes market risk management activities and portfolio diversification we use quantitative measurement capabilities utilizing external data sources enhanced modeling technology and internal stress testing processes our ongoing expansion of portfolio management resources is central to our commitment to maintaining an aggregate moderatetolow throughthecycle risk appetite in our efforts to identify risk mitigation techniques we have focused on product design features origination policies and solutions

section should be read in conjunction with note loans leases and note allowance for credit losses of the notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements we believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance is through an analysis of specific performance ratios this approach forms the basis of the discussion in the sections immediately following npas nals

quality performance in the second quarter reflected ncos of million or of average total loans and leases annualized a decrease of million compared to million or in the yearago quarter the decrease was

our acl is comprised of two different components both of which in our judgment are appropriate to absorb lifetime expected credit losses in our loan and lease portfolio the alll and the aulc we use statisticallybased models that employ assumptions about current and future economic conditions throughout the contractual life of the loan the process of estimating expected credit losses is based on three key parameters pd ead and lgd beyond the reasonable and supportable period two to three years the economic variables revert to a historical equilibrium at a pace dependent on the state of the economy reflected within the economic scenario huntington bancshares incorporated future economic conditions consider multiple macroeconomic scenarios provided to us by an independent third party and are reviewed through the appropriate committee governance channels described below these macroeconomic scenarios contain certain variables that are influential to our modeling process the most significant being unemployment rates and gdp the probability weights assigned to each scenario are generally expected to be consistent from period to period and determined through our acl process any changes in probability weights must be supported by appropriate documentation and approval of senior management additionally we consider whether to adjust the modeled estimates to address possible limitations within the models or factors not captured within the macroeconomic scenarios lifetime losses for most of our loans and leases are evaluated collectively based on similar risk characteristics risk ratings origination credit bureau scores delinquency status and remaining months within loan agreements among other factors the baseline scenario used for the second quarter assumes that the russian invasion will not spread beyond ukraine and the resulting disruptions to the oil natural gas and other commodity markets will be limited and temporary the overnight federal funds rate is forecast to average in fourth quarter as the federal reserve looks to address the rising inflation this rate is expected to peak at prior to the expectation that the fed would start to cut rates in late the table below is intended to show how the forecasted path of unemployment rate and gdp has changed since the end of table forecasted key macroeconomic variables baseline scenario forecast      unemployment rate na na gross domestic product na na values reflect the baseline scenario forecast inputs for each period presented not updated for subsequent actual amounts management continues to assess the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment including those related to geopolitical instability and current inflation levels considering multiple macroeconomic forecasts that reflected a range of possible outcomes in order to address such uncertainty while we have incorporated estimates of economic uncertainty into our acl the ultimate impact the current inflation levels and attempts to lower inflation through federal reserve rate actions will have on the economy remains uncertain management develops additional analytics to support adjustments to our modeled results our governance committees reviewed model results of each economic scenario for appropriate usage concluding that the quantitative transactional reserve will continue to utilize scenario weighting given the uncertainty associated with key economic scenario assumptions the june acl included a general reserve that consists of various risk profile components including profiles related to the potential economic impact of a nearterm recession as the federal reserve raises interest rates attempting to lower inflation and the commercial real estate portfolio to capture uncertainty not addressed within the quantitative transaction reserve our acl methodology committee is responsible for developing the methodology assumptions and estimates used in the calculation as well as determining the appropriateness of the acl the alll represents the estimate of lifetime expected losses in the loan and lease portfolio at the reported date the loss modeling process uses an ead concept to calculate total expected losses on both funded balances and unfunded lending commitments where appropriate losses related to the unfunded lending commitments are then recorded as aulc within other liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet a liability for expected credit losses for offbalance sheet credit exposures is recognized if huntington has a present contractual obligation to extend the credit and the obligation is not unconditionally cancelable form 10q the aulc is determined by applying the same quantitative reserve determination process to the unfunded portion of the loan exposures adjusted by an applicable funding expectation see note significant accounting policies of the notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements

management processes market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices including the correlation among these factors and their volatility when the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors the holder faces market risk we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers and secondarily to price risk from trading securities securities owned by our brokerdealer subsidiaries foreign exchange positions equity investments and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans huntington bancshares incorporated we measure market risk exposure via financial simulation models which provide management with insights on the potential impact to net interest income and other key metrics as a result of changes in market interest rates models are used to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of the balance sheet based on assumptions regarding the slope or shape of the yield curve the direction and volatility of interest rates and the changing composition and characteristics of the balance sheet resulting from strategic objectives and customer behavior assumptions and models provide insight on forecasted balance sheet growth and composition and the pricing and maturity characteristics of current and future business in measuring the financial risks associated with interest rate sensitivity in our balance sheet we compare a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates the market forward reflects the market consensus regarding the future level and slope of the yield curve across a range of tenor points the standard set of interest rate scenarios includes two types shock scenarios which are immediate parallel rate shifts and ramp scenarios where the parallel shift is applied gradually over the first months of the forecast on a pro rata basis in both shock and ramp scenarios with falling rates we presume that market rates will not go below the scenarios are inclusive of all executed interest rate risk hedging activities forward starting hedges are included to the extent that they have been transacted and that they start within the measurement horizon we use two approaches to model interest rate risk net interest income at risk nii at risk and economic value of equity at risk modeling sensitivity analysis eve at risk table net interest income at risk net interest income at risk basis point change scenario june december the nii at risk results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management it models gradual ramp and basis point parallel shift scenarios implied by the forward yield curve over the next twelve months as well as an immediate parallel shock scenario of basis points the nii at risk shows that the balance sheet is asset sensitive at both june and december the change in sensitivity is primarily driven by changes in market interest rate expectations and the size and mix of the balance sheet table economic value of equity at risk economic value of equity at risk basis point change scenario june december the eve results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management it models immediate and basis point parallel shock scenarios as of june eve at risk sensitivities have increased since december the change in sensitivity from december was driven primarily by changes in the spot market rate curve extending the duration of the securities portfolio and shortening the duration of liabilities we have liborbased exposure in the form of variable rate loans derivatives series b preferred stock long term debt and other securities and financial arrangements to address the discontinuance of libor in its current form we established a libor transition team and project plan under the oversight of the cro and cfo providing periodic updates to the roc as of december huntington ceased issuance of new libor loans contract remediation efforts coordinated by the libor transition team are scheduled for completion by june source systems have been updated to support alternative reference rates at this time alternative reference rates are predominantly sofr based as such we have developed a sofrenabled interest rate risk monitoring framework and a strategy for managing interest rate risk during the transition from libor to sofr we continue to monitor market developments and legislative and regulatory updates form 10q use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk an integral component of our interest rate risk management strategy is the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates examples of derivative instruments that we may use as part of our interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps caps and floors collars forward contracts and forward starting interest rate swaps table shows all swap collar and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing our exposures to the variability of interest rates the interest rates variability may impact either the fair value of the assets and liabilities or impact the cash flows attributable to net interest margin these positions are used to protect the fair value of asset and liabilities by converting the contractual interest rate on a specified amount of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index the positions are also used to hedge the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate by converting the variable rate index into a fixed rate the volume maturity and mix of derivative positions change frequently as we adjust our broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for further information including the

the right to service billion in mortgage loans msr fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be reduced by prepayments and declines in credit quality prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise we also employ hedging strategies to reduce the risk of msr fair value changes or impairment however volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these

at june the carrying value of investment securities pledged to secure public and trust deposits trading account liabilities us treasury demand notes and security repurchase agreements and to support borrowing capacity totaled billion there were no securities of a single issuer which are not governmental or governmentsponsored that exceeded of shareholders equity at june to the extent we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through core deposits we may meet our liquidity needs through sources of wholesale funding asset securitization or sale sources of wholesale funding include other domestic deposits of or more negotiable cds brokered and other deposits shortterm borrowings and longterm debt our wholesale funding for both the bank and parent company totaled billion at june compared to billion at december the increase from yearend is primarily due to issuances of shortterm fhlb advances and senior debt partially offset by repayment of maturing debt instruments at june we believe the bank has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations over the next months and for the foreseeable future huntington bancshares incorporated parent company liquidity the parent companys funding requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders debt service income taxes operating expenses funding of nonbank subsidiaries repurchases of our stock

cash flow obligations over the next months and for the foreseeable future offbalance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business we enter into various offbalance sheet arrangements these arrangements include commitments to extend credit interest rate swaps caps and floors collars financial guarantees contained in standby lettersofcredit issued by the bank and commitments by the bank to sell mortgage loans operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error thirdparty performance failures inadequate or failed internal systems and controls including the use of financial or other quantitative methodologies that may not adequately predict future results violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards and external influences such as market conditions fraudulent activities disasters failed business contingency plans and security risks we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with significant contracts agreements laws rules and regulations and to improve the oversight of our operational risk we actively monitor cyberattacks such as attempts related to online deception and loss of sensitive customer data we evaluate internal systems processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyberattacks and to date have not experienced any material losses cybersecurity threats have increased primarily through phishing campaigns we are actively monitoring our email gateways for malicious phishing email campaigns we have also increased our cybersecurity and fraud monitoring activities through the implementation of specific monitoring of remote connections by geography and volume of connections to detect anomalous remote logins since a significant portion of our workforce has the option to work remotely form 10q our objective for managing cyber security risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of external threat events or other efforts to penetrate our systems we work to achieve this objective by hardening networks and systems against attack and by diligently managing visibility and monitoring controls within our data and communications environment to recognize events and respond before the attacker has the opportunity to plan and execute on its own goals to this end we employ a set of defense indepth strategies which include efforts to make us less attractive as a target and less vulnerable to threats while investing in threat analytic capabilities for rapid detection and response potential concerns related to cyber security may be escalated to our boardlevel technology committee as appropriate as a complement to the overall cyber security risk management we use a number of internal training methods both formally through mandatory courses and informally through written communications and other updates internal policies and procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks we also use thirdparty services to test the effectiveness of our cyber security risk management framework and any such third parties are required to comply with our policies regarding information security and confidentiality to govern operational risks we have an operational risk committee a legal regulatory and compliance committee a funds movement committee and a third party risk management committee the responsibilities of these committees among other duties include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns risks or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues in addition we have a model risk oversight committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise these committees report any significant findings and remediation recommendations to the risk management committee potential concerns may be escalated to our roc and our audit committee as appropriate significant findings or issues are escalated by the third party risk management committee to the technology committee of the board as appropriate the goal of this framework is to implement effective operational riskmonitoring minimize operational fraud and legal losses minimize the impact of inadequately designed models and enhance our overall performance compliance risk financial institutions are subject to many laws rules and regulations at both the federal and state levels these broadbased laws rules and regulations include but are not limited to expectations relating to antimoney laundering lending limits client privacy fair lending prohibitions against unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices protections for military members as they enter active duty and community reinvestment the volume and complexity of recent regulatory changes have increased our overall compliance risk as such we utilize various resources to help ensure expectations are met including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws rules and regulations our colleagues receive training for several broadbased laws and regulations including but not limited to antimoney laundering and customer privacy additionally colleagues engaged in lending activities receive training for laws and regulations related to flood disaster protection equal credit opportunity fair lending andor other courses related to the extension of credit we hold ourselves to a high standard for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance capital we consider disciplined capital management as a key objective both regulatory capital and shareholders equity are managed at the bank and on a consolidated basis we have an active program for managing capital and maintain a comprehensive process for assessing our overall capital adequacy we believe our current levels of both regulatory

change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting cecl as of june we have phased in of the cumulative cecl deferral with the remaining impact to be recognized over the remainder of the threeyear transition period at june we maintained basel iii capital ratios in excess of the wellcapitalized standards established by the frb th e decrease i n regulatory capital ratios was primarily driven by riskweighted asset growth and goodwill recognized during the quarter partially offset by earnings shareholders equity we generate shareholders equity primarily through the retention of earnings net of dividends and share repurchases other potential sources of shareholders equity include issuances of common and preferred stock our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk appetite and risk tolerance objectives to meet both regulatory and market expectations and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and business opportunities shareholders equity totaled billion at june a decrease of billion or when compared with december the decrease was primarily driven by higher interest rates causing a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income partially offset by earnings net of dividends huntington is authorized to make capital distributions that are consistent with the requirements in the frbs capital rule inclusive

huntington private client group rbhpcg the treasury other function includes technology and operations other unallocated assets liabilities revenue and expense business segment results are determined based upon our management practices which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and accordingly the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions revenue sharing revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations expense allocation the management process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments expenses are allocated to business segments using a twophase approach the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activitybased costs to activities related to product origination and servicing these activitybased costs are then extended based on volumes with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all four business segments from treasury other we utilize a fullallocation methodology where all treasury other expenses except reported acquisitionrelated expenses if any and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses are allocated to the four business segments funds transfer pricing ftp we use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments the intent of the ftp methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing modeled duration funding of assets and liabilities the result is to centralize the financial impact management and reporting of interest rate risk in the treasury other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed the treasury other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment

financial measure can be found herein fullytaxable equivalent basis interest income yields and ratios on a fte basis are considered nongaap financial measures management believes net interest income on a fte basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes the fte basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and taxexempt sources the fte basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of percent we encourage readers to consider the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this form 10q in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure nonregulatory capital ratios in addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators the company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy including tangible common equity to tangible assets tangible equity to tangible assets and tangible common equity to riskweighted assets using basel iii definitions these nonregulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions additionally presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare our capitalization to other financial services companies these ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes goodwill and other intangible assets the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies these ratios are not defined in gaap or federal banking regulations as a result these nonregulatory capital ratios disclosed by the company are considered nongaap financial measures form 10q because there are no standardized definitions for these nonregulatory capital ratios the companys calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies also there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors as a result we encourage readers to consider the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this form 10q in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10k as supplemented by this report including this mda describes the significant accounting policies we used in our consolidated financial statements an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed in our annual report on form 10k as supplemented by this report including this mda allowance for credit losses our acl at june represents our current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded lending commitments management estimates the acl by projecting probability of default loss given default and exposure at default conditional on economic parameters for the remaining contractual term internal factors that impact the quarterly allowance estimate include the level of outstanding balances the portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings one of the most significant judgments influencing the acl estimate is the macroeconomic forecasts key external economic parameters that directly impact our loss modeling framework include forecasted footprint unemployment rates and gross domestic product changes in the economic forecasts could significantly affect the estimated credit losses which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within our modeling framework it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the allowance as a result management uses a probabilityweighted approach that incorporates a baseline an adverse and a more favorable economic scenario when formulating the quantitative estimate however to illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis management calculated a quantitative allowance using a weighting applied to an adverse scenario this scenario includes assumptions around the russian invasion of ukraine worsening and lasting longer than the baseline scenario import bans on russian oil lead to additional price increases contributing to higher inflation rates that are also exacerbated by the continuing supply chain disruption additionally the federal reserve continues to raise rates through the first half of to fight inflation even as the economy heads into a recession in the third quarter under this scenario as an example the unemployment rate increases from baseline levels and remains elevated for a prolonged period the rate is estimated at and at the end of and respectively these numbers result in unemployment rates that are approximately and higher than baseline scenario projections of and respectively for the same time periods to demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters used in the calculation of our acl at june management calculated the difference between our quantitative acl and this adverse scenario excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase in our acl of approximately million at june this hypothetical increase is reflective of the sensitivity of the rate of change in the unemployment variable on our models huntington bancshares incorporated the resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in allowance levels for a number of reasons including the following management uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its allowance estimation process the highly uncertain economic environment the difficulty in predicting the interrelationships between the economic parameters used in the various economic scenarios and the sensitivity estimate does not account for any general reserve components and associated risk profile adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall allowance framework we regularly review our acl for appropriateness by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio in doing so we consider factors such as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we also evaluate the impact of changes in key economic parameters and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in our portfolio as economic and market conditions may ultimately differ from our reasonable and supportable forecast additionally events adversely affecting specific customers industries or our markets such as geopolitical instability risks of rising inflation including a nearterm recession or the emergence of a more contagious and severe covid19 variant could severely impact our current expectations if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates or the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the extent to which the geopolitical instability risks of rising inflation and the covid19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact our businesses financial condition liquidity and results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be forecasted with precision at this time for more information see note loans and leases and note allowance for credit losses of the notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements fair value measurement certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis including securities and derivative instruments assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently include subjectivity and may require the use of significant assumptions adjustments and judgment including among others discount rates rates of return on assets cash flows default rates loss rates terminal values and liquidation values a significant change in assumptions may result in a significant change in fair value which in turn may result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility and could result in significant impact on our results of operations financial condition or disclosures of fair value information the fair value hierarchy requires use of observable inputs first and subsequently unobservable inputs when observable inputs are not available our fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models which involve inputs that are observable level or level in fair value hierarchy when available the level of judgment required to determine fair value is dependent on the methods or techniques used in the process assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets level do not require significant judgment while the valuation of assets and liabilities when quoted market prices are not available levels and may require significant judgment to assess whether observable or unobservable inputs for those assets and liabilities provide reasonable determination of fair value the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy additional discussion regarding fair value measurements and a brief description of how fair value is determined for categories that have unobservable inputs can be found in note fair values of assets and liabilities of the notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements form 10q goodwill and other intangible assets the acquisition method of accounting requires that assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date the valuation of assets and liabilities often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques all of which are inherently subjective this typically results in goodwill the amount by which the cost of net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds their fair value which is subject to impairment testing at least annually the amortization of identified intangible assets recognized in a business combination is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received over their economic life which is also subjective customer attrition rates that are based on historical experience are used to determine the estimated economic life of certain intangibles assets including but not limited to

loans substandard inadequately protected loans resulting from the borrowers ability to repay equity andor the collateral pledged to secure the loan these loans have identified weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or collection of the debt it is likely huntington will sustain some loss if any identified weaknesses are not mitigated doubtful loans that have all of the weaknesses inherent in those loans classified as substandard with the added elements of the full collection of the loan is improbable and that the possibility of loss is high loans are generally assigned a category of pass rating upon initial approval and subsequently updated as appropriate based on the borrowers financial performance commercial loans categorized as olem substandard or doubtful are considered criticized loans commercial loans categorized as substandard or doubtful are both considered classified loans for all classes within the consumer loan portfolios loans are assigned pool level pd factors based on the fico range within which the borrowers credit bureau score falls a credit bureau score is a credit score developed by fico based on data provided by the credit bureaus the credit bureau score is widely accepted as the standard measure of consumer credit risk used by lenders regulators rating agencies and consumers the higher the credit bureau score the higher likelihood of repayment and therefore an indicator of higher credit quality huntington assesses the risk in the loan portfolio by utilizing numerous risk characteristics the classifications described above and also

dollar amounts in millions june december contract amount representing credit risk commitments to extend credit commercial consumer commercial real estate standby letters of credit and guarantees on industrial revenue bonds commercial letters of credit commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates are variablerate and contain clauses that permit huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customers credit quality these arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions credit quality probability of funding and other relevant factors since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements the interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly shortterm variablerate nature collateral to secure any funding of these commitments predominately consists of residential and commercial real estate mortgage loans standby lettersofcredit and guarantees on industrial revenue bonds are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a thirdparty these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements including commercial paper bond financing and similar transactions most of these arrangements mature within two years since the conditions under which huntington is required to

maturities of no longer than days the goods or cargo being traded normally secure these instruments litigation and regulatory matters in the ordinary course of business huntington is routinely a defendant in or party to pending and threatened legal and regulatory actions and proceedings in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties huntington generally cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be or what the eventual loss fines or penalties related to each matter may be huntington establishes an accrued liability when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable in such cases there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued huntington thereafter continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established huntington bancshares incorporated for certain matters huntington is able to estimate a range of possible loss in cases in which huntington possesses information to estimate a range of possible loss that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below there may be other matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but such an estimate of the range of possible loss may not be possible for those matters where an estimate of the range of possible loss is possible management currently estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss is to million at june in excess of the accrued liability if any related to those matters this estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties the matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate the estimated range of possible loss does not represent huntingtons maximum loss exposure based on current knowledge management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of huntington further management believes that amounts accrued are adequate to address huntingtons contingent liabilities however in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters some of which are beyond huntingtons control and the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to huntingtons results of operations for any particular reporting period segment reporting huntingtons business segments are based on our internallyaligned segment leadership structure
