quarter earnings call joining me on the call today is dale gibbons and tim bruckner our chief financial officer and chief credit officer i will first provide an overview of our quarterly results and how we are managing the business in this current economic environment and then dale will walk you through the banks financial performance afterwards we will open the lines to take your questions in western alliance broke many of our own records for balance sheet growth net interest income and earnings all the while fortifying our balance sheet position our strategy to align the company with strong borrowers nationwide provided us the strength and flexibility to navigate the economic volatility as we grew our balance sheet and income while simultaneously managing asset quality despite external challenges financially was a strong year and was our 11th consecutive on rising earnings for the year we produced record net revenues of billion net income of million and eps of greater than despite increasing the provision expense by million our focus continues to be on ppnr growth which rose approximately to million and net interest income increased million or while total expenses increased to modest million to put this in perspective revenue expanded more than times the rate of expenses in a difficult uneven and complex operating environment given all of these actions tangible book value per share grew yearoveryear to turning to the fourth quarter results we achieved a record million in net income and eps of for the quarter an increase of from prior year these results benefit from a 342million reversal credit loss provision consistent with our strong asset quality results and improved goforward consensus economic outlook outstanding quarterly loan and deposit growth of billion and billion respectively lifted total assets to billion which was driven by broad based growth throughout our business lines and geographies as clients begin to plan their investment for future opportunities additionally several of our internal business initiatives gained traction for the full year loans increased billion excluding ppp program or and deposits grew a record shattering billion which we believe creates a strong foundation for ongoing loan and earnings growth as the economy continues to heal from covid shutdowns this balance sheet growth propelled net interest income decline to million for the quarter or on a yearoveryear basis quarterly nim was up basis points on the third quarter as ppp income improved and cost cd cost fell fee income increased to million for the quarter aided by million of equity and warranty income on a full year basis fee income grew a healthy to billion full year operating noninterest expense grew million to million producing an efficiency ratio of in the fourth quarter our efficiency ratio improved to as revenue growth was times noninterest expense growth and continues to provide incremental flexibility to grow ppnr asset quality continued to improve this quarter as our covid remediation strategy produced increasingly positive results for our clients total classified assets declined million in  to basis points of total assets which was lower than  levels on both on relative and absolute dollar amount just as the pandemic impact was being felt at quarter end total deferrals had fallen to million or basis points of total loans including million for low ltv residential loans as of today there are less than million of deferrals excluding the residential portfolio and all of our hotel franchise finance loans are paying as agreed these noticeably positive credit trends the improved consensus economic outlook and loan growth the low risk asset prices drove our 342million lease loan loss reserves this quarter dale will go into more detail on specific western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 drivers of our provision but our total loan acl to funded loan ratio excluding ppp loans now stands at or million and total loan acl to total classified assets is charge offs were million in  and full year charge offs were basis points of loans our robust ppnr generation continues to drive strong capital levels with a cet1 ratio of supporting yearoveryear loan growth return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity were basis points and respectively we remain one of the most profitable banks in the industry as we demonstrated throughout we will continue to support our clients and are encouraged by their participation in ppp program and the second round is rolling out we have begun processing applications and are seeing steady volumes but given the size and constraints and other factors we dont expect the total amount to rise to the levels we saw in round one finally and most importantly all of our accomplishments cannot be achieved without the immense efforts made by the people of western alliance to success excuse me to successfully respond to the challenging covid19 environment which has strongly positioned and prepared the company for whatever may come our way as we enter we take pride in our peer leading performance in good times but above all during the challenging moments dale will now take you through our financial performance dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation thanks ken for the quarter western alliance generated net income of million or eps each up more than on a linkedquarter basis as mentioned net income benefited from a release of provision expense of million primarily driven by improvement in the economic outlook during the quarter in loan growth and lower risk asset classes net interest income grew million during the quarter to million an increase of quarterover quarter and significantly above q2s performance as to which we guided noninterest income increased million to million from the prior quarter supported by a 51million of warrant gains related to our technology lending noninterest expense increased million mainly driven by an increase in incentive accruals and so our fourth quarter performance exceeded the original budget targets which were established pre pandemic continued balance sheet growth generating superior net interest income drove preprovision net revenue of million up yearoveryear and up substantially from the first and third quarters of as the second quarter benefited from onetime items of ppp loan fee recognition and bank owned life insurance restructuring for the year western alliance generated record net income of million or per share an increase over full year even when considering elevated provision expense of million for the year net interest income grew million during the year to billion an increase of yearoveryear mainly attributable to increased loan balances ppp loan fees and a reduction in interest expense noninterest income increased million to million from the prior year we recognized the onetime benefit of a boli restructuring during  of million finally noninterest expenses increased million or just yearoveryear as increases in shortterm incentive accruals and technology costs were offset by lower deposit costs western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 turning now to our net interest drivers investment yields decreased basis points from the prior quarter to and fell basis points from the prior year due to a lower rate environment on a linkedquarter basis loan yields rose basis points following increased yields across most loan types mainly driven by a changing loan mix and higher ppp yield related to prepayment assumptions on forgivable amounts ppp yield for the quarter was compared to for the third quarter interestbearing deposit costs were reduced by basis points in  to basis points with an end of the quarter spot rate of basis points as higher cost cds roll off spot rate for total deposits which includes noninterest bearing deposits was basis points we expect funding costs have essentially stabilized at these levels however there could be marginal benefits as higher cost cds continue to mature and are in place at lower rates current spot rates indicate a relatively stable margin as we enter some decline in loan yield is expected as the mix is changed to lower risk segments with regards to our asset sensitivity our rate risk profile has declined notably since the beginning of with of our loans now behaving as fixed due to floors for variable rate loans and mix shift towards fixed rate residential loans we continue to be asymmetrically positioned to benefit from any future rate increases with an estimated increase in net interest income of from a basis point rate increase in a parallel shock scenario versus a contraction in net interest income if rates fell and flat lined at as ken mentioned this year we demonstrated our ability to grow net interest income by yearoveryear despite the transition to a substantially lower rate environment net interest income increased million or during the quarter as net interest margin increased to the margin benefited from both a trueup related to ppp fee recognition favorable deposit mix shift and improved deposit rates as mentioned earlier during the fourth quarter our extraordinary deposit growth and build in liquidity continues to weigh on the margin and had a negative impact of basis points this quarter adjusting for this the margin would have been slightly above the guidance we gave during the last quarterly call ppp loans increased our nim during  by basis points as we trued up from changes to prepayment assumptions made during  resulting in a ppp loan yield of notice the gold line on the bar chart showing nim excluding volatility related to ppp nim was for  and essentially flat from the third quarter average excess liquidity relative to loans increased million in the quarter the majority of which is held at the frb earning minimal returns which reduced nim by approximately basis points in aggregate given our healthy loan pipeline and ability to deploy these funds to higher yielding earning assets we expect margin drag to dissipate in coming quarters referring to the chart on the lowerleft section of the page of the million in total ppp loan fees net of origination costs million was recognized in the fourth quarter we recognized the reversal of ppp loan fees in the third quarter of million and expect fee recognition to be approximately million in  and taper off as prepayments and forgiveness are realized as the second round of ppp is just underway these fee accretion assumptions only apply to the initial round of funding turning now to efficiency our efficiency ratio improved to in  as the increase in expenses was outweighed by revenue growth and only rose from the fourth quarter of excluding ppp net loan fees and interest the efficiency ratio for the quarter would have been and as we indicated last quarter should be returning to historical levels in the low western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 preprovision net revenue increased million or from the prior quarter and from the same period last year this resulted in preprovision net revenue roa of for the quarter an increase of basis points from  and equal to the yearago period this strong performance in capital generation provides us significant flexibility to fund ongoing balance sheet growth capital management actions or meet credit demands from our clients our strong balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans increased billion net of million of ppp loan payoffs to billion and deposit growth of billion brought our deposit balance to billion at yearend inclusive of ppp loans grew yearoveryear while deposits grew approximately yearoveryear with our focus on low loss loan segments and dda loan to deposit ratio decreased from in  as our strong liquidity position continues to provide us with balance sheet capacity to meet funding needs as deposit growth continues to outpace loan origination our cash position remains elevated at billion at yearend however we believe it provides us inventory for selective credit growth as demand resumes finally tangible book value per share increased over the prior quarter to with an increase of or over the prior year our strong loan growth is a direct result of our flexible business model which combines national commercial banking relationships with our regional footprint and enables thoughtful growth throughout economic cycles the vast majority of the billion in growth was driven by increases in ci loans of million supplemented by cre nonowner occupied loans of million residential and consumer loans now comprise of our loan portfolio while construction loan concentration increased modestly to of total loans within the ci growth for the quarter and highlighting our focus on lowrisk assets capital call lines grew million mortgage warehouse lines grew million and corporate finance loans decreased to million this quarter residential loan originations added million to balances by quarter end net of refinance activity we continue to believe our ability to profitably grow deposits as both the key differentiator and a core value driver to our firms longterm value creation notably yearoveryear deposit growth of million is more than double the annual deposit growth of any previous calendar year deposits grew billion or in the fourth quarter driven by increases in savings and money market of billion interestbearing dda of million and non interest bearing dda of million which comprises of our deposit base robust activity in tech and innovation and market share gains in mortgage warehouse continue to be significant drivers of deposit growth during the quarter additionally one of our deposit initiatives that is fully online contributed over billion in deposit growth in looking at asset quality total classified assets decreased million in  due to credit upgrades payoffs and refinance activity away from wal our nonperforming loans and oreo ratio decreased to basis points to total assets until the classified assets fell to basis points of total assets at yearend which was below the ratio at the end of special mention loans decreased million during the quarter to of funded loans as weve discussed before special mention loans are a result of our credit mitigation strategy to early identify elevate and apply heightened monitoring to loans or segments impacted by the current covid environment and fluctuate as credit migrates in and out we do not see a risk of material losses coming from these credits western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 regarding loan deferrals as ken mentioned as of today we have less than million of deferrals excluding approximately million in low ltv residential loans with an upgraded average loantovalue under all of our hotel franchise finance loans are paying as agreed and our sophisticated hotel sponsors continued to confirm support with our budget net credit losses of million or basis points of average loans were recognized during the quarter compared to million in  our loan allowance for credit losses decreased million from the prior quarter to million due to improvement in economic forecasts and loan growth and portfolio segments with low expected loss rate in all the total acl to funded loans declined basis points to or when excluding ppp loans on a more granular level our low loss asset classes account for approximately of our portfolio and include mortgage warehouse residential and hoa lending capital call lines public finance and resort lending when excluding these components the acl to funded loans on the remainder of the portfolio is we continue to generate significant capital and maintain strong regulatory capital ratios with common equity tangible assets of and a common equity tier ratio of a decrease of basis points during the quarter due to our strong loan growth inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment of per share our tangible book value per share rose in the quarter to an increase of in the past year we continue to grow our tangible book value per share rapidly as it increased three times that of the peer group for the past six years i will hand the call back over to ken kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation thanks dale we believe that our fourth quarter performance was the baseline for future balance sheet and earnings growth building off the robust growth we had in the fourth quarter our pipelines are strong and we expect loan to deposit growth of million to million for the next several quarters both loans and deposits each have their own cyclical and seasonal behavior that are not aligned on a quarterly basis as dale mentioned given our deposit growth and liquidity build we expect there to be some downward pressure on nim related to mix changes and the deployment of liquidity into attractive asset classes additionally we will continue to see nim influence on a quarterly basis by the wave of ppp loans being forgiven and the second round of ppp loans coming on line strong ppnr growth will continue with balance sheet momentum will drive higher net interest income which more than offset the planned increase in noninterest expense looking ahead we will continue to invest in new product offerings and infrastructure to maintain operational efficiency which will eventually push our efficiency ratio back to sustainable levels in the low our longterm asset quality and loan loss reserves are informed by the economic indiscernible forecast which is consistent going forward could imply a steady reserve ratio depending on the timing and pace of the recovery there could be some long migration into the special mention category but we do not expect material migrations into substandard we believe that the provisions in excess of chargeoffs since the pandemic began are more than sufficient to cover chargeoffs through the cycle as we do not see any indicators that imply material losses are on the horizon western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 finally wal is one of the most prolific capital generators in the industry our strong capital base and access to ample liquidity will allow us to take advantage of any market dislocations and any raising risk adjusted returns and to address any future credit demands all while maintaining flexibility to improve shareholder returns at this time dale tim and i are happy to take your questions question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from brad milsaps with piper sandler your line is open brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey guys how are you doing kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation good brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co dale just wanted to maybe kind of focus in on the margin and the balance sheet it sounds like youre going to be able to mostly fund the growth that you expect this year with continued deposit growth would you anticipate with the liquidity that you have continuing to add to the bottom portfolio and then just as a follow up to that it did look like the loan fees exppp were maybe higher than normal this quarter could you address that have you found a new loan category that might generate more fees or is that something that might be considered abnormal dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yes so again as you probably saw we did increase bond purchases in the fourth quarter i think that that is going to continue were under on loan to deposit ratio were certainly comfortable with that climbing im not sure thats going to happen as the deposit pipeline continues to look fairly strong to us certainly so if thats the case so i think we do want to deploy some of this capital weve been sitting on a large chunk of cash it hasnt been all negative although the returns were getting are quite nominal i mean the yields has back up a little bit so id rather start extending now in terms of investments rather than maybe last fall when it was difficult to even reach on a residential mortgage backed securities from a gse in terms of the loan fees yeah youre right brad that number even excluding ppp was elevated in the fourth quarter and im going to call that essentially but nonrecurring we just had some things that paid off that helped that number you can kind of see that if you look at the note rate versus the average rate for the loan book and then its a little bit lower at the end of the year than it was for the fourth quarter western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 thats reflected in there that the yield was a little bit higher so that will be a little bit lower in loan fees kind of going forward excluding ppp that said ppp could be up here as you know as were just getting started on round two brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great thats helpful and then final question for me and ill hop back into queue just around the hotel portfolio i think you both said that its paying as agreed you dont have any deferrals in that category should we understand that as its paying as agreed under the terms of your plus or plus program or are all of these operators all of your institutional borrowers actually making new pi payments that they didnt put up as escrow initially kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation brad the deferral programs are completed so these guys are paying as agreed under the original terms were seeing good sponsorship and commitment to these properties and as tim bruckner always tells me our sponsors at least feel they can see the end of this issue coming with the vaccine being released and being implemented so its their impression and ours as well that this wont be going on for too much longer and thats what makes them feel comfortable to continue to support the properties plus as you know weve got a very good loanto value here and theres a lot of equity sitting in front of us brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co but would you be able to say kind of what percentage of the properties are supporting themselves with their own cash flow without the sponsor support can you define it that way kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation id say how ill define it overall our october or november occupancy was about or and i would say that im trying to think of the best way to give you that answer i would say about twothirds of our hotel book had occupancies over operating expenses so when you think about it if you go back a year the breakeven point was at occupancy level today the still holds but whats changed is the revpar has come down dramatically but operators have been able to cut out their expenses in order to generate the cash flow to offset their operating expenses they havent fully yet gotten to the point where they can cover debt service coverage brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great very helpful thank you guys very much operator your next question comes from michael young with truist securities your line is open michael young q analyst truist securities inc western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 hey thanks for the question wanted to follow up real quick on brads question on kind of the hotel book and maybe even tack on the casino book as well and just kind of an update in light of the second round of ppp i assume most of those operators will be eligible and so that will give them a nice capital and cash infusion as well that wont be as dependent on the sponsors is that fair kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation well the first time around we probably put out between million and million of ppp loans a lot of the hotels dont get the cash flow from ppp because theyve got separate management companies away from the hotels that manage them so i wouldnt expect that the amount of ppp funding thats going to go to the hotel group will be less than round one and also theres a cap on the amount of dollars thats being distributed no greater than million tim do you want to add anything timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorporation i would add yeah and well follow with gaming we underwrite sponsorship as much as we underwrite the hotel or when we underwrite our hotel book so as ken mentioned million on the first round not a big taker of ppp for two reasons one because of the strength of sponsorship and two because the ppp follows the payroll and the structure of the hotel loans usually have that at the management company so we dont expect a big taker we also are in such frequent and ongoing dialogue that we dont see the inability of sponsorship to carry were very confident in that ongoing sponsorship and the relationship that we have there with respect to gaming our gaming again is off strip so most of our gaming wont qualify for ppp because theyve got revenue gains not revenue reduction so the gaming portfolio has really moved out of the spotlight in terms of concern because of the strong performance that weve seen kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah i would categorize it as tim said off strip of the casinos are open for business the portfolio demonstrated the ability to operate at breakeven cash flow or better in these times the majority are outperforming their precovid revenue and cash flow plan so when you think about that statement why would they be doing that theres no place else for people to go and these casinos are open plus theyve received funds from the government that they have a little excess cash or they havent spent a lot of the cash so it represents a form of entertainment and just to reemphasize what tim said this portfolio does not represent an outsized risk or concern for us at this time michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay thats really helpful color and maybe just touching on the growth side the million to million you called out can you maybe peel back the onion on that a bit and just give us a little color on what youre seeing today in particular with mortgage warehouse potentially being a pressure on a yearoveryear basis was that guidance kind of on held for investment loans or does that include the warehouse et cetera western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah so first thing ill say is million to million is a little bit higher than what we said in the previous quarters which was million to million so i would note that i would tell you during the course of the year for we had a lot of growth come in our capital call business and that was over million warehouse lending this is traditional warehouse lending yearoveryear grew by billion but note financing grew by million all the bank regions collectively grew by millionplus and our resi grew by million followed by tech and innovation growing million and even our resort lending grew yearoveryear million so thats sort of perspective backwards as we think about forward for in that number we have little to no growth coming out of traditional warehouse lending were assuming that it just holds its position at yearend predominantly now if were surprised we want to be surprised on the upside but we didnt build a lot of that opportunity yet and i just went through the fullyear results for you can see that a lot of that would come forward into and as dale like to always remind folks our pressure valve is around residential loans and we could always turn that knob up a little bit and bring in more residential loans if we need to weve got a lot of runway ahead of us to be anywhere close to what a traditional bank would have in terms of a percentage of residential loans to total loans michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay thats helpful ill step back operator your next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning thanks for the question dale the bogey that youre talking about or efficiency ratio im interested in kind of the details on that looking at this years results expense growth was quite remarkably low given the growth at are you kind of telegraphing that expenses are going to reaccelerate a bit next year or these are more of a revenue component im just trying to get a sense of that line in the sand dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation well im certainly optimistic about revenues i think theyre going to be strong i think were going to have strong loan growth again as weve discussed a minute ago perhaps some more deployment into securities that will pick up yield from whats in cash right now but the expense side there is going to be some catchup element so just a couple of things that held back expenses our travel expenses were down by more than twothirds we think there is a benefit to actually getting on the road meeting with clients and as we get past this i think thats going to pick up maybe in the second and third quarter and probably no later than that theres other costs related to that we didnt have our management conference this year thats something that will come into play in as well western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 so theres costs related to pandemic that were suppressed in we also have investments that we continue to need to make in risk management in it infrastructure we expect to continue to do that those were maybe put on a slower path of growth for we expect those are probably going to reaccelerate to some degree so yes i do think our numbers are going to be its going to be to the four instead of a three its going to be a low certainly and the revenue is going to be right there with it so were going to be seeing a significant increase in earnings per share revenue growth in dollars will be more than double certainly of what were doing in terms of expense growth in dollars kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation chris i just want to add were sitting at billion now of total assets and when we hit billion or as we hit billion our risk management practices have to continue to evolve so we need to start spending money today our growth rate has been far greater than i think we even thought and so we need to hire some folks to maintain that growth rate on the operational side as well and as dale said its artificially depressed that thats just not a sustainable level to continue to invest in the infrastructure and technology needed to grow and of course theres always some new business development in terms of new business lines that we like that are always embedded in that line as well so again weve got the revenue coverage to exceed the expense growth and next year you can look for us to be back in the low christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and if i could just one more on the margin just want to make sure i got the messaging so if we look through in the deposit and liquidity build like a lot of your peers are experiencing thats going to put pressure and then you talked about the loan fees is the right way to think about just core margin excluding ppp adding modest pressure or did you i cant remember indiscernible i think i heard two different things dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation so yeah its really ppp i think theres modest pressure because i think weve even in the fourth quarter weve had loan risk into these lower risk and hence lower yielding categories and so thats put a little pressure on it on the loan fees that we had in the fourth quarter excluding away from ppp were a little bit elevated from some pay offs that we had and so once you have a loan pay off early all the loan fees that have been deferred are brought back in and so that added a little bit to the fourth quarter number as well which i dont necessarily anticipate continuing so im not going to call that a big number but its got to have a little pressure in terms of the number itself again what were focused on is net interest income and ppnr growth i mean hey we could have pushed away some of this deposit growth that we had in the fourth quarter but because it would have that obviously damages our nim we think thats a good problem to have i like to be able to take those dollars i know theres liquidity abundance within the industry today our view is that it isnt always going to be the case and we want to be able to have the resources have the inventory that we can lend out and sustain a superior growth trajectory over our peers western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation chris i just want to give you an incremental perspective everyone talks about nim and theyve sort of divorce sometimes from our credit quality and i think whats important to know is that weve got a number of business lines capital call warehouse lending note financing msr lending residential loans resource financing muni and nonprofit when you look at what our fourth quarter balances are you add up the collective sum of those areas we have billion of balances that have never had a loss attached to them sorry let me correct myself theyve had one loss for several years ago but basically have never had a loss attached to them and thats of our total loan base so when you think about nim i think its also important to think about risk adjusted nim thats the way i think about it that yeah nim shrinks a little bit thats okay in the sense that were going to still be getting good strong growth which is going to go to dales net interest income comment but also were not going to see a increase in provisioning based upon the growth in these subsectors that i just mentioned christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great i appreciate all the color kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation its one of the reasons why we only add million of net losses this quarter christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc awesome thanks a lot operator operator instructions your next question comes from timur braziler with wells fargo your line is open timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning everyone kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation good morning timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc looking at the addition of galton just wondering what that contribution was in the fourth quarter and in your comments about just maintaining warehouse balances as those new relationships come on how should we be thinking about just kind of building out those existing relationships not necessarily taking market share in context with your flat guide for next year western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation its kind of funny as i was talking to the head of that area the other day i said hey lets go lets review galton in case i get a question about it he assured me that there would be no question about galton because its not big enough and i said hey everyones going to be interested so let me just tell you whats going on there the integration is going well all right we had to sign up their existing customers onto our platform and we had to go through that legal and id say formal process the other thing we have to do is roll out our prequalified approach which means we had to roll out a pricing engine and roll out a credit engine and a lot of thats going to be fully completed by the end of the quarter as we go into  so have we gotten some volume from galton yes have we gotten the buying that we expect no not yet we see the pipeline building and i think its going to have more of an impact in q it will have more of an impact in  than it will have in  and remember they come with different clients and theres only a crossover or overlapping with our existing base timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay understood thank you and then im not sure how easy this would be to answer but warrant gains obviously very strong this quarter i know theyre kind of spotty when you look historically but as youre looking at the strength youre seeing in the capital call line business and just in the tech ecosystem generally speaking is there a gauge for what the pipeline looks on some of the income from the equity investments or is that still going to be up and down every single quarter kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation its going to be up and down its very hard for us to determine that what i can tell you is with the increase in liquidity in the tech and innovation space some of thats come for us in terms of loans have fallen but the onset of the loans falling are the fact that were getting these equity gains so were happy that we always have it built into our loan docs we dont get any equity gains around the capital call lines and as ive said very hard for us to forecast those gains timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc and from a lending standpoint in that business obviously theres many new competitors that are also seeing great growth and success in that line is there enough for everybody or are you starting to see some of the better credits and relationships get more competitive as more lenders step into the space kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation theres a little more competition because there are more competitors but many of them like to go either into were in stage if you will our stage early development stag you have some maturities yeah you see the revenues growing the product has been proven or the service has been proven but they are still spending a lot more money and marketing in order to drive up revenue and drive up their brand recognition name recognition and then stage theyre getting ready to do some type of things either an ipo or some type of strategic sale western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 so some of the players that are in stage dont really compete with us because were not in stage and theyre looking at it in terms of exit fees and those would be the larger banks we dont play there some of the banks playing in the early stage and thats not where we have our skill set so were in the middle stage and yes theres a little more competition but its i would say were not were not losing a lot of business were going after it were winning that business and were winning it on service timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you for the color ken operator your next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning guys kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation good morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey a couple of quick questions can you just touch on the change in segment reporting i know its not a big deal but kind of help us understand whats different and what changes and why you did that and the reporting lines or anything else changed dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah so well a couple of things so our segments were a bit unique relative to other institutions and i think maybe perhaps it conveyed to some degree that we were an assimilation of a commercial business lines put together and i think that maybe did not appropriately convey that actually we have a lot of interdependencies among these enterprises among these businesses that we focus on that we think have kind of superior growth and asset quality metrics and so some of them are consumers have liquidity others are certainly providers of liquidity and i think that the new structure reflects that better that its more of a holistic enterprise in terms of what were being able to accomplish with these business lines that weve selected out to have expertise in the other another thing is if you look at where the industry is this is much more closely aligns with it we had almost the most number of segments of any institution out there now were going to three thats pretty much in line and even i think jpmorgan has four or five so i think it looks better like that the other thing as well is we have consumer related segment and i think historically i think people have thought about us is really primarily just a commercial enterprise but we do have a lot of consumer dependencies in our balance sheet and what were doing i think this highlights that better as well its how were really managing the company and how we think about it western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah more consumer adjacent right jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay just one other i have a different question but one other thing on that what else is in consumer loan balances im assuming mortgages there but what else would be captured in there dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation so yeah mortgages are in there balances related to our hoa balances related to our resort finance kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation resort finance warehouse lending dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah mortgage warehouse indiscernible jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay good tim maybe one for you on reserves i think i hear the message on youre probably set and were not going to see more reserve releases from here but can you talk a little bit about some of your economic forecast when you cut it off and whether you expect to see some improvement over the next couple of quarters in some of the qualitative pieces of your reserve building timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorporation sure okay so we look at reserves as kind of really the convergence of portfolio composition our behavior in remediating and then whats happening in the economy so with the economy weve seen the prognosticators really come a lot closer together over the last quarter so we talk about consensus the consensus view aligning generally to a consensus view thats become easier to do as weve progressed we have a consensus outlook or we shape to align with the consensus outlook when we look at our reserves then we get into the composition of our portfolio and really separate into nearterm and longerterm risk and so the things in this economy right now that have been pressed with nearterm risk we just dont have that much of the small business lending the point of retail and restaurant small business lending its not much that we do and then when we look at our behaviors we look at the stuff that is potentially undersecured things that are cash flow dependent and look at we started remediating that in february so we brought that balance down from million of what was substandard to million at yearend so when we look at it we look at it and say what is going to be impacted and then we test that against our lgd the macro drivers are very favorable based on our portfolio composition western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation i want to take the chance to bring this up jon and just go a little off your question but driving home back to the provisioning and really kind of talk about how we see next year for a moment and ill wrap the provision in so  we are in as we think about going forward into if you take out the reversal of million and you look towards the third quarter when we added about million and you normalize for that going forward and taken on an aftertax basis and then normalize for the increase in ppp income for  it gets you to about run rate right and if you do your times that gets you to just a little under and we kind of gave you that same math last quarter when we were on the and we annualized it we got to so thats how were moving the business forward based on that with a viewpoint that we will be increasing our provisions next year but as tim said if the economic forecast improves or as we said in our prepared remarks if the economic forecast improves or if we continue to grow our growth is stronger in those low to no risk segments or lost segments you can see that provision coming down and that would add to the eps numbers i just mentioned so i want that it connect provision going forward to what we think is our baseline set of numbers as we come out of into so i hope thats a little more color for you guys and gives you a sense of where the company is going jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc i mean ken im stunned because those are the questions we dance around and try to not ask directly because we never get the answer so thats very helpful kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation well then i did a terrible job i wont give you that answer again jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc we appreciate it thanks for everything guys i appreciate it kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation okay operator your next question comes from michael young with truist securities your line is open michael young q analyst truist securities inc hey thanks for taking the quick follow up just big picture kind of question on the hotel franchise book given kind of what weve gone through and i guess were not quite on the back end of this yet but its looking like it may perform well youve probably broadened your relationships et cetera is this going to be a growth portfolio western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 coming out of the pandemic or do you need to keep it out of the certain size of the institution go forward et cetera et cetera just kind of your updated thoughts kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation well its not going to be growth gone wild in the hotel book ill say since the early part of when the pandemic took hold weve only done five maybe six hotel loans those hotel purchases were done by our borrowers away from us they purchased more distressed properties probably at discounted prices of up to and then weve structured it in such a way that our ltvs are no greater than so up to a reduction weve lowered our ltvs and weve strengthened the terms and conditions and weve continued to get the same price so if we see deals like that those are very very strong deals and if theyre in the top primary msa primary or sorry i should say top msas in primary and secondary locations that we like well continue to do that but right now the hotel sponsors and operators are there theyre waiting theyre a little cautious and they havent put their foot down on the pedal yet they want to see their volumes come back before they extend themselves and theyre also waiting to see if they could pick up any distressed deals we havent sold any of our notes or anything like that our clients havent sold any of their properties that were financing as distressed but so i guess im saying its still a little hard for us to handicap but we are financing properties when they meet the criteria of being bought at a discount and we can do it at a lower ltv and i should also say that theyre coming on a lower ltv and theyre putting off a years worth of operating reserves and a years worth of principal and interest here so were getting those programs way up front and because of that we like still doing the financing very strong in terms of underwriting michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay thats helpful i appreciate the updated thoughts operator your next question comes from tim coffey with janney your line is open timothy coffey q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thank you good morning gentlemen ken i want to follow up on the discussion about the bridge bank subsidiary because you that company is in a unique part of that ecosystem the industry out there is booming right now and so from the deposit growth standpoint how much are you counting on that company or the business for deposit growth this next year kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation so the tech and innovation side generates usually to times loan growth so yes were first of all were counting on all our areas to generate both deposit and loan growth no one gets through a budget process with us without getting their working on their balance sheet but last year the tech and innovation did nearly billion of deposit growth and there was a lot of cash that was flushed into that business western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22jan2021 i dont think were going to see as much come in this year so i wouldnt expect as much on the tech and innovation but tech and innovation like science i expect for them to contribute in terms of next years deposit growth and also some of our new business initiatives should continue deposit initiatives still continue to contribute we had a great quarter in from one of our new business initiatives thus far timothy coffey q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay all right and then my other question was on capital management how are you looking at managing capital levels right now kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation well our growth is real strong and so our capital generation is supporting our balance sheet growth so thats the first and simplest answer we are theres been a lot more deal conversation that were seeing that has come across our desk were a little bit more interested in the deal conversation that is around possibly new products or new initiatives new products for us or new niches or that we could somehow enhance and grow so we do see some of those opportunities none of them have fit our model so as ive said the capital generation has been used to support our balance sheet growth timothy coffey q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay all right great those are my questions thank you for your time kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation thanks operator and there are no further questions queued up at this time ill turn the call back over to ken vecchione for closing remarks kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah thanks everyone for joining we feel very good about the quarter we had and onto and well talk to you in days again thank you all operator this concludes todays
