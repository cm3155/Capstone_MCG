bruckner i will first provide an overview of western alliances response to the coronavirus pandemic then dale will walk you through the bank financial performance afterwards we will open the line to take your questions ill begin by laying out western alliances approach to the covid and economic crisis first and most importantly i hope that everyone on the line is doing well and that your families and loved ones are safe and healthy these wishes are especially extended to all the care and safety workers actively putting themselves in harms way to protect our communities at western alliance bank our people remain healthy and engaged and despite the vast majority working from home for the last month continue to go above and beyond the call of duty to serve our customers and the communities we operate to navigate this challenging time our business continuity plans have been working as anticipated and i am proud of the entrepreneurial spirit our people continue to demonstrate to get the job done and develop unique solutions for our clients first id like to lay out the business actions western alliance has taken in light of the evolving environment although we did not anticipate the widespread severity and likely duration of the virus we did start assessing potential risk and mitigants as early as midjanuary and as the breadth of the pandemic became apparent we accelerated implementing plans in midfebruary to prioritize asset quality capital and liquidity management western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 we have since divided the business into appropriate risk segments led by senior managers with deep credit and workout experience to monitor and foster earlier engagement with all borrowers and begin the necessary credit triage process for example robert sarver is leading the hotel franchise group while i am leading the warehouse lending and gaming groups dale has corporate finance and tim bruckner coordinates overseas and directs all credit activities our overall risk management approach is focused on establishing individual borrower level strategies in which we are proactively engaging in customer conversations to evaluate and agree upon financial plans focused on liquidity management to conserve resources in anticipation of an elongated economic downturn todate weve had direct dialogue with all borrowers with over million in exposure or of our portfolio and substantial dialogue below this level we assume that all borrowers will have some level of covid19 impact and are focused on evaluating our borrowers remediation efforts access to capital and contingency plans were also very pleased that congress and the entire federal government came together to expeditiously pass the cares act and stimulus measures a few weeks ago additionally we applaud the feds actions to reduce interest rates support liquidity in the financial markets through quantitative easing for a wide variety of asset classes and provide support for small and mediumsized businesses through its innovative new lending programs we recognize that the sba has a large task in front of them and im extremely proud to say that our people work tirelessly with them so that we could successfully process the ppp program loans on the first day we have dedicated over a quarter of our workforce to avail our clients of this important program and have successfully approved over applications totaling billion todate we anticipate funding approximately million per day as part of our broader risk management strategy we have prioritized implementing the ppp program as the most expedient method to quickly get incremental liquidity to our clients furthermore we believe that the newly initiated main street lending program when implemented provides incremental liquidity for our large clients as well as ppp participants our approach to loan modifications and deferment requests is to look for resourceful ways to partner with our clients along with assessing their willingness and capacity to support their business interests we are asking our clients to work handinhand with us for longterm solutions to hopefully shortterm challenging environment whereby our clients contribute liquidity capital or equity as an integral component to loan modifications our longerterm solutionsbased approach distinguishes us from industry standardized 90day deferral programs our approach collectively uses the resources of the borrower government and the banks balance sheet to develop solutions that extend beyond sixmonth window provided for in the cares act this negotiation process has likely slowed our modification pipeline as approximately million has been processed todate we learned during the last downturn when both the borrower and the bank use their resources to bridge the gap it generates a mutually favorable outcome with all of this as the backdrop id like to walk through our financial performance for the quarter despite a uniquely challenging operating rate environment i am proud to report that in the first quarter western alliance generated million of operating preprovision net revenue up yearoveryear and quarterto quarter we continued with the adoption of cecl accounting changes this quarter which resulted in a provision western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 for credit losses of million for the quarter of which was driven by our robust balance sheet growth dale will go into more detail in a bit on how the unique features of cecl drove our provisions but our aclto funded loan ratio now stands at wal generated net income of million or per share and tangible book value per share was this quarter we produced a nim of and had net recoveries of million and continue to improve our operating leverage even with our increased vigilance organic balance sheet continued to be healthy in  for both loans and deposits deposits grew billion to billion as we gained market share in several of our key business lines as well as traction in one of our recently launched deposit initiatives which added over million this highlights the continued strength of our diversified funding channels and overall deposit franchise to generate stable lowcost liquidity irrespective of the macroeconomic environment continuing on our strong momentum from total loans increased billion to billion approximately billion of this was through organic loan growth from new client projects and another million was credit line drawdowns of which approximately half was redeposited into the bank let me take a moment now to make a few highlevel comments on western alliance loan portfolio we believe that our welldiversified business model and purposeful decisions made over the past decade regarding conservative underwriting criteria and sector allocations positioned the portfolio to withstand the current economic environment at quarter end asset quality was stable with a decline in totally adverse graded loans and oreo to assets of from in  western alliance has no direct energy or large retail mall exposure we stopped making loans to the quick service restaurants sector several years ago with current exposure of only million our construction and land and development portfolio is now under of our loan book in our institutional lot banking business which makes up of the cld portfolio we have not received any deferral requests at this time single family residential construction which composes another was still experiencing positive absorption trends through march however aprils traffic has fallen off that portfolio was extremely wellpositioned coming into the pandemic and right now is performing as expected we are especially focused on monitoring and engaging with our clients in our hotel franchise finance and technology and innovation segments which will be reviewed in more detail later in the call during the quarter we repurchased million shares at an average price of additionally consistent with our 10b5 plan we purchased  thus far in  however given the rapidly changing environment we have now paused our share repurchase activity finally western alliance arrives at this crisis in a position of strength uniquely prepared to address whats ahead we remain well capitalized and highly liquid with a cet1 ratio of and ample liquidity total liquidity resources of over billion dale will now take you through our financial performance dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 for the first quarter western alliance generated net income of million or earnings per share net income was reduced by a million provision for credit losses driven by the adoption of cecl balance sheet growth as well as the change in the economic outlook due to the pandemic strong ongoing balance sheet momentum coupled with diligent expense management drove operating pre provision net revenue to million up from a year ago which we believe is the most relevant metric to evaluate the ongoing earnings power of the company net interest income and fee income remain relatively stable producing net operating revenue of million primarily a result of lower yields on loans which was partially offset by lower rates on deposits and borrowings noninterest income declined million to million from the prior quarter due to marktomarket of preferred stock holdings of primarily large money center banks of million partially offset by million equity investment gain todate of the million marked million has been recovered as credit spreads widened during the last quarter the yield on preferred stocks followed impacting valuations we do not believe this represents a permanently reduced valuation and that preferred stock values will continue to recover over time finally noninterest expense declined million as compensation and other operating expenses declined by million regarding implementing cecl in our allowance for credit losses in our 10k we disclosed the adoption impact of million million of which was attributable to funded loans million for unfunded commitments and million for heldtomaturity securities this resulted in a combined january allowance of million during  loan growth drove an additional million of required reserves and another million was driven by changes in the economic outlook as a result of the pandemic in total reserve build during the first quarter was million an increase of from the yearend reserve the quarterend acl of million was of funded loans up basis points provision expense for the quarter was million which is over times the average quarterly provision during as of march the reserve build reflects our best estimate of the future economic environment including the impact of government stimulus programs we utilized an assimilation of various moodys macroeconomic outlook scenarios to capture the most likely economic outcomes in a more severe scenario for potential tail risks as the economy continues to change we will adjust our acl modeling accordingly turning now to net interest drivers net interest income for the quarter declined a modest million from the prior quarter to million as there was one less day during the quarter compared to  and margin compression was offset by loan and deposit growth investment yield showed a modest improvement of basis points from the prior quarter to however on a linked quarter basis loan yields increased basis points due to the lower rate environment the average yield of our portfolio at quarterend or the spot rate was interestbearing deposit costs increased basis points in  to basis points as a result of immediate steps taken to reduce our deposit costs after the fomc cut rates twice in march the spot rate of total deposits at quarter end was basis points total funding costs decreased basis points when all of the companys funding sources are considered including noninterest bearing and borrowings western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 through the transition to a substantially lower rate environment during the quarter net interest income was million a decline of from  continued strong balance sheet growth and immediate steps taken to reduce the cost of interestbearing deposits counteracted the decline in prime and libor net interest margin declined basis points to during the quarter as our earning asset yield fell basis points partially offset by basis points funding cost decrease with regards to our asset sensitivity our rate risk profile has declined notably as the majority of our variable rate loan portfolio has flipped to fixed rate as floors have been triggered in the declining rate environment presently or billion of variable rate loans with floors are at the floors with the addition of our mix to shift primarily to fixed rate residential loans million or of loans are now behaving as a fixed rate portfolio this has reduced our interest rate risk and a basis point parallel shock lower scenario to at march from one year ago and assumes that rates are held flat at zero across the term structure turning now to operating efficiency on a linked quarter basis our efficiency ratio decreased basis points to as mentioned earlier the improvement was attributed to decreases in compensation and other operating expenses while our revenues increased modestly as a core component of our strategy we continue disciplined expense management to sustain industryleading operating leverage and profitability our core underlying earnings power remains strong as preprovision net revenue roa was flat from the prior quarter while return on assets was down basis points to directly related to our provision expense and excessive chargeoffs of million as ken mentioned earlier our strong balance sheet momentum from continued into  during the quarter loans increased billion to billion and deposits also grew billion to billion loan to deposit ratio increased to from in the fourth quarter our strong liquidity position continues to provide us with balance sheet capacity to meet funding needs shareholders equity declined by million as dividends and share repurchases were matched by net income tangible book value per share increased over the prior quarter to per share as our share count declined we continue to believe our ability to profitably grow deposits is both a key differentiator and a core value driver to our platforms longterm value creation  is a seasonally strong deposit quarter and coupled with the rollout of our deposit initiatives deposits grew billion the increase was driven by growth of billion in noninterest bearing dda primarily from market share gains in our mortgage warehouse operations additionally hoa continues to perform well and contributed million of lowcost deposits during the quarter the relative proportion of noninterest bearing dda grew to nearly of deposits from on a linked quarter basis turning to loan growth in line with the industry the vast majority of growth was driven by increases in ci loans totally billion followed million in construction and land development and million in residential residential loans now comprise of our portfolio while construction loans decreased as a relative proportion of the portfolio to from in the fourth western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 at the segment level tech innovation loans grew million with million from capital call and subscription lines and million from existing technology loan draws in turn bolstering technologyrelated deposits by million corporate finance loans grew million which was primarily due to line draws twothirds of which were from investment grade borrowers bringing utilization rates to from during the prior quarter mortgage warehouse also contributed loan growth of ph million approximately of which was due to the line draws across the bank one quarter or about million of our net new loan growth was driven by drawdowns on existing loan commitments from the beginning of the quarter in all total loan growth of million for the quarter was fully funded by deposit growth with the same amount overall asset quality was stable during the quarter with total adversely graded assets increasing million during the quarter to million while nonperforming assets comprised of loans on nonaccrual and repossessed real estate increased million to million or of total assets and is now is held for sale within these categories we had migration from special mention to substandard as some of the normal investor funding was delayed in tech innovation as a precaution when remaining liquidity declines below six months we bring those loans into either special mention or sub for enhanced monitoring and engagement this quarter we saw the cumulative impact of our efforts in managing certain special mention and substandard loans and several were resolved in our favor with no losses million of adversely graded loans resolved during the past quarter loans or million paid off in full while the other million were upgraded to pass as ken mentioned in his introduction were wellpositioned entering this economic cycle we only incurred of gross credit losses during the quarter which was more than offset by million in recoveries resulting in net recoveries of million we typically have one or two oneoff credit charges every quarter however highlighting the strength of our loan book we didnt experience any of these in  we believe early indication in identification and conservative management helps mitigate losses on these assets in all the acltofunded loans increased basis points to in  as a result of cecl adoption and the resulting provision expense related to  loan growth and changes in the economic outlook we continue to generate capital and maintain strong regulatory capital ratios with tangible common equitytototal assets of and a cet1 ratio of in  a reduction of tcetototal assets was mainly driven by billion increase in tangible assets due to our significant loan growth while the tangible common equity was affected by ph million of provisions in excessive chargeoffs due to cecl adoption in spite of reduced quarterly earnings and the payment of quarterly cash dividends of per share our tangible book value per share rose in the quarter and is up in the past year our diversified deposit generation platform and access to significant liquidity resources is critical in times of economic stress overall we have access to over billion in liquidity primarily through our billion investment portfolio of which billion are investment grade readily marketable and not pledged on any borrowing base additionally we have billion in unused borrowing capacity with the fed federal home loan bank and correspondent our strong capital base access to liquidity and diversified business model will allow us to address any credit demands in the future western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 ill now hand back the call to ken to conclude with comments on a few of our specific portfolios kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation thanks dale regarding our hotel franchise finance business we believe our focus on the selectservice subsegment conservative loan to cost underwriting discipline and strong operating partner sets us up for a maximum financial flexibility to weather the duration of the crisis like most hotels in the country our clients have seen a dramatic reduction in occupancy rates over the last month and senior management is involved in active dialogue with each borrower to evaluate remediation efforts and contingency plans going into the pandemic of the portfolio had an ltv under and more than had a debt service coverage ratio of times additionally we only partner with experienced hotel operators with significant invested equity and resources to support ongoing operations fully of the portfolio is with large sponsors who operate more than hotels and operate or more properties with top franchise or flags based on our ongoing constructive dialogue we believe that sponsors view this as a temporary event and want to continue to maintain and support these properties over the long term given their significant equity investments we are actively working with them to appropriate utilize the ppp program and the main street lending programs along with their own liquidity as a helpful financial bridge to arrive at a longerterm solution based on the mutually developed financial action plans we will selectively implement loan modifications along the lines we previously discussed this is a prime example where both parties contribute to a comprehensive solution now regarding our tech innovation business we primarily finance established growth technology firms with a strong risk profile mainly companies classified as stage with an established business model validated product multiple rounds of investment and a path to profitability this provides greater operating and financial flexibility in times of stress of the borrowers have revenues greater than million and have strong institutional backing with backed by one or more vc or pe firms during the quarter the portfolio grew million to billion or of the total portfolio which was attributed to million of existing line drawdowns in the technology division and an additional million from capital call lines a product that historically has had zero losses tech innovation commitments grew million in  and utilization rates increased to from in  the portfolio is fairly granular with average loan size of million and these borrowers are generally liquid with more than deposit coverage ratio additionally since warrant income has covered cumulative net chargeoffs times over currently of technology loans or million has less than six months remaining liquidity which is in line with historical trends although some fundraising has been delayed we were pleased to see several investment rounds closed over the last several weeks and days with strong continued sponsored support in conclusion we see increased cash generation driven by our balance sheet momentum going into the quarter end as well as continued loan growth from the ppp distributions we expect preprovision net revenue to continue to grow through  with the ability to absorb any necessary future provisions given uncertainty surrounding the likely duration of the virus and evolving economic environment we will continue to reassess our outlook as health and economic facts warrant regarding asset quality our proactive risk management approach is institutionalized throughout the company we are actively working with our borrowers to develop mutually agreed upon financial plans assuming an elongated economic downturn that leads to longterm solutions our strong collateral positions and little western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 unsecured or consumer lending should serve us well in mitigating potential risk of loss as we navigate these uncertain times we stand ready to implement the likely next phase of ppp and the main street lending program to assist our clients and communities finally western alliance has assembled a seasoned management team that has weathered several economic downturns and is applying the lessons learned from the great recession to face these uncertain economic times and with that well open up the line operator and well take everyones questions question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question today comes from casey haire of jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning guys dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation hey casey casey haire q analyst jefferies llc just question on the reserve build obviously a tricky proposition here but trying to get a you guys mentioned the use of a bunch of moodys scenarios could you just give us some color as to how much weighting was given to the moodys adverse scenario what kind of recovery you guys are assuming how much government help the stimulus stuff that the government is doing is offsetted and then obviously the duration i know thats a lot but just trying to get some color as to the magnitude of reserve build here dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah so we primarily used the baseline case as of march and then we looked at s1 and we looked at s3 s3 is the kind of the adverse scenario which is obviously more critical and a longer recovery period we do struggle with what is the timeline of this type of thing and how much the things come back we do think that the institutions and the plans done by the federal government and both on the congressional side as well as the fomc have an effect in terms of being able to mitigate this and make a bridge to when were at a time when we can start to turn the economy back on i dont have a timeline for you in terms of kind of when that is going to be but we will look at this were fully reserved as of march and well look at this again at the end of the second quarter kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah i would just add and say we did factor in some impact of the ppp program but as we were processing we didnt know what that size level was going to be so having participants over billion looking to go out is going to be very helpful i dont think its been fully factored into our reserve calculations but that billion will western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 help cover billion of commitments in our company or billion of current outstanding loans which means thats about of our current portfolio casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great and just following up on the loan modifications if i heard you right i think you said million to date so just specifically what exactly are you guys doing there and then like any color as to how much youve improved upon that million as of april here kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah by the way that million is april number casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation okay number two i would say in terms of color i think we caught a lot of our clients by surprise our borrowers by surprise when we said early on this is going to be a longerterm problem and lets have a longerterm solution rather than the standardized cookiecutter 90day pi deferral and by the way that took a lot of getting used to from our client base and we had to go back to them several times as weve had that conversation you can see that our viewpoint is more likely than not going to be correct we dont know how long its going to go but we said lets start with figuring it out and through the end of the year and because of that we need you the borrower to contribute something with more equity more collateral more liquidity to the project and then we will help you along with the deferral as well and we took each loan on a casebycase basis and we didnt make broad proclamations that said well just do days here so every loan has been different and i assume as we get into questions about different books of business ill give you some stories behind each one all those books of business but we think getting out there and dealing with our clients on a onetoone basis is going to be helpful and by the way the same lessons that we learned in the great recession by getting there early having conversations for the longer term helps our clients survive but more importantly they know that well be there when they start to see growth opportunities and the combination of their growth opportunities the ability to get through this gives them the ability to prosper longer term and thats our approach when we sit down and we talk to our clients case casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great just last one from me you guys clearly prioritizing the ppp program for loan growth just a question how are you guys funding this just trying to get a sense for what the incremental nim might be and regarding capital and liquidity are you willing to go much higher on the loantodeposit ratio and as well as on the tce ratio dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 so you may have noticed our ending balances for loans and deposits were significantly above the average balance for the first quarter so we had billion more in loans and billion more in deposits twothirds of the deposit number was in dda that gives us we think momentum in terms of expanding ppnr into you layer this billion then on top of that we have a myriad of ways to be able to fund this one is we think we have additional deposit opportunities two is the federal reserve has said theyll advance on these loans and three we have another billion of liquidity that we could get elsewhere so were not really concerned about funding that cost i think its going to be something around basis points if we put it to the fed its basis points to do that and well take these in so that again i think shows that we expect continued balance sheet growth into the second quarter primarily driven by these ppp notes casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay and if im understanding the ppp it comes on at around with the fees associated so it looks like about incremental margin dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah so casey haire q analyst jefferies llc is that right dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation our weighted fee on the billion weve done is and then these loans i mean the preponderance of this is clearly short term were going to call it six months but then for the part that isnt forgivable that has a tail that goes out two years casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation the actual loan rate on the entire program was so you get on the entire bucket and some of that is going to be accelerated in terms of recognition based upon the shortterm nature of the forgivable element casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thank you ill step back operator the next question today comes from arren cyganovich of citi please go ahead western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc thanks i was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the working with the customers i appreciate all the commentary i guess i just want to have a better understanding of what proportion of your customers are actually getting deferrals now and how that how those are categorized relative to the modifications that youre discussing kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation im going to ask tim bruckner our chief credit officer to take that one timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer executive vice president western alliance bancorporation right thank you and this is i think a nice followon to the discussion weve just had in the prioritization of this the customer conversation that dialogue is of top priority so that started for us back in february weve got two parts to this that have come into our common language theres the trough and then theres the recovery and stabilization and a new normal as a bank and as a business we know that the better that we do and the better that we help our borrowers through that trough in terms of proper planning the better that asset stabilizes in the new normal so the conversations are actually going very very well but there is obvious differences between borrowers and industries and businesses and so necessarily there is different conversations and discussions but what that lets us do as a business is then monitor that cash and liquidity through the trough and be best positioned in the recovery and in stabilization and normal whatever it is for their business and so its really a dialogue that started in february and itll continue throughout this entire process ppp is just part of it kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation so this is ken let me just its an interesting question that you asked because theres not one singular answer for the entire portfolio it depends which portfolio youre talking about but maybe some color behind the portfolios would be helpful here so for example were talking to everyone in the hotel book right thats hff thats billion well of those clients of our clients have already made their pi for april and then of the remaining are in deep conversations with us where we hope that well have something tied down in the next couple of weeks in terms of a modification program and then theyll make their payments at that time or maybe theyll extend first and then well get some payments after that so thats the thats the hotel book and thats how the conversation is going there the conversation say in lot banking is quite different were actually getting inbound calls and were and people are asking us are you going to be there when we find the opportunities and then our question is well are you looking for deferments and weve had a couple deferrals weve had a couple of clients call in and say im not going to ask for anything im looking at the future i need you to stand with us so those are just two different ways the book is different our gaming book okay is completely different than whats happening we think are gaming book other than five or six small deferrals that we made on principal we think our overall gaming book has enough liquidity to survive into the summer i would just so that makes our conversation there a little bit different we can take a little bit more time we can see how the main street lending facility can be accessed because the gaming companies could not access the ppp program so every different segment of our book has a different conversation and thats why if i can reiterate again and tim was very early on this in our and we do a weekly senior operating committee meeting but in the second or western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 third week of january he just stood up and said okay were going to have senior leaders be in charge of books of business across the entire company that have workout experience heavy credit experience have been through something like this and therefore we can tell each discussion differently thats for example robert running the hotel business robert was born with hotel business in his veins why wouldnt he take that on and run with that all right and so we looked for different strengths to match up against the portfolio here im sorry its a longer answer but i hope we gave you some color as to how were managing our conversations with our clients arren cyganovich q analyst citigroup global markets inc no thats very helpful i appreciate it thank you operator the next question today comes from brock vandervliet of ubs please go ahead brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thanks good morning just bigger big picture to start do you think this is going to be a mild or severe recession in the scale of recessions that youve that weve experienced in the past kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation well my answer keeps evolving as information evolves and i try not to be tick by tick but certainly more pessimistic than i was in early march and midmarch given that million people have recently filed for unemployment claims so i think its going to be deeper than ive ever experienced all right but i think our answers or our approach was one that we anticipated that it was going to be longer than what people thought we just didnt think the severity of what were seeing was going to be as deep brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and more specifically around investors real concerns here for the hotel book like what percentage of properties would you say go bankrupt in an average recession and would kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation okay so im sorry brock i didnt mean to cut you off brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc yeah go ahead kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation okay so we went back and we looked at the ge this was originally the ge business and we bought it in ge from ge in so we went back and we looked at their performance level from to and during that time during those eight years total losses amounted to million average chargeoff of basis points with western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 peak losses coming in at they had a portfolio of about billion in size now whats important to note is their portfolio was completely different than the model that we constructed their portfolio was more of a shotgun approach they had weak flags we do not they had small operators we do not they had weak sponsors we do not and they had ltvs of and our ltv as i said earlier are about so we have a different model than what they have but thats our best look back to get a gauge of what may happen going forward adjusting for the difference of our models tim do you want to add anything timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer executive vice president western alliance bancorporation i just want to add one thing to that is i think if you really look at it to our sponsorship and sophistication of investor composition is a lot different than that legacy portfolio as well we really have the larger operators the higher level of sophisticated investor when we have these dialogues and say come on were solving for something here that isnt days we have folks that understand why and how we can work together and do that and thats going to keep the leverage down on this portfolio how we do on that puts us in the position and the rebound that we want to be in brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc and lastly the debt service coverage ratios that you show on page are those as of  or are those through april because clearly hotel performance has gotten deteriorated kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah no therere for  brock we wouldnt have that information that quickly for april brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay all right thanks for the color kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation okay thank you operator the next question today comes from brad milsaps of piper sandler please go ahead brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer executive vice president western alliance bancorporation good morning western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation good morning brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co ken i think you gave the stat on the tech book that of the companies had cash on hand for six months or less which was pretty consistent with history i was curious if you can give that same kind of stat for the hotel book obviously i know that the ppp program is having an impact there as well but just kind of want to get any kind of sense on kind of the forward look on debt service coverage for that book if you could look at it in a similar way to as you look at the tech book kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation well i dont have the stat on what the collective liquidity is for the hotel book we are that is one of the single most important questions we ask our clients and its were gathering that information as we speak they generally dont run with a lot of liquidity and now heres my however my however is if you are a recently opened hotel which we have a couple they have liquidity because they had that liquidity on their balance sheet getting ready for the opening so theyre okay if youre a hotel that was building up your reserve do a pip you have some of that liquidity if youre a hotel thats been operating for a while and distributions have gone back to your investors you have less and therefore we have to talk to you we go to the investors we get a capital call to come for you to get a defer to get some deferral so a little bit different and thats why one of the things that if i can keep repeating here case by case individual hotel by individual hotel and or individual property throughout the whole book of business brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co okay and just maybe a followup two followups one how large is the gaming book and then secondly i think at the end of last year you had about billion of unfunded commitments in total for the whole loan portfolio can you talk about the potential for those to be drawn down maybe where youve cut those two and amplifications of that without addon capital kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation so ill take the easy question and then ill flip it over to dale for the harder one the simple answer is million on gaming dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah so the most significant draw weve ever had on unfunded has been of that amount which frankly we got close to kind of where we were with this drawdown were not seeing any more additional draws at this time were in fact weve had some kind of repayments of some of those draws so we dont see and a lot of these draws theyre i mean theyre or these commitment lines we dont think they would really kind of ever be drawn down in terms of the structure behind some of these credits so while we have these unfunded elements to them and we did have a drawdown in march predominantly were not seeing anything else subsequent to that western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co okay great thank you guys ill hop back in queue operator the next question today comes from chris mcgratty of kbw please go ahead dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation hey chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great hey dale quick question on just the balance sheet trajectory given the comments about the gross and the draws any thoughts on adjusting the resi mortgage strategy a bit just in light of the capital and liquidity dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation so the resi the purchase of resi mortgages may be far more opportunistic right now than weve ever seen as some of our clients are selling their mortgages at significant discounts which will allow us to go ahead and buy at higher yields than we bought in  so were going to look at that the keyword we used to use or we used for our share repurchase was opportunistic same thing here if we can get the right risk reward tradeoff in fact therere resi mortgages available that have better or lower ltvs lower dtis and higher fico scores that are selling for much higher yields than we recently purchased say at the end of so well look at that and if theres opportunity there were going to take advantage of it i think an important thing on this program as well as on the hotel book is collateral i mean we are in strong collateral positions such that it would take considerable sustained valuation declines to ever pierce where we are in terms of risk of loss christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and just if i can follow up dale in terms of the cet1 or the tangible obviously this quarter had a big jump down just because of the growth where do you comfortably run those ratios in this environment over the next few quarters dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation well i mean so we saw a decline in those two now with the ppp program that could pull down our tce it really wont have an effect on cet1 because those are all risk weight as theyre sba backed but we can see this number come down christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 okay and then maybe a last one if i could do it the color on the hotel history of loss is great could you do a similar run through of the tech book in terms of peak losses when you didnt own it i think they were kind of in the midsingle digit in their early stage but just blended i think theyre around any color would be great dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation your recollection is correct i dont have those in front of me but well pull them up as you know theyre available on snl kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah last time i looked at it and it was a while ago and it wasnt for this particular situation as i said in my prepared remarks there is a times coverage of the warrant income to the credit losses and as you know credit losses come early and the warrant income comes later but when you look at it overall that the warrant income that we get has always covered the more than covered the credit losses unfortunately we it just cant be timed to be in the same quarter dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation i think its also notable that our mix has changed since then as well so were now doing a significant portion of our growth has been in these capital call and subscription lines its not something that bridge was engaged in as a standalone enterprise but something that we entered as part of our risk mitigation strategy essentially last year to really lend into areas that have had zero to no losses historically for not just us but for other participants in the space kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation let me give you some color as part of our review just so you know ill speak for tim bruckner for a second but every monday at my so senior operating committee meeting we set the tone for what were going to try to accomplish that week that month that quarter and so forth depending on the circumstances and then we run two senior loan committees on tuesdays and thursdays basically were not really approving senior loan packages but we are reviewing large credits that are being worked on for modifications and then tim holds individual weekly meetings with each one of our risk segments so were daily talking to a segment and getting live information so on the tech innovation which is as live as i can get it i was asking the credit officer there last night how would you describe our book of business and the way he just said what he said was i see rating turbulence but i dont see large losses so things can move around in terms of pass not pass but at this point the book is behaving well at this point timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer executive vice president western alliance bancorporation yeah i might add just one more point to that weve seen the support from the sponsorship were in these transactions at a low loantovalue with a number of rounds typically in front of us before were in and so what were seeing is if anything takes a hit here its a hit on valuation before it impacts our loan so the rounds are clearing the funding is occurring the valuations might be slightly lower but the capital still flowing in this segment and that gives me some comfort western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for all the color operator your next question comes from timur braziler of wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe for dale first you had indicated that youre starting to see some of the utilization come back is that in the technology book as well or are those utilization rates still increasing dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation our utilization rates are fairly stable from where we are right now on both sides both on the tech innovation as well as in the corporate finance area timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then of the of the tech loans which have six months or less of liquidity have any of those been funded up in the last couple of weeks or was your commentary in the prepared remarks for other relationships dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation no whats there now has not been funded up we had a couple of sponsors put money into a couple projects right before the end of the quarter which was helpful to us but overall that number has been relatively steady in bridges history but we are encouraged by what were seeing away from us with sponsors completing their rounds we actually had credit that wasnt in any trouble in our life science yesterday they got a substantial amount of sponsor financing so were not seeing it were not seeing the sponsor financing run away from us or run away from the industry timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just one more on the loan modification it looks like at least through quarter end the majority of it was within your arizona and nevada portfolios i guess whats driving that is that forbearance on residential loans or why such a high number out of those two geographies western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation its really the pace and cadence of those customer discussions those discussions drive that the discussion results in an assessment of liquidity liquidity necessary to bridge the trough in some cases that liquidity already exists the solution which may include some form of modification is tailored to the liquidity goal so its really just the pace and cadence of those discussions timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then last question for me for you ken with your commentary that you are a little more pessimistic now than you were in midtolate march im just wondering how that correlates with using the baseline moodys assumption for allowance should we see another tick higher for adjustment on the existing portfolio or at this time are you still comfortable with the million that was provided for the existing book in detail kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation so im comfortable with the provision that we provided at quarter end based on everything we knew at that time right im sorry i just had a senior moment second part of your question was indiscernible kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah dale do you want to take that or dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation well so obviously this seems to change almost by the hour in terms of what the expectations are and since then weve had some worse news weve had north of million people file for unemployment we maybe got teased with some good news with last night with a treatment that looks like its going to be proved to be efficacious for this in the next days my guess is theres going to be a lot more news and so were going to reassess this at the end of june in terms of what that looks like if we can get things back in some track upward again in terms of the economic outlook i could see things getting better if thats not the case if were still doing kind of in this lockdown phase i dont think thats were probably looking at additional provision in the second quarter cant really say right now kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah i just im sorry recaptured my thought i froze there for a moment thinking but i think whats going to be surprising to folks is that the pace of chargeoffs are going to be or the cycle is going to be pushed out and elongated because of the ppp program and because of the main street lending facility and i think people i think investors will be surprised that there arent heavy chargeoffs coming early on maybe on some of the smaller businesses you would expect to see them but on some of the larger credits i dont see chargeoffs coming to the back part of the year if they come at that time right western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 and so now adding to dales comment depending how quickly the country opens up and the speed of the pace well then determine what we need to do as we look forward at the end of  timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc good commentary thank you operator the next question today comes from jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning guys dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation good morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks for that comment ken i was just going to ask about that but maybe well go at it different way with provision so dale i think what youre saying is things are a little better by june or july that million incremental in the provision would go away for  is that the right way to think about it dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation well i wouldnt necessarily say that that million would be reversed i mean if the outlook at the end of june is similar to what it was at the end of the first quarter i think that theres no additional amount given for deterioration of credit conditions so i think that holds with that million for that to be released back in the income i think we probably have to get to a farther period down the road and say you know what we actually are well on our way toward reducing our unemployment rate were bringing people back in and so the outlook is better than kind of what is the base case for moodys at the end of the first quarter and which that has an extended return i mean thats some of that really is held down through if instead you get back to something that resembles more of pick your letter right a v or a u instead of like a lazy u or an l i think there is a possibility that you could release that i think what ken said was were not really expecting to experience chargeoffs if and when they come until after these periods of the ppp program the main street lending program and as well as the rules allowing for certain types of some of these restructurings that can be done in the sight of this overall pandemic thats going to push out recognition of loss at least i think a couple of quarters jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 okay that will make sense im not saying reversal im just saying it doesnt show up again in  i guess the other question is on margin it appears like youre set up reasonably well from a margin perspective i appreciate all the disclosure but give us an idea of some of the near term longer term puts and takes how are you thinking about the margin dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah so we have a lot of clients that are at their floors we talked about that i would say competitively at this point in time spreads have widened out as rates came down as uncertainty rose if that settles in you could see that maybe some of the spreads would actually come down over time which could put pressure on earning asset yields on a more longer term basis i think that assumes that things are getting better economically well if things are getting better economically maybe the fed is then inclined to look at where we are on the zero band and start putting that back up so it could be a scenario that you actually dont see rates coming down in terms of loans generally because at the same time spreads are declining maybe overall base rates start to rise because people are comfortable in terms of kind of the recovery of the economy so but those are two dynamics that i really dont know how to gauge but we are at the zero bound here i dont see obviously i dont think things are going to get lower the fed has come out and said that theyre against negative rates i think that would certainly be a mistake to go there so i mean you maybe have this kind of overall lighter compression over time but as of right now thats certainly not the case as ken indicated on the residential side in particular we actually have seen rates rise and in fact spreads in residential loans have increased in some cases and really havent participated in terms of the rate cuts that have taken place jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good and then ken maybe one more for you you talked earlier about billion in organic loan growth and maybe a third of it was drawdowns is i think what you said could you talk a little bit about the quality of that growth how you think about that is it seems like still a big number for a lot of uncertainty in the economy so maybe just bigger picture broader talk about the quality of the growth and maybe some of the drivers of that kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah so the loan growth was billion the credit drawdowns brought it down to what would have been billion that was our estimate somewhere early into the quarter when we started to see some opportunities filled now where that growth came from capital call lines industry has never had a loss came from warehouse lending weve had that business plus years weve never had a loss it came in resort financing not only had we never had a loss but the team has been running that business for years has never had a loss so if you can forget about the pandemic for a second and go back to our approach in we started talking about de risking the balance sheet cld was coming down which it has and you saw the uptake in our residential book of business and our warehouse funding and our capital call lines and resort financing so those businesses are zero or very low risk loss businesses and i would expect the volume for  to match what we did in  on organic basis but i would expect the growth to come in those business segments that i just mentioned western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right thanks a lot guys i appreciate it kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation i appreciate it operator the next question today comes from tyler stafford of stephens please go ahead tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc hey good morning guys maybe just to start on that last question there or last comment can you just talk about the balance sheet growth expectations this year obviously a strong start here in the first quarter you mentioned some of the draw downs on the lines but just how should we think about both loan and deposit growth for the remainder of the year relative to that prior kind of million to range thanks dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation im not going to put a number out there there are just so many moving factors i have a little more visibility around  and i think i would plan absent the ppp loan portfolio i think i would plan on the lower end of that range million to million on deposits million to million on loans and if we surprise to the upside then great we put in on the deposit side a number of different programs that we thought we hope that could be successful andor maybe take some market share from our peer group well see if we could make that happen for the rest of the year but i think towards the lower end of that range would be the right thing to do and dont forget when we spike in  and have some of that spike hold on in  because of the ppp loans theyre going to just fall way towards the back half of the year tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc fair enough i fully recognize theres lots of puts and takes there thanks the rest of my questions have been asked and answered operator the next question today comes from david chiaverini of wedbush securities please go ahead david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks a followup on the hotel book you mentioned that loan modifications are going through at the end of the year hypothetically if hotels remain empty until a vaccine is developed which could be to months from now at one point and under what scenario would you move to foreclose on the hotel properties kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation david if we came across the end of the year i meant the end i thought i said the end of the quarter or during the second quarter so thats what indiscernible western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc so yeah dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation what were looking for is were looking for solutions that combine capital contribution from the borrower with our ability to give them a deferral or some relief and a modification that takes this beyond three months beyond six months which we see a lot of the other competitors doing it seems like theyre just handing out kind of three months deferrals and say well lets address this again in june or july were not doing that were trying to bridge to a longer time line in terms of what does this look like so i mean these borrowers they have obligations were going to be able to give them some relief on this type of thing but and a lot of them have considerable resources to draw upon so is there a situation whereby some of them become very stressed and we see migration down to special mention down to substandard i think thats certainly the case what its going to take for us to foreclose on one of these well we have a value we have our shareholders that we need to respond to and were going to be accountable to that and were going to be responding to that thats why we think the loantovalue is so important here because if somebody isnt if somebody doesnt want to be able to continue here or has to throw in the keys then its like okay well as long as hotels overall havent fallen more than of original value we probably have very nominal risk of loss because of where we are in the strong ltv david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thats helpful thanks for that and then shifting gears you mentioned about how the main street lending program should benefit some of your larger customers i was wondering will you be able to swap out your existing loans for the new loan under the facility and essentially transfer the risk to the government dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation no no the program doesnt allow for that in terms of when you issue of main street lending program it has to be a new disbursement it cant pay off something thats already outstanding david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc okay and do you believe the program is big enough to make a difference because looking at the sba ppp program that those funds were exhausted fairly quickly dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation well i mean they were exhausted fairly quickly and i guess it remains to be seen whether theyre going to reauthorize that for another million im not sure that the process for the main street lending program is going to be as complicated a pathway as it is for the federal reserve you dont have to have two different parties from different opposite ends of this political spectrum to be able to unite on something and agree you have to get the fomc the board of governors of the federal reserve system to agree on this so i dont know i mean i think it remains to be seen what the demand is they put it out there at million that seems like thats got western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 some room to go it obviously goes to much larger enterprises billion of revenue employees so well see about kind of what that looks like but i havent heard anything about that but i think they want to get it going and maybe see what the demand is before they go on from there but again we expect to be early we were early with ppp we got billion if you look at the portion of what we did in ppp relative to our size to the overall banking community in the country we had a much higher penetration than most institutions david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc and then the last one for me is in the slide deck it was mentioned about of the variable rate loans with floors are at those floors can you remind us whats the average life or average stated maturity of those loans dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation well the average stated maturity for our loan book is just under four years and its going to track pretty closely with that david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks very much operator the next question today comes from gary tenner of da davidson please go ahead gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co hey thanks guys good morning i just wanted to ask a couple of question on the ppp dale i think you mentioned that as those get funded theyll be in the balance sheet for up to six months i thought the timeline for when the bank or borrower could i guess supply to have the loan forgive was about seven weeks is that is there something different than my understanding there dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation well let me clarify it a little bit so you obtain a ppp loan and the portion of that that is forgivable ie thats used to cover employee compensation certain elements of rents and other basic expenses thats the part that that can be forgiven by the sba and so that isnt going to be a shorter timeline the actual ppp loans themselves are two years so what we see is we see what was the usage somebody gets a loan for x amount what is the usage of that about twothirds of the amount used for these loans has been for something that should be ultimately forgivable because those funds are going to be used to support those particular items that are identified in the legislation the back third something that isnt forgivable and so thats going to be more of a term structure for two years gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay thanks and the fees on that youll be accounting for them through spread income or is that indiscernible western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation it will go through spread income and itll be frontend loaded because of the kind of the odd nature of how these loans are going to amortize with the payment forgiveness and then the borrower responsible for the rest gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co right so it would artificially inflate the margin say in the second quarter and then have a lesser impact as they get paid off beyond that dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah second and third gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co yeah so then and then just a followup in terms of the paydowns i think ken you mentioned some pay downs from those of the loans that were drawn in march youve seen some of the repayments so could you maybe quantify what youve seen in terms of the repayments on some of those loans dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation its been modest what i meant to say is were not seeing additional draws of any significance and theres been some modest payments it seems to have been stabilized and that echoes what im hearing from these other institutions i think bofa made a particular comment about this but if you look at where these corporate finance loans who the syndicator is its jpmorgan its bofa its wells fargo its the larger institutions and i think what were seeing really mirrors with what theyre talking about gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay thanks dale operator the next question comes from michael young of suntrust robinson humphrey please go ahead michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey thanks for taking the question maybe just a followup ken on your comments about net chargeoffs and when theyd be realized i guess maybe in particular could you just talk about high level where you think those will come from at this point it sounds like maybe you dont expect as much from hotel given the collateral base there but would it be more tech and life sciences businesses with less collateral base or some of the ci categories in particular shared national credits or anything like that that maybe were not seeing or focusing on right now kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2020 so i think i took a little bit of a step out there saying i just think chargeoffs will be a little bit later my crystal ball isnt as clear to say which group is it are going to have the chargeoffs and i dont feel comfortable really putting that out there at this time i just dont as the things are changing so quickly that i would clearly be wrong and i just rather hold back my intuitive feel on that but i do feel generally that chargeoffs will come later in the year and not as early as people think michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and then maybe dale just on the shared national credit book i think that was a strategy that you guys had in the past on a small basis maybe it gotten up to about billion maybe in outstanding at one point can you just tell us the balance at this point and anything that we should be looking at there in terms of mitigating factors dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah i mean were probably at about billion i mean most of the draws that have come down have come down in sncs and as weve talked about in the past this is a kind of low investment grade portfolio the syndicators are as i just mentioned the large banking companies that we participated in at times weve tried to do so so that we can augment our ability to push forward deposits from some of these enterprises that are in our markets and so weve taken a little piece of them michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and then maybe just last one for me just on the expenses obviously pretty decent step down this quarter really i assume lower comp expectations but is that kind of a new run rate that we should kind of base growth off of from here or any other factors that may be shifted meaningfully with kind of everyone working from home et cetera dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation i think were on a lower trajectory from where we were with this shutdown were continuing to do the necessary investments that we have in technology to make sure our platform continues to support what were doing today which is basically executing on our business resumption continuity programs michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thats all for me thanks kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation well it looks like weve exhausted all the questions so we ran longer we thank you for spending time with us we look forward to talking to you
