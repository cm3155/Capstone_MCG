corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good afternoon and welcome to western alliance first quarter earnings call joining me on the call today are dale gibbons and tim bruckner our chief financial officer and chief credit officer i will first provide an overview of our quarterly results and how we are managing the business in this current economic environment and then dale will walk you through the banks financial performance afterwards well open the line and we will take your questions the continued growth in western alliances national commercial business strategy drove financial results and balance sheet growth to record quarterly highs to kick off mirroring the companys strong fourth quarter performance and underlying fundamental trends wal earned net income of million and earnings per share of for the quarter million yearoveryear and nearly flat to  net revenue expanded times the rate of expenses as improvement in asset quality and economic conditions drove million release in the loan loss reserve this quarter our focus continues to be on ppnr growth which rose approximately yearoveryear to million while marginally lower than last quarter due to two fewer days regarding the acquisition of amerihome i am pleased that the closing took place approximately three weeks ahead of schedule while personnel and technology integrations are minimal we have begun to focus on balance sheets and funding synergies with the pay down of external credit lines additionally we signed agreements with the sale of approximately million of mortgage servicing rights to strong counterparties that will allow western alliance to retain substantially all the custodial deposits we expect this to be completed in early may amerihome was an attractive strategic acquisition expanding western alliances fee income and lowering the companys reliance on spread income while providing growth optionality to our commercial portfolio of businesses turning to the first quarter balance sheet trends outstanding quarterly loan and deposit growth of billion and billion respectively lifting total assets to billion up from the prior year our nearterm focus on growing loans in low risk asset classes was on display as loan growth was primarily driven by warehouse funding residential loan purchases and increased activities throughout our traditional banking and regional footprint our deposit growth was broad based across our franchise which pushed down our loantodeposit ratio to and created a strong funding foundation for ongoing loan and earnings growth from our commercial loan pipeline and the amerihome acquisition the continued excess liquidity from our improving deposit franchise is at the expense of shortterm nim compression but its a tradeoff we are willing to accept for longterm value creation this impressive loan growth drove net interest income to million or million higher than last quarter and up on a yearoveryear basis quarterly net interest margin was down from the fourth quarter as we continued to deploy excess liquidity into loans and investment securities noninterest income totaled million for the quarter aided by million of warrant income from bridge bank asset quality remained stable this quarter as the economic recovery gained steam for the quarter net loan charge offs were million or basis points on an annualized basis credit losses may not appear in any meaningful way as prior and proposed stimulus packages continue to positively impact consumer spending habits and many businesses were provided the liquidity to weather the pandemic western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 finally western alliance continues to generate significant excess capital which accrued tangible book value per share of for yearoveryear growth we remain one of the most profitable banks in the industry with a return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity of and respectively this strong momentum coupled with economic reopening positions western alliance well for an industry leading at this time ill let dale take you through the financial performance dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks ken for the quarter western alliance generated net income of million or per share each down about from the prior quarter this is inclusive of reversal credit loss provisions of million due to continued improvement in economic forecast relative to yearend in continued loan segments with historically very low loss rates additionally merger expenses related to the amerihome acquisition of were recognized we expect total merger charges to be approximately million preponderance of which will be incurred in  as integration continues net interest income grew million during the quarter to million an increase of year overyear primarily as a result of our significant balance sheet growth however while average earning assets grew billion the relative proportion held in cash and lower yielding securities increased to approximately in  from in  which temporarily muted our interest income growth as we prepared to deploy excess liquidity into amerihome generated assets and higher yielding commercial loans quarteroverquarter our loan to deposit ratio fell to from in  as we proactively look to grow low cost deposits as dry powder for future loan growth noninterest income fell million to million from the prior quarter mainly driven by smaller fair value gain adjustments in our securities measured at fair value to partially offset by million in warrant income non interest expense increased million mainly due to higher deposit costs as lower rates were offset by higher average balances continued balance sheet growth generating superior net interest income drove preprovision net revenue of million up over from a year ago turning now to net interest drivers as our strong core deposit growth continued throughout the quarter we look to redeploy excess liquidity into the investment portfolio and loans total investments grew billion for the quarter or to billion compared to an average balance of billion investment yields declined basis points from the prior quarter to due to lower reinvestment rates in the current environment similarly on a linkedquarter basis loan yields declined basis points following ongoing mix shift toward residential loans and asset class with generally lower yields in the remainder of the portfolio and low credit risk this was partially offset by modestly higher ppp fees strong loan growth and liquidity deployment towards the end of the quarter significantly quarter end balances for loans and investments were billion higher than the average balances and yielded more than our fed account higher income from this already deployed liquidity positions us well for  interestbearing deposit costs were reduced by basis points in  to basis points due to ongoing repricing efforts and maturities of higher cost cds the spot rate for total deposits which includes noninterestbearing was basis points we expect funding costs had generally stabilized at these levels net interest income increased million to million during the quarter yearoveryear as higher loan investment balances offset net interest margin compression nim declined basis points to million as our western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 purposeful strong deposit growth in advance of closing the amerihome acquisition negatively impacted the margin by basis points to put this in perspective average securities and cash balances the interestearning assets increased meaningfully in  to from given our higher end quarter loan balances healthy loan pipeline and ability to deploy this excess liquidity over the coming quarters into higher yielding earning assets we expect this margin drag to moderate while net interest income climbs additionally a ppp loan yield of benefited the nim by basis points which was similar to the fourth quarter benefit cumulatively over the remainder of we expect to recognize million of ppp fees our efficiency ratio rose basis points to an increase from in  this higher efficiency ratio was driven by a modest decline in noninterest income and an increase in expenses partially offset by increased net interest income noninterest expense linkedquarter growth increased by driven by higher deposit fees related to the annualized rise in deposit balances excluding ppp net loan fees and interest the efficiency ratio for the quarter would have been inclusive of amerihome we expect the efficiency ratio to rise to the mid this quarter preprovision net revenue declined million or from the prior quarter but increased from the same period last year this results in ppnr roa of for the quarter a decrease of basis points compared to for the yearago period partially impacted by a much larger asset base this continued strong performance in capital generation provides a significant flexibility to fund ongoing balance sheet growth capital management actions or meet credit demands balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans increased billion or to billion and deposit growth of billion brought balances to billion at quarterend inclusive of the second round of ppp funding loans grew yearoveryear while deposits grew approximately yearoveryear with our focus on low ph loss loan segments and dda in all total assets have grown yearoveryear as we approach the billion asset level including amerihome finally tangible book value per share increased over the prior quarter to an increase of or over the prior year attributable to both net income and the common stock offering of million shares completed during  in anticipation of the amerihome acquisition our strong loan growth continues to benefit from flexible national commercial business strategy the majority of the billion in growth was driven by an increase in ci loans of million loan growth was also strong in residential real estate loans of million supplemented by construction loans of million and cre non owner occupied loans of million residential and consumer loans now comprise of our loan portfolio an increase from a year ago within the ci growth for the quarter and highlighting our focus on lowrisk assets mortgage warehouse loans grew million and round ppp loans originations were million which were nearly offset by million from round of payoffs we continue to believe our ability to grow core deposits from diversified funding channels is our key to firms long term value creation given the ability to deploy funds into attractive assets in the near term we purposefully looked to expand balance sheet liquidity in  deposits grew billion or in the first quarter driven by increases in noninterestbearing dda of billion which now comprise of our deposit base and savings and money market of billion western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 market share gains in mortgage warehouse continue to be a significant drivers of deposit growth during the quarter along with robust activity in tech and innovation and seasonal inflows from hoa banking relationships developed during our asset quality remained strong and borrowers are stable liquid and supported by strong sponsors total classified assets increased million in  to million due to migration of a few borrowers in covid impacted industries such as travel leisure and entertainment as reopening continues but at an uneven pace we see the potential for these credits to be upgraded as travel and events increase in the coming quarters our nonperforming loans plus oreo ratio declined basis points to total assets and total classified assets rose basis points to total assets to compared to the ratio at the end of special mention loans increased million during the quarter to of funded loans as weve discussed before sm loans are a result of our credit mitigation strategy to early identify elevate and apply heightened monitoring to loans or segments impacted by the current covid environment and fluctuate as credits migrate in and out we do not see credit losses emerging from special mention volatility regarding loan deferrals as of quarterend we had million of deferrals all of which are in low ltv residential loans quarterly net credit losses were modest at million or basis points of average loans compared to million in the fourth quarter our loan acl fell million from the prior quarter to million due to improvement in macroeconomic forecasts and loan growth in portfolio segments with low expected loss rates in all total loan acl to funded loans declined basis points to basis points or when excluding ppp loans for comparison purposes the loan acl to funded loans was basis points at yearend before cecl adoption we continue to generate capital and maintain strong regulatory ratios the tangible common equity to total assets of were down this quarter by strong asset growth and the common equity tier ratio of an increase of basis points during the quarter mainly driven by our common stock offering and growth in low risk assets inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment of a share our tangible book value per share rose in the quarter to an increase of in the past year ill now turn the call back over to ken kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks dale western alliance is one of only a handful of growth banks in the industry with doubledigit loan growth liquidity to fund the growth strong improving net interest income that generates consistent peerleading roa and return on average tangible common equity with steady asset quality and low net chargeoffs going forward based on our current pipelines we expect loan and deposit growth of billion to billion per quarter which will drive higher net interest income and ppnr growth we expect nim pressure to subside through the deployment of liquidity into attractive asset classes one of the characteristics of amerihome that we found very attractive is that it provides a natural solution to wals excess liquidity amerihome will be expanding its product array to include higher yielding nonqm and jumbo loans that fit our established credit box placing and holding these loans on our balance sheet enhances our existing residential mortgage purchase program and is a worthy credit solution for the swift deployment of excess liquidity western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 to keep pace with balance sheet performance our risk management programs and technology platforms are evolving and expenses will rise but will be offset by the revenue generated from excess liquidity deployment there will be no drag on ppnr or eps of these investments inclusive of amerihome the efficiency ratio will rise to the mid finally our longterm asset quality and loan loss reserves are informed by the economic consensus forecasts incorporating risk for tail economic events which if consistent going forward could imply a steady reserve balance depending on the timing and pace of the recovery there could be some loan migration into the special mention category but we do not expect material migration into substandard we believe the provisions in excess of chargeoffs since the pandemic began are more than sufficient to cover chargeoffs through the cycle as we do not see any indicators that imply material losses are on the horizon to conclude western alliance is wellpositioned for balance sheet growth with steady asset quality ppnr should continue its upward trajectory from  along with industryleading return on assets and equity at this time dale tim and i are happy to take your questions question and answer section operator thank you at this time we would like to take any questions you might have for us today operator instructions we have our first question from the line of brock vandervliet from ubs your line is open brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks very much dale if you could review with the closing of amerihome what does the debt paydown picture look like and how is that going to shape your ability to kind of soak up this excess liquidity in the near term dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so were doing that now they had about over a little over billion worth of borrowings and were phasing those out kind of going forward i think were going to i think thats going to be done say by the sometime in the second quarter what were also going to be getting from amerihome is were going to be able to have a kind of ready deployment into mortgages that we would want to put in our balance sheet and wed prefer to have something that is low ltv but higher yielding which pushes you toward kind of a nonqm solution which theyre going to be rolling that product out as well so as our ability to do that happens and i think over the next couple of quarters thats going to be the case i mean it wasnt random that we had this kind of massive deposit growth during the quarter we let it go in terms of bringing in more deposits because now we have a near term ready access to an almost limitless source of good quality asset deployment and i think youre going to see that in brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and i think the on amerihome the gain on sale picture has darkened somewhat since you announced the deal can you give us any sense of what their gain on sale was in  and how that may have compared to the prior quarter or prior year western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp we cant talk about their  performance because theyre part of a public enterprise indiscernible announced yet but what we did mention was amerihome has the ability to pivot so we expected that margins were going to be coming down that is taking place today but they have also the ability to take what we call their win rate which was about and that is ph lying about of the loans that they looked at to and to increasing that and so theyve been doing that as well so theyre pivoting appropriately and were standing by the that we indicated amerihome was going to benefit us in i think youre going to see to of that in the second quarter as we phase this in including the thing you just inquired about brock regarding being able to pay down their loans and stuff like that so were in that process right okay thats where we are kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp hey brock its ken i just want to add a few things i if you recall back to our earnings call in or our conference call in early february when we announced amerihome we said that there were other opportunities to earn more than the accretion numbers that we provided we held those back because of some uncertainty that we saw coming potentially with rising rates and were using all of those as we intended to in order to maintain our earnings estimates for amerihome brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay appreciate the color operator thank you we have our next question from the line of casey haire from jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thanks good morning guys kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning casey haire q analyst jefferies llc i wanted to touch on the deposit growth i mean you guys i mean even with the updated with bumping up the guide i mean this quarter youve really massively outperformed that just wondering is there still it feels like the environment is still ripe to continue to do that is it possible that the deposit growth is conservative based on the current environment based on what youre seeing kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so you think its conservative because we told you million and we came in at billion western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yes kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp maybe look were bumping up to a billion to billion weve been performing at this level or better for the last six to eight quarters we have some real visibility into the pipeline based on either oral commitments or things were just finishing up the paperwork on now so yeah there is a possibility to exceed both the deposit guide as well as the loan guide casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay and on so on the cash balance at on average in the quarter and i realize that you guys did get to work in the back half of the quarter with securities and loans but even with the paydown on the amerihome debt youre still probably at around of cash ph position what is your target level how comfortable are you driving that to what level kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so i mean the billion to billion is what we consider to be kind of a core number but as we deploy that and pull that number down and that number can fall substantially and frankly the securities book is at least a third or higher than it needs to be too now thats better than cash but not as good as some of these other loanbased alternatives so i do expect that were going to have a couple of quarters where were going to rightsize our loantodeposit ratio it wasnt that long ago that we were in the now were down at well doing that means that loan growth will be well in excess of a billion as weve increased that loantodeposit ratio thats going to get under way in the next in the not too distant future casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great and just some followups on the nim side of things the new money loan yields that youre seeing in on mortgage as well as new money yields on securities purchases kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so the securities purchases the yields that we got was at and new loan yields that were putting on are running about to basis points lower than what the average is i think we are experiencing pricing pressure i think that the velocity that the industry and the economy has come out of this pandemic has resulted in kind of reduced expectations for credit losses industry wide and thats being reflected in price but again what weve got the ability to do is to drive volume and to shift our focus in terms of where the best kind of riskadjusted returns will be western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay just to clarify dale so i mean your existing loan yield in the quarter was around i would think resi mortgages is lower than that right or dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah no resi mortgages that we are putting on our books are around casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you okay thank you operator thank you your next question is from the line of brad milsaps from piper sandler your line is now open brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good afternoon guys kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp hey brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co just wanted to stick with some questions around amerihome just kind of curious how much the change and increase in loan guidance is related to you guys retaining more production from amerihome and what and if so does that have any impact on kind of what amerihome would contribute on a standalone basis going forward or is it all kind of interconnected kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp well so i mean our kind of our core number i wouldnt say is amerihome dependent i mean weve been buying mortgages from other sources that was it happened in the first quarter and last year what amerihome gives us is a more profitable way to do that rather than going to other parties we can kind of keep it all in the family and also kind of a ready full bore in terms of ability to do that so what were going to get from amerihome is also on top of that is to be able to again kind of rightsize our loantodeposit ratio in a way thats certainly accretive to net interest income brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co yeah i guess maybe ask differently dale is are the two sort of exclusive of one another youre increasing loan guidance but then you still think amerihome can contribute what it was going to when you initially announced this back in february western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah we increased our loan guidance irrespective of amerihome that is that we all of last year we certainly didnt have amerihome and we were in a pandemic and never once were we under billion so its in part acknowledgement of that so we can do this without amerihome but amerihome gives us i dont know more confidence to be able to execute a better price point for the residential real estate we pick up theyre going to be expanding their product line thats going to give us kind of even more volume so were amerihome doesnt affect billion to billion if thats kind of what youre getting at brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co yeah yeah got it got it thats helpful and then i know when you announce the deal you your intention was to sell some of the msrs did this come in line with about what you were thinking and sort of how does that impact kind of their run rate in terms of gain on loan sale margin going forward kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah this is ken we actually sold the msrs for more money than we had anticipated so we feel good about that in terms of the transaction by getting these getting this large amount off our books allows us to do smaller msr transactions going forward which we think we should get better a better pricing on brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co okay great thank you guys operator thank you your next question is from the line of chris mcgratty from kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks good afternoon dale i wondered if you can parse out the billion of deposit growth by your verticals specifically tech and innovation hoa and kind of mortgage dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so the hoa group was up about kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp ill take that dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp okay western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp and so the regions all ended about billion all right warehouse lending did about billion tech and innovation is about million our hoa business just under million by the way hoa did as much in this quarter as it did almost all of last year so those are the big drivers of hoa of deposit growth chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp or i should just add im sorry theres a couple of things in there too which were excited about we never give you the names of our two deposit businesses but our deposit business one grew million in  and deposit business two which we always said was well behind deposit business number one grew million so were getting excited about what these businesses can do for us christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay its great color in terms of the ci growth can you maybe i missed in your prepared remarks did you i know the last quarter you said that your guidance was inclusive of growth in the warehouse but did you tell us what the warehouse balance changes were in the commercial book kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp are you asking im not certain of your question ask it again christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc sure the mortgage warehouse and how much of that is in the lending side how much of the growth this quarter was warehouse kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay all right the warehouse lending this quarter and we include three items in there we include warehouse lending msr lending and our note finance which is a separate business but we have it on the warehouse lending that collectively grew million for this quarter and we came in with an understanding this year that we keep warehouse lending basically flat to its ending balance of but we keep telling you we keep winning share there and it manifests itself here in  as you can see christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you very much operator thank you the next is gary tenner from da davidson please go ahead western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co thanks good morning just a couple of questions one just kind of housekeeping on ppp can you give us what the average loans outstanding were for the quarter dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp we have about billion in loans remaining ph with including two of course gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co right got you okay in terms of as youre kind of thinking forward and knowing that obviously adding more resi mortgage will change this but can you kind of just run through from a loan sensitivity perspective what amount of your loans are variable rate today and kind of status within the money floors as we start thinking a little further out to prospective rate actions dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so today the floors are active in the preponderance of our portfolio so we are were behaving as if were fixed we have i think an interesting asymmetrical profile whereby if rates go lower we see very little contraction of net interest income because ph the rest is floors but if rates rise our loan yields become even more asset sensitive because theyll be lifting off of the floors kind of going forward so its an asymmetrical benefit for us relative to where we are so we yeah of our book today is behaving as if its fixed rate gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co okay thats just in terms of if there is is it one rate hike two rate hikes until theres an actual upward benefit in those variable rate loan yields dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i mean its staggered some are immediate they are kind of others are basis points away so i would say on average youre going to need to see probably two rate increases before youre going to start seeing kind of notable improvement in terms of loan yields kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay even though all these loans are variable were putting them on at the floor so theyre looking like theyre fixed rate loans today gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co okay right and then just last question you talked about mortgage warehouse and continuing to win business there and taking share and obviously the warehouse deposit balances grew pretty significantly could you just talk about the kind of sensitivity of mortgage warehouse related deposits relative to overall volume overall mortgage volume western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so warehouse lending i think started out years ago it was an interesting idea and we see if we can get another channel going to something today where its just a very important strategic weapon for us its delivering more in deposits than we anticipated because primarily of the service we deliver and the fact that we moved upscale audio gap upmarket in dealing with some of the larger more sophisticated clients they are feeling more comfortable consolidating more and more of their deposits with us all right and theres some of the large clients there is a disproportion between we have much more in deposits than we have in their loan balances but were continuing to gain share in both the loan side and the deposit side i just would say that some of the competitors that we normally see are just not performing as well as they should in terms of service levels and weve got i think i said this maybe at the last earnings call if you think of us as an airport weve got planes circling overhead looking to land and give us their business and for us its a matter of how quickly we can onboard both the deposit and the loan business dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i think its important to note to remember that deposit balances arent really the business so its not operating accounts from these so lets say the refi business contracts dramatically that can affect the actual balances of the enterprise but that is a very small piece of the deposit balances we have indiscernible balances we have that drive that number is the escrow relationships and thats based upon the mortgage servicing that some of these enterprises own so you can see volatility in the origination side but the msrs drive the deposit balances and that tends to be much more stable as because people maintain mortgages on their houses gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co great thank you operator thank you your next question is from the line of timur braziler from wells fargo your line is now open timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning maybe just following up on that last mortgage warehouse discussion i guess how sensitive is that business to steepening yield curve and if broader industry trends start to slow down would the circling runway is that kind of irrespective of whats happening industry wide as you onboard new clients or if there is a broader slowdown we should expect to see volumes and growth rates low as well at western alliance kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so good question there when we came into in the planning year for our overall growth we did not have warehouse lending stepping up in terms of balances but obviously we had a good first quarter and were going to continue that trend going into quarters two three and four what were seeing is two things one theres just a natural rise in terms of taking market share with the clientele we have today and then on top of that we will get a benefit from penetrating the amerihome client list so theyve got as i said clients weve got about a western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 or so that overlap and were going to be able to penetrate going into their clients so if you can picture that we go into one of the amerihome clients and say look were willing we give you a line of credit just call it million for arguments sake and well also buy after you accumulate loans on that line well also take you out of that line thats a very powerful argument to offer sort of a two for one opportunity to the amerihome clients so we havent fully factored that into our numbers yet but that gives us some confidence that we should be able to continue to grow our warehouse lending business on the loan side timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful so as we start thinking about your new loan growth guidance it shouldnt just be what youve been putting on existing plus the rest of the increase guide coming directly from indiscernible we can actually see mortgage warehouse continue to ramp higher and the larger component of that growth indiscernible kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp well i just want to clarify what you said these billion to billion is basically business as we do it today all right so youll see already more purchases continue and youll see more our funding growth as if we never had the amerihome acquisition the amerihome acquisition as we ramped it up will provide either comfort to achieving that billion to billion or if we do it really well it will help us succeed that number timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful thank you on the residential side i think in quarters past you guys have talked about the concentration of do you have a concentration limit in mind and i guess as were building out what residential loan growth could look like how big of the overall loan portfolio can we envision that becoming dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well i think we can easily punch through i mean the average bank our size is first republic is just under so i mean what we like about the space is i mean its very good quality performance now weve got kind of an unlimited channel into that some other kind of crosssell opportunity some of which weve talked about that we can pick up so were definitely going through and toward the median at least for now kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thats a very strong book we have right fico dti of about between and below ltv we could probably give you a list of all the folks that have been gone 90day delinquent its usually just an unusual event and weve not had a loss in the book so it really helps to bring a lot of asset quality to good asset quality to our loan composition timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you and then just last one for me back on the deposit side im wondering how much of the growth if any is coming from the extension of the tax deadline and what that could look like for balances as customers go to pay tax bills in the next ph month or so western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah thats more of a consumer phenomenon i would say and our liquidities have been coming in strong all through remember we did billion of liquidity which far far exceeded our best best year ever and this quarter we did billion which just in one quarter timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator thank you the next question is from the line of david chiaverini from wedbush securities please go ahead david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks i wanted to ask about the pace of securities purchases you had a strong ramp up in the first quarter going forward should we expect that pace to slow somewhat as you pay down debt with the closing of amerihome dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yes it will absolutely slow what we did is weve been sitting on a lot of growth from the fourth quarter also the first quarter and so we wanted to deploy some of that again the balancing act were trying to do is look we can get basis points if we keep it at the fed thats pretty meaningless we can get if we can put it out into low ltv home loans or we can go into the securities book and as i said weve got so its a little bit of a compromise there because it is going to take us sometime late within this year but sometime to deploy the liquidity that we have and also the new deposit growth that we expected continue to generate so but over time yeah i think our securities book can actually bleed down but i wouldnt expect to see that anytime soon but no i think the growth in the book and the security side is largely behind us were using our current liquidity to pay off all of the amerihome debt and then also to begin to purchase nonqm mortgages through that channel david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc great thats helpful and i also wanted to follow up on the nim commentary you mentioned about how the drag should moderate going forward and i see in the slide deck how the spot rate on loans is about basis points lower than the portfolio average in the quarter in terms of magnitude of being down well i guess the clarification is to expect continued margin compression but just not clearly as much as the basis points in the first quarter is that the way to think about it dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i mean again were focused on is were focused on how do we increase the earning power of the company and translate that into eps margin has very little to do with that so brain power we think hey low western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 cost stable core deposits that we can deploy into profitable assets now gosh id love to get for that without risk were not seeing those opportunities at scale at that price point so what are we doing well were going to residential where we have unlimited and thats two points less but if i add mortgage loans at and our margins at thats going to decrement that margin a little bit but instead if i think about it ive got investments at basis points indiscernible thats already on the books and i can put that out at basis points that would help the margin even though that spread is actually lower because ill take it from basis points to basis points so the combination of those two things is it possible the margin comes down a little bit yeah i think that would actually be likely a good thing because what it really means is that were continuing to move the fundamental footings of the balance sheet that we can then deploy into earning assets kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp and so i want to add one other thing to what dale said our focus on net interest income rather than nim started in early so this is not a new phenomenon for us we have talked about this since the early part of that this was the direction that were going to take which is prioritize net interest income growth over nim simply said net interest income is going to drive eps one of the things im very proud of this quarter was two less days we made more in net interest income than we made in  so our strategy is being executed upon and dale said our goal is to keep that net interest income looking robust for the next several quarters as we continue to deploy the excess liquidity and continue to upgrade our guidance as to what were going to bring in david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc that all makes sense and then a last housekeeping item i think you mentioned merger charges youre expecting million roughly million mostly in the second quarter is your expectation now that its going to be in total lower than the million that was discussed at the announcement of amerihome dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yes ken was alluding to that earlier in terms of the pricing that we got on the disposition of the msr book i mean the preponderance of those fees that were going to be incurring are basically deconversion costs from our outsourced mortgage servicer to the purchaser that transaction you close within the next few weeks david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks very much operator thank you the next is michael young from truist your line is now open michael young q analyst truist securities inc thanks good morning western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning michael young q analyst truist securities inc i wanted to follow up ken on your comments about the reserve level maybe maintaining more of a flat level going forward is that sort of on a relative basis to loans outstanding in other words i guess cecl impacts maybe more muted and loan growth coming more from commercial going forwards or kind of stay more stable kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp that was really its a numerator and denominator thing what i was trying to say is the balance is going to stay relatively flat with the way were growing you can see the ratio drop but the balance we think will be relatively flat a lot of that as you know with cecl is just driven by the economic outlook which we can really move the numbers but what should not be lost upon are our shareholders investors the analyst community is that of our portfolio is in loans or asset categories that weve never ever had a loss on or loss in i should say and thats what also drives the cecl calculation michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay great and maybe just as a followup just thinking about the pace of growth relative to capital capital levels gotten a little skinny even with the issuance this quarter i know ppp kind of has an impact on the pce ratio but just we think about you guys are willing to grow if growth is there and youll raise capital as needed or would you tamper some of the mortgage growth areas that may be more of a flex area on the balance sheet to stay within kind of capital ratios kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp no if we need capital to grow i think you can look for us to do the right thing and raise capital michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay and if i can sneak in one last one just with amerihome kind of on the books i guess now ken just trying to think about sort of the buy versus build equation going forward you guys always have some deposit loan growth verticals in the pipeline that youre building but has this changed your view on that equation or what youd like to do on a goforward basis kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp no not at all i mean the amerihome team has a couple of things that they would like to look at in terms of new opportunities and i mentioned them nonqm channel jumbo channel are just two of them that jump right out but thats separate that team can work on that as the commercial side of western alliance can work on other business opportunities and were continuing to work on those opportunities now and were probably one of the few banks that is sitting here working on 2022s growth levels thats how far out we are in what we think in terms of our pipeline and our visibility western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 michael young q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks operator thank you your next question is from tim coffey from janney please go ahead timothy coffey q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thank you gentlemen so in the quarter residential mortgages were about of our net loan growth would you expect it to be that level going forward dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah yes i think thats going to continue and as i mentioned thats kind of the core piece i think is not a bad number when we sop up our excess liquidity its going to skew much higher than that because a lot of that is going to be directly toward mortgage acquisitions is where we see something kind of well in excess of billion timothy coffey q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay and on the efficiency ratio is kind of you think as we go given the growth this past quarter and as you go through the year adding amerihome and such do you think is going to become a new level for you dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah its going to be 46ish or something in there but yeah mid i think thats kind of where its fairly stable at that level something under for sure timothy coffey q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay and can you talk a little bit about what it is about western alliance that allows you to maintain kind of expense growth at a level well below asset growth kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so let me try that i think a lot of that when we talk about our national commercial business line strategy we generally talk about it in terms of the growth that it brings in and thats very helpful to keeping the efficiency ratio low but these businesses are for the most part have very very high operating leverage and thats one of the characteristics there are several characteristics of the national strategy generally very few competitors pricing power or stability great asset quality and then the fourth one we love is very high operating leverage and as the growth shifts over to that coming from those national business lines just the natural calculation of the efficiency ratio will keep us more moderate as compared to our peer group the other thing is were just growing revenues as i said upfront four times faster than expenses and that too well keep the efficiency ratio in line western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 timothy coffey q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay great those are my questions thank you very much kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thank you operator thank you the next question is from jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets your line is now open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning everyone kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey dale question for you can you go back and review the loantodeposit comments you made earlier and where you think you might sit at the end of the second quarter and maybe end of the year can you help us with that a bit dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so well so i mean its something were trying to get underway now i think that at the end of the second quarter i expect we maybe will be close to where we are presently maybe a little bit better with the billion billion in growth of each i think were going to be able to get these kind of new products out with amerihome maybe by the end of the second quarter into the third and then ph would they see billions of dollars certainly in volume and so we can move rapidly on that i personally would like to be kind of at the range back to loantodeposit ratio at the end of the year and so i mean if you take where we are where we rightsize that where we have very substantial growth from just where we are as of we had billion of loan growth at a spread thats already in the books as of that generates about nearly million a month of increased ppnr just from deploying that out of liquidity then you add in amerihome with this we expect to be at an eps run rate of as we exit jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc i was going to ask later indiscernible western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp i just want to punctuate what dale said for a moment there jon everyones talking about the liquidity and loan deposit ratio were talking about net interest margin versus net interest income what dale just said is the crux of how we structured the business that the billion that we just put out and the million that were making a month pretax million a quarter that is very very powerful and thats what leads us to have a certain degree of confidence along with the amerihome acquisition that we can exit the year at that eps run rate jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay i was going to ask if you think numbers should go up but you answered that for me i do want to ask one more question and it wont be on deposits but could you talk about lending outside of your national businesses some of the pipeline trends and what youre seeing in construction just as a kind of a gut check on what youre thinking on the overall economy kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so actually what were seeing inside of our footprint is exactly what were seeing outside of our footprint so on the construction side residential thats very hot for us at this moment homes take five to seven months to build theyre extending out a little bit longer than that because of some labor shortages and so the cost is a little bit higher but once theyre built boom theyre sold rather quickly so one of our struggles of course is how you keep those really good loans outstanding for a longer period of time but the construction site single family residences are really hot buildtorent opportunities which for us are mostly in our footprint more so than outside of our footprint arizona seems to be buildtorent capital the outskirts of phoenix and the west valley seems to be very very active and were doing a number of deals there im going to let our chief credit officer whos been sitting here patiently and hasnt said a word tim bruckner tim do you want to comment on this timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp sure residential and commercial i think there were definitely some things that sat on the shelf last year with the uncertainties of the pandemic so projects delayed so were seeing that move forward and so we as we look out across we dont see any big shifts in loan demand we see stability across the major ph hoa groups within our real estate portfolio so were not seeing trends in rent payments that are alarming were seeing things that give us comfort and were maintaining a very close and direct monthly or weekly dialogue even with our borrowers it gives us that information so i think outlook is very very positive for us across all the segments real estate as well as residential kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp and were very active in the net migration in states as you would expect as theyre seeing even more activity but i should have said it does not only pertains to construction of singlefamily residences but on the industrial side we started finance the number of spec projects for industrial warehouses and before the show is even completed they are already leased up and no longer are they spec theyre all preleased so that give you an example of how hot the cre market is for us western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16apr2021 timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp yes just a data point on that that portfolio is stabilizing and has stabilized faster now than at any time in the past four years our portfolio so it is moving very quickly kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp jon we didnt have time to give you a short answer we hope the long one jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc no thats fine and i guess just the one thing you did flag this and i want to make sure its out there but you did say youre expecting some movement in special mention and classified but it doesnt sound like youre concerned about it at all kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp the answer the short answer is yes weve looked around we dont see anything on the horizon thats going to give us a little bit of trouble and we feel good about where the asset quality is jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i will turn the call over back to mr ken vecchione kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thank you thanks to everyone for dialing in and listening to our story were feeling very good about it we are very proud of the results and we look forward to talking to days from now about the second quarter thanks again and everyone enjoy their weekend operator this concludes todays
