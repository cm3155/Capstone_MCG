sitting alongside of me tim bruckner our chief credit officer is also here today as well so we had solid performance this quarter as the company passed the billion asset milestone and were excited by the business opportunities before us for the first quarter wal generated total net revenues of million net income of million and eps of we remain one of the most profitable banks in the industry with return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity of and respectively which will continue to support capital accumulation and strong capital levels in the quarters to come balance sheet expansion continued with quarterly loan growth of billion or annualized and deposits rose by billion or annualized as we continue to effectively attract and deploy liquidity excluding ppp runoff loans grew billion in the first quarter with residential loans increasing billion healthy commercial loan demand continued but this quarter witnessed seasonal runoff of our warehouse lending loans by million caused by mortgage supply constraints associated with lower inventories industrywide western alliance diverse loan drivers continue to propel growth in the regional banking division up million tech and innovation up million and hotel franchise finance up million the flexibility of our national commercial bank franchise provides material opportunities to grow both sides of the balance sheet and in the event of an economic slowdown allows for alternative growth avenues by product and geographic mix unlike many of our competitors western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 asset quality continues to remain stable as total nonperforming assets modestly increased million to basis points of total assets and net chargeoffs were only as the economic environment continues to evolve we believe that our deliberate strategy to responsibly grow the national business lines where we possess specialized sector and underwriting expertise and in low to no loss loan categories which now comprise of total loans will allow us to maintain a superior credit risk profile to the overall commercial banking sector regarding amerihome mortgage banking revenue increased million quarterly to million as gain on sale margin compression and lower production volumes were offset by a rise in loan servicing revenue as discussed at the time of acquisition the natural macro hedge between servicing income rising msr valuations and declining gain on sale margins was on display this quarter additionally amh continues to unlock value as an emerging commercial bank leveraging our ability to efficiently deploy liquidity into low credit risk heldforinvestment assets with attractive yields amerihome continues to demonstrate the unique opportunities to unlock value as a bankowned mortgage business such as billion in low cost custodial deposits billion in ebo loan purchases million in warehouse referral loans already generated to date and residential loans purchased through their correspondent loan business these opportunities drive additional value for amerihome that cannot be matched by other standalone mortgage companies dale will now take you through the financial performance dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp for the quarter western alliance generated net income of million eps of and preprovision net revenue of million total net revenue of million has increased yearoveryear but declined million during the quarter primarily due to certain noninterest income items net interest income modestly declined million during the quarter to million as strong held for investment loan growth of billion was impacted by two fewer business days in the quarter and interest expense on our credit linked notes issued in late december overall noninterest income increased sic decreased million to million from the prior quarter driven primarily by million marktomarket losses on equity securities and a smaller benefit from credit guarantees of million from the prior quarter which was partially offset by a gain on sale of municipal investment securities as ken noted mortgage bankingrelated income increased million quarterly as lower production volume and a decline in net gain on loans originated and sold was offset by a rise in loan servicing revenue as rising interest rates and falling prepayment speeds benefit msr valuations net of hedges and servicing income gain on sales revenue fell by half to million while servicing revenue jumped to million mortgage prepayment speeds fell as new mortgage rates rose at the fastest rate in ph years making refinancing uneconomic and thereby extending the lines of our servicing assets this is the natural hedge of the mortgage business and why we manage the business for total mortgage revenue if we had rapidly increased the value of our servicing rights we manufactured in the quarter we would have booked a higher gain on sale and lower servicing income in lockstep finally noninterest expense increased million in the quarter resulting in an efficiency ratio of  expenses have historically run modestly higher and we expect this is the high watermark for this ratio and declining in western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 turning to our net interest drivers investment yields increased basis points from the prior quarter to as rates rose and as prepayments fell on residential mortgagebacked securities reducing purchase price premium amortization near quarterend through the securities sales and reinvesting we moved over billion in securities to repricing beta without a give up in yield that will increase sensitivity in the current quarter on a linkedquarter basis loan yields declined basis points driven by a greater proportion of residential loans and lower prepayment and ppp fees yields on loans held for sale benefited from rising mortgage rates and increased basis points to the end of quarter spot rate for hfs loans was total cost of funds increased by basis points from the prior quarter to primarily due to the credit linked notes transactions entered into in december demonstrating the strength of our deposit franchise to raise low cost the key sources of funding interestbearing deposit costs remained fairly flat at basis points while the balances grew billion during the quarter net interest income of million was higher yearoveryear but declined slightly from the prior quarter overall average earning assets increased billion or annualized net interest margin was relatively stable at down basis point from the prior quarter as our strong deposit growth led to a greater proportion of earnings assets being held in cash and lower loan yields due to residential loan growth this excess cash provides us with optionality to deploy into higher yielding loans in future periods after the recent basis point move by the fed our asset sensitivity has increased from last quarter driven by increased liquidity as deposit growth exceeded loan growth by billion and variable rate loans moved above their floors in a rate shock scenario of plus basis points over for the next months and on a static balance sheet net interest income is expected to rise using the same scenario on a growth balance sheet we expect net interest income to grow over over the base rate and to a basis point rate shock scenario on a static balance sheet net interest income is expected to rise and a multiple of this impact when balance sheet growth expectations are also incorporated given our first quarter net interest income run rate of million or billion per year we should see at least a increase in net interest income in the shock plus bps scenario or million annually which the market projects will see on an accelerated rate increase trajectory later this year an important driver of this projected increase in net interest income is due to moving off of our rate floors the rate floor schedule shows that of our loans will be off their floor with a basis point increase in rates which should happen by the second fomc meeting to be held in midjune and they become completely irrelevant in the third quarter i would note that these floors served us well to sustaining netinterest income for two years during the pandemic our efficiency ratio increased to from in  as certain seasonal expenses outpaced net revenue growth noninterest expense rose million from the last quarter due to lower loan origination cost deferrals and higher seasonal expenses in  again at we believe the efficiency ratio will decrease through successive quarters this year preprovision net revenue was million for the quarter a increase from the same period last year this resulted in a ppnr roa of a decline of basis points compared to last quarter primarily driven by balance sheet growth outpacing ppnr this continued strong performance and leading capital generation provides us with significant flexibility to fund ongoing balance sheet growth manage capital actions and meet credit demand balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans held for investment increased billion or to billion and deposit growth of billion brought balances to billion at quarter end mortgage servicing western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 rates balances grew million in the quarter to million as no msr sales were completed during  as we expect this asset will continue to benefit from a rising rate environment goodwill and intangibles increased million primarily due to our acquisition of digital disbursements in january tangible book value per share decreased or over the prior quarter to primarily due to fair value losses on available for sale securities recorded in all other comprehensive income tangible book value increased over the prior year we continue to generate consistent organic loan growth from our national commercial business strategy and are seeing balanced demand between regional banking divisions and national business lines loans held for investment grew billion in the quarter with continued strong growth in residential real estate however drivers of loan growth this quarter in particular net ci growth was negatively impacted by million in ppp loan payoffs and a million decline in mortgage warehouse balances where lower housing inventory or higher rates held back the typical seasonal upturn in purchased home volume given current pipeline strength especially a note finance and msr lending businesses where the team is onboarding new amerihome clients we still expect mortgage warehouse balances in aggregate to be flat yearoveryear for mortgage warehouse has already rebounded million quarter to date ci growth benefited from healthy contributions of our regional banking divisions of million and other national business lines of million especially in tech and innovation restaurant franchise demands cre investor and construction and land also contributed million and million of net loan growth respectively our national commercial franchise provides optionality to deploy liquidity by business mix and geography turning to deposits we continue to see broad base core deposit growth across our diversified channels that will generate stable low cost funding in different rate environments deposits grew billion or annualized in the first quarter driven by increases in noninterest bearing dda of billion interestbearing dda of billion and savings and money market of billion these were partially offset by a decrease in the most expensive category cds million noninterest bearing ddas comprised of our total deposit mix our specialty deposit franchise continue to provide ample opportunities to generate attractive funding to support loan growth with deposits from hoa up by million settlement services increased million and tech and innovation up by million settlement services have successfully incorporated digital disbursements into the franchise and has already begun benefiting from synergies through expanded relationships and new affiliations with claims administrators and law firms our asset quality continues to remain stable and total classified assets and special mention loans as a percentage of total loans are lower than they were in as the economic environment continues to evolve we believe our deliberate strategy to responsibly grow national business lines where we possess specialized sector and underwriting expertise in a low to no loss categories which now compose of total loans will allow us to maintain superior credit risk profile to the overall commercial banking sector special mention loans remain relatively stable on a proportion of total funded loans at basis points total classified assets rose million in  to million or basis points to total assets due to the temporary impact of the omicron variant quarterly net losses were negligible for the first quarter our total loan acl increased million from the prior quarter to million as the provision exceeded losses in all total loan acl for funded loans declined basis point to at quarter end adjusting

corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 given our industry leading return on equity and assets we continue to generate significant capital to fund organic growth and maintain wellcapitalized regulatory ratios our tangible common equity to total assets of was bolstered by net income and million shares issued at million in proceeds under the atm but also affected this quarter by negative fair value marks on available for sale debt securities our cet1 ratio was essentially flat at inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend of per share our tangible book value per share declined to primarily reflecting the adverse afs market quarter end while rates have continued to rise in april the rate of increase we witnessed in the term structure in the first quarter of the yield curve should subside later this year given our robust capital generation we still expect that will again be a year of tangible book value growth ill now hand the call back to ken to conclude with closing comments kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp i was very pleased with  results and the management teams ability to adapt to the changing interest rate in economic environments loan growth was strong deposits grew more than double that amount credit remains solid and clean expenses are balanced for both nearterm efficiency and longterm investments and net interest income sensitivity increased as variable rate loans are projected to rise above their floors amerihomes first quarter results remain consistent with our overall pro forma guidance that we gave at the time of acquisition which was and we are tracking above this the composition of that performance is more skewed towards net interest income which is consistent with our expectations but more pronounced with rising rates deposit growth and loan growth from amerihome have both exceeded our expectations and taking on greater significance in this rapidly rising rate environment going forward we expect mortgage banking revenues to be in line with  levels and any disruption to this may be made up with balance sheet growth for the remainder of the year we continue to support our fullyear eps for loan and deposit growth expectations remain at billion per quarter with a bias to the upside our loan and deposit pipeline bolstered by client confidence gives us reassurance that our balance sheet will continue to grow in a safe sound and thoughtful manner we have modeled six rate hikes in starting with basis points in may and then basis points in june july september and december admittedly this is conservative net interest margin is expected to grow throughout the year lifting net interest income sequentially as loan growth provides incremental revenue support net interest income sensitivity has climbed substantially from the prior quarter it is our expectation based upon the projected forward yield curve that nearly all of our variable rate loans with floors will be in the money next quarter further giving support to ppnr progressively increasing throughout the year as our efficiency ratio declines the bank asset quality remains solid weve not seen emerging delinquencies or defaults within any segment our base economic model is for a slowdown but not a recession and then lastly capital we believe our internal capital generation can support up to billion of loan growth without returning to the equity markets at this time dale tim and i would be happy to take your questions western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 question and answer section operator thank you we will now open up the lines for questions operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala from bank of america your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hey good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch i guess maybe ken dale just going back to your earnings outlook for unchanged from last quarter just talk to us around how the trajectory of nii as you mentioned right i think the markets pricing in maybe a basis points hike in may june so you should have meaningfully more rate sensitivity on the asset side coming up for the back half of the year just wondering dale if the forward curve plays out as expected what does that mean in terms of yearoveryear nii growth and whats the offset in terms of why your eps outlook didnt change and move higher is it just because youre assuming lower mortgage earnings so i would appreciate if you can address both dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so i think as ken mentioned he gave the rate scenario that basically reconciles to the what we show on slide is a more accelerated rate path which is perhaps more in line with what expectations are from the fomc actions so between both of those we can get to based upon a more gentle rate path forward than maybe what well see kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah im pretty optimistic about what youre going to see in the next three quarters in terms of net interest income growth and i think its going to be some of the largest quarteroverquarter increases that this company has posted organically in its history and so yeah you could say that the again i keep telling you the is the floor is what we said last quarter and we feel very comfortable with the and well go from there and were going to update well update in the middle of the year our eps guidance ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 got it and a followup dale just talk to us around one my sense is you expect deposit growth so the level of deposit growth and what youre assuming in terms of deposit betas as we go through the rate hikes and just mix shift moving from nib to interestbearing dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so our deposit betas ran in the on money market accounts last time we think were going to be in that same area this time around interestbearing checking is about points lower than that again we think that thats probably going to be somewhat similar i can make arguments for why it could be more accelerated but then with liquidity away it could actually be a little bit lower than that regarding earnings ecrs those were in the range last time we think those are likely to be accelerated in terms of what were looking at but even from there even going into the we think that again you can see that with a lot of our loan book variable that that is going to have a yawning yield relative to a more muted expansion of cost structure kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp let me just add a couple of points there to dale one we kind of feel our geographic and product and national business segments provide growth through diversified channels and thats again what gives us a great deal of comfort to say deposit growth billion floor and as you can see what we just did this quarter we feel very comfortable with the billion we also feel very comfortable that amerihome continues to attract and bring in deposit growth which we always expected and youre seeing that as well as it relates to maybe deposit pricing pressure near term thats been relatively muted for us and only a handful of clients have been looking to recalibrate their pricing and i think dale might have said this on the last call but were going to hold back repricing deposits until many of our clients have gone past their floors and were trying to link those two together so just a little more color on the deposits for you ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it ill requeue thanks for taking my questions operator your next question comes from the line of casey haire from jefferies your line is open casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning everyone dale had a question on the efficiency ratio youre talking about it being the high watermark here in this quarter with gain on sale flat what does that mean i mean because the msr reval if we strip that out that would obviously launch it higher so in the high so what are the steps to get that efficiency ratio back to that low besides a stable gain on sale if you can just give some color there thatd be helpful dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 well so we i mean its going to be much more muted growth relative to the revenue line so as we indicated we have a lot of kind of first quarter charges this has always been the case kind of stepping out in terms of incentives rewards just general compensation all those reviews are effective in february fas costs were also deferrals were lower in  we dont have much of a deferral when loan growth comes from residential we expect a broadening out in terms of loan growth activity in  and beyond and that will result in more deferrals of those costs kind of going forward so i mean seasonally i think you can see this as well its a little murky for because in the second quarter is when we acquired amerihome and amerihome had an efficiency ratio in the at so pulling that in pulled us up a little bit i think its notable that we brought them in and our efficiency ratio on a combined basis is where it was before we acquired amerihome on a standalone kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp casey the simple calculus is that we expect net interest income growth total revenue growth to grow at a much faster multiple than expense growth and so while we manage our efficiency towards the low range we are also mindful of all the investments that we need to make in this company and we are doing that in order to become a billion company unimpeded so we continue to invest in risk management and technology we have people new hires the education and the training of the recently hired we continued to build out and improve settlement services and business escrow services and these two businesses present great opportunities for us to increase franchise value and it also carries with it a low cost funding so weve got that going on plus several new initiatives in the loan and deposit areas which we hope will help us towards and then weve also looked selectively at regional expansion and new business development hires so thats all embedded into that efficiency ratio and the fact that the revenues are growing at a ill say geometric pace versus the expenses that are growing more asymmetrically allows us to lower the expense efficiency ratio for the year while simultaneously making all the investments we need for the out years so were in a good position doing that casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good and just followingup on the loan growth the broadening out in the more traditional ci you guys have talked about a cap on resi if the commercial side comes in a little lighter is that cap on resi still a hard cap or could you potentially take that higher dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah let me describe it i mean i think we saw that as more of a benchmark guidepost or whatever someplace to kind of reflect and what that reflection is going to consider is where do we see our capital position where do we see our interest rate risk profile what opportunities are going to be in front of us in terms of other credit opportunities so i could see us going through so long as all those other criteria are met and i think thats the case this time i think its notable so in the first quarter yeah we did put on billion of residential and those are basically year fixed rate mortgages but that was matched by a little over billion of noninterest bearing dda on top of that we had another billion of deposit growth in deposit types with betas in the and that is now either sitting in western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 increased betas on what we did in our securities book or in cash again poised to take advantage of a higher rate environment which we think is imminent casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good just last one for me the cash it launch i think you guys talked about that last quarter being starting up this in early just wondering if some updated thoughts there and if you could any visibility on what kind of deposit balances that might generate kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah its in beta testing weve brought in a few clients and were working on it and what we do with all our national business lines is we put it through beta testing and were slow to roll out but once we feel comfortable we then put our foot down on the accelerator and so were not there yet and so any of our deposit growth projections do not have anything coming from this initiative and as we get more comfortable the initiative will provide more details as we go forward throughout the year casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brock vandervliet from ubs your line is open brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everybody thanks for questions kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc lets see did i miss it what was the msr fair value market dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so we had msr or servicing revenue was million in the first quarter its been lower in the fourth quarter and other periods and i think if you look at our balance of million and what would be an expected return just on servicing alone that would have been about million so were saying million was kind of normalized what we didnt do is we were maybe a little slower to increase the value of the servicing rights we were creating as we bought aggregated and presented loans to the gses we did this because we thought it was actually going to be increasing in value in the fourth quarter and we didnt see that and i think weve talked about this before brock but initially what happened was even though rates were rising and you would typically see an extension of cpr lives it was a little bit like ill call it last call where everyone said western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 ive got to get in and get my refi done in time well now that market has dramatically changed refi business is i think all but over and as a result weve seen this significant extension so if we had done that earlier what we would have had in the first quarter earnings instead of showing million of servicing revenue and million of gain on sale that number the gain on sale number would have been higher and the servicing revenue would have been down and i put that our core earning rate was million million brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay lets unpack there so if i look at so one question is do you intend to build above the million level in msr or are you a seller going forward dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so i might note that we actually contracted to sell million of servicing rights in the second week of april and that would hold this basically flattish to the million level we do think that within certainly these lower coupons that theyre not going to get any better than they are and so liquidating them can make sense so i dont expect our msr number to change considerably from where we were kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah just to add that the sale of the msrs that we just did also came in at a higher valuation than what we marked the msr at the end of the quarter brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay yeah i guess were all struggling with what that line what mortgage revs could look like assuming for example a positive mark in  just because of where rates have risen and maybe a stable servicing number could you speak to that i know you give guidance that you expect mortgage revs to be relatively flat but just kind of boil that down a bit kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah let me speak to it a little bit and also take you back to our thought process at the acquisition so again we think the total mortgage servicing revenues thats how we look at it or banking revenues i should say are going to remain relatively flat which is at or near  levels as we go forward during the course of the year if those revenues should fall somewhat short we believe well be able to make that up in net interest income in the deposit growth we are seeing and the msr loan growth we expect during the course of the year coming from amerihome and the reason why i want to bring this up and bring you back to the acquisition is i think its real important to remember why we did the amerihome acquisition we didnt see it as a mortgage company that we bought for three multiple on a forward basis we wouldnt have bought amerihome for a three forward multiple that did not interest us but when we sat with their management team and we saw the number of revenue streams that could be created inside of the bank that could get a much higher multiple we really concluded that were buying a emerging bank at a three multiple and that got us very excited western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 and as you can see now as mortgage revenues in the industry are falling short on the production side because of volume and of course of compression on the margin side were one of the few mortgage companies that can actually are segments that can actually generate offsetting revenues coming from deposits and coming from loan growth and also being able to generate loans to go into our book held for investment to soak up this extra liquidity we have so just wanted to bring you back to why we did the deal and what we have a number of levers here and therefore we dont get hung up solely on the mortgage banking income dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp brock i mean i looked at where were going to see in terms of the rapid expansion of net interest income based upon the rate environment and the liquidity that ken mentioned and i do think that with a stable revenue from mortgage direct mortgage operations gain on sale and servicing revenue combined that number is going to continue to be dwarfed by what were going to see on net interest income for the combined bank including what we get from the enhanced deposit growth that weve had from amerihome buyers brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay got you i think more disclosure here would be super helpful so you get the credit that i think you should have for this business but ill step up indiscernible dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks operator your next question comes from the line of brad milsaps from piper sandler your line is open brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co dale i wanted to followup on the ecr deposits i think at last quarter they were around billion did that number remain relatively stable and will the cost of those deposits continue to manifest themselves in non interest expense as opposed to interest expense just curious if thats kind of where youre going to keep those going forward and i assume thats not part of your kind of new interest rate sensitivity guidance in those tables or is that included in there as well dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 yes to all three questions so it is about the same number approximately half of our dda is subject to these you know cash ecrs that number we think is going to be essentially kind of fairly stable going forward and know that the cost of that is not shown in our net interest income pickup as you indicated it doesnt show up but it will continue to show up in deposit costs in noninterest expense brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co and so you said those deposit betas are typically run in the dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp last time they ran in the but were projecting theyre going to be in the this time brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then just as my followup it feels like the loans heldforsale at least on average held in better maybe than you initially thought it sounds also like the spot rate is up fairly significantly can you kind of speak to that line item and kind of what you guys kind of foresee coming there as you kind of think about managing liquidity et cetera dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i think that balance is going to be fairly flat kind of going forward as you indicated it is very sensitive those things role every three or four weeks that rate was at the end of  and up from what the average was just in anticipation of rates rising you saw libor and other rates climbing along the way so yeah but that what we see right now is we saw our cash increase a little bit we do think were going to get a broader base and more significant loan quarter this quarter and well see i believe effective deployment of that brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co got it and just one more on the cash you kind of said previously you might wait to deploy some of that into the bond portfolio if in fact deposits do run ahead of loans until rates maybe stabilize or move higher is that still your thinking or just kind of curious have you changed your mind on the cash management dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so i mean you did say that our bond portfolio climbs in the first quarter that was mostly toward the end of the quarter brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co yes dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 its actually grown further this quarter already but those purchases have all been in basically aa securities repricing beta off of sofr and so we think that as youre going to see the duration of the securities book fall down a little bit here as well in  kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp the gain on sale that we took last quarter was well timed and weve taken an extra weve took the gain and then we took the liquidity and reinvested it for higher returns so we like that trade that we did brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great thank you guys ill hop back in queue kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brandon king from truist securities your line is open brandon king q analyst truist securities inc thank you i just wanted to get a little more clarification on activity analysis for nii im just curious what the growth balance sheet assumption for that was is it kind of assuming the billion in loans and deposit growth just wanted to clarify that dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well our internal growth assumptions are stronger than the floor that weve indicated were saying basically kind of at least billion on loans and deposits each and we think weve got kind of the pipelines and the products array to be able to do that i dont have a number to tell you but they are greater than that i think its notable that ken mentioned that we expect to be able to do this without having to touch the capital markets growing up to billion per quarter brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and then all that being said with the current interest rate environment and the forward curves is it possible to get a sub40 efficiency ratio by end of this year and especially next year kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah i wouldnt call for that we are dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 its not something we want if we have the efficiency ratio dropping and dropping well look to and efficiency ratio to me is just the exhaust fumes from the business and how we allocate our capital and liquidity and quite frankly we probably allocate i put more money into the expense line for other investment projects that we have on the board but have yet to begun to fund and so i think instead of getting it below we would take a longer time horizon which has served us very well in this company and look to continue to work on the growth projections for and thats how we would use the money brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thats helpful and then lastly could you give us update on the nonqm transition with amerihome and if you could quantify potentially any benefits for that this year and maybe next year dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so amerihome continues to generate nonqm and jumbo loans for us probably todays rates are in the area maybe a little more a little higher than that probably the last time we talked i think were saying they were doing about million a month theyre probably up to now a little over million a month and we expect that to continue to climb throughout the year brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks very much kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay operator and your next question comes from the line of gary tenner from da davidson your line is open gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning sorry to beat a dead horse on the mortgage question but as we look out to the second quarter and assuming the first quarter msr valuation adjustment was kind of maybe overstated maybe it was a bit of a catch up as dale you may have alluded to from fourth quarter and rates not moving up quite as much so if the valuation adjustment is lower this quarter could you just help me understand or maybe position what the offset would be on the mortgage banking line to kind of keep that number flat sequentially is it kind of volume driven or what are the other moving parts that are going to hold them flat dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i appreciate that no itd be rate driven on gain on sale so what happened is so we have independent third parties two of them that we go to and they value our mortgage book our servicing rights book and they were both indicated that we were low on our valuation and we also get broker quotes in there and so we raised that valuation and that resulted in late in the quarter a larger servicing revenue than would have otherwise been the case western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 now going into the second quarter we take these now higher basis points of value from msrs and we put them into basically the msr manufacturing model and so now when we do a deal and then we sell it to fannie or freddie were recognizing a larger gain on sale at the time and posting a larger mortgage servicing right and so now if we sell those msrs going forward were going to recognize a smaller gain so that number is going to be lower and in lockstep gain on sale revenue will be higher as ken indicated we did the sale already havent closed it it closes the next month for about of our mortgage servicing rights book at valuations above what we had marked them to so weve taken that again and said you know what theyre still low on valuation now that is into the machine that produces the value for msr valuations and gain on sale and so that is still higher again so youre going to see that gain on sale kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp hey not to beat a dead horse from this side if theres any disruption to our forecast about mortgage banking revenues itll be offset by the growth in net interest income that amerihome brings certainly the deposits and the loans they bring in this environment a higher rate environment will mute or offset any of the disruptions in the mortgage revenue lines if it occurs at all gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co right and i think we get that from a holistic perspective but obviously more difficult on our side to kind of pull out those parts if i can just ask one more question on the loans held for sale i thought i had recalled from last quarter that the kind of where the last quarters average was about where you wanted it so in terms of and youre saying now that where the quarter was this quarter is about right so im just curious if that was a change in your thought process because i assume you could have extended the dwell times a little bit to keep that average higher if you wanted to but just want to make sure im thinking about it correctly going forward dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so we had this we thought a pretty cool little trick whereby we could hold these loans longer and basically earn the coupon rate on the loan for what is effectively only a fourweek investment so instead of getting at the time basis points held the cash with the federal reserve were getting something north of i would just say that maybe somebody caught on to us and the pricing dynamics for that trade have changed and so were using it less gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay so where the balances are now is kind of the sweet spot dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 going forward okay thank you operator and your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan your line is open kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp hello operator steven steven your line is open our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom from rbc your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey yeah thanks good morning guys kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp hey jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc just a couple of questions here this is a crazy question can you talk a little bit about regional banking and whats going on there in terms of loan growth kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp a little bit harder for us to do that and the reason why is a lot of our competition for new clients we go up against the large regionals and the money center banks and we like doing that and more times than not we can win that with a higher price and greater service but a lot of small regionals we dont see theyre not really competing against us as much or were not competing against them average loan sizes for us have risen and as we moved upscale to be with stronger or more liquid clients weve just kind of left some of the regional banking in the dust the only place we really see them is a little bit in our metro ci book well run into them but thats not a huge growing book of business for us jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay so if it feels healthy you feels like you can take share there kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 okay dale a question for you this is kind of the opposite of the question i asked last quarter but would you guys talk about the eps plus eps guide last quarter i asked you about what it means for the first quarter but if you reverse that it suggests an exit rate thats or higher for the year i guess the question is are you blushing that kind of an exit rate for the year which makes us more comfortable for dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah yeah i think thats like you said i think that your area is where youre going to end up to do that and with the rate sensitivity the rate rises that were are i think right in front of us we get there jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and under that scenario i think you touched on it it sounds like youre saying mortgage fee revenues are probably under of total dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i mean i think thats where that would end up is also jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay and then just one other question ken youve alluded to this but it sounds like despite maybe a hostile rate environment for mortgage youre saying that the accretion numbers the earnings numbers that you laid out when you did amerihome about a year ago its maybe the geography is different but theyre still valid is that what youre trying to say kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah thats exactly jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay thanks guys i appreciate it kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of timur braziler from wells fargo your line is open timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc looking at the cost structure for amerihome is it based on kind of total added revenues to the bank or is there a component of variable comp to the gain on sale revenues and indiscernible kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp you faded out there a little bit but i think i got the gist are we adding a cost structure to amerihome for producing the banking related traditional banking related net interest income the answer would be no thats being handled amerihome is providing the leads and helping win the business and then we have the infrastructure on the traditional commercial bank side to absorb that business and if we add and if we have to add people it would be added on that side of the house where the expertise is timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then how about on the gain on sale business is there a variable component to that business and with gain on sale revenues coming down should we expect a likewise reduction in some of their home costs kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay again for some reason its a little cloudy in what youre asking but i think i got it yes there is a variable component of expenses there amerihome has decreased its people count from the time that we bought them also decreased their people count expectation from the time that we bought them and they run a pretty low cost shop so theyre very quick to size up appropriately for the volume and the margins that they generate were very confident that they move pretty quickly there dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah about of their costs are variable based upon kind of the volume counts timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then just lastly in regards to the atm that was exercised again this quarter can you just remind us if theres anything left on that program dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah the atm has about million shares in capacity in itself as we indicated we think we can kind of grow without it i mean in the first quarter we did take on some goodwill and so we had covering that was the reason otherwise ph we wouldnt need to do it then either we also grew our mortgage servicing rights which are a little bit of a capital hog but we think it made sense based upon valuation but going forward we dont see either of those kinds of things its back to the kind of the basics of the balance sheet and that balance sheet can handle more than billion worth of loan growth per quarter without touching any external capital sources western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay yeah and then you hit on the next point so the msr i think if i remember correctly the cap is kind of of cet1 before it becomes more punitive from a capital standpoint is that right way of thinking about it and thats dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah that would be a good line for us thats about billion in terms of msrs yeah timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great thanks for the questions kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp you bet operator your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty from kbw your line is open kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning chris or afternoon chris christopher oconnell q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc afternoon this is chris oconnell filling in for chris mcgratty just wanted to get some thoughts on the longer term loan trajectory and how you think about the sustainability of loan growth given that and i know the near term growth outlook is fairly clear but with residential mortgage now close to of the portfolio how you think about sustaining your growth rates kind of in the 12month to 24month timeline into and beyond kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so ill say we do a loan pipeline meeting every week here and the loan pipeline is busy active clients have not exhibited a reluctance to slow their growth plans although they are mindful of the economic backdrop i am out with clients quite often and they are still optimistic about their business but as i said mindful of the economic backdrop the beautiful thing that we have set up with amerihome is we can always bring in residential loans to offset our liquidity we are targeting our residential growth to be about of our total loan growth and back to your question about loan growth i think between the geographic and the business segment mix that we have established in this company we feel very comfortable with the growth guide that we gave and that growth guide continuing into so very active pipeline these days so were very comfortable where the futures taking us western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i mean our dependence on residential growth which picked up during the pandemic i think youre going to see that wane here as these other channels become more robust and frankly capital call was a big player and we see capital call is maybe being an area of more accelerated growth in the nearterm along with other technology christopher oconnell q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thats all i had appreciate the color thanks for taking my question operator and we have a followup question from brock vandervliet from ubs your line is open brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thanks just to followup on that comment dale in terms of the growth in capital call and other tech just maybe stepping back it seems like the innovation economy has gotten a bit of a karate chop lately what makes you so confident about those segments kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah brock im going to take this this is ken first a lot our capital call line and subscription line business is really not to the innovation economy its more to the traditional brand name pe firms and hedge indiscernible basically pederived firms that you would know and they are very active they are raising lots of funds i was with one about that three or four months ago and basically said to me we cant get enough credit i was down at the lenders the finance the fund finance conference down in miami a couple of weeks ago and again there too just a huge demand for subscription lines and capital call lines so were feeling optimistic about that channel for us brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and another segment warehouse have seen some really rough numbers across the sector here with little recovery expected you mentioned that quartertodate theres been a pickup is that sign of the marketing effort through amerihome gaining traction kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so first when we came into the year and we gave a billion loan guide per quarter we said we expected the warehouse lending group to remain flat for the fullyear and we still expect it to be flat for the fullyear were hopeful that it rises but we are doing a lot of crossselling weve got a lot of loans now in underwriting from amerihomes client base and thats on the warehouse lending side and also on the msr financing side as well brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thanks for the second round of questions western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 22apr2022 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp great operator thank you and ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of our qa
