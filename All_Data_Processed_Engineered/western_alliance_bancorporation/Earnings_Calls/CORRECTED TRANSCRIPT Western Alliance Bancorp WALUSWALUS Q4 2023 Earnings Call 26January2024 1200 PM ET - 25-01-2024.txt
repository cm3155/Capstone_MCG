who will review our financial results in more detail after i discuss our outlook tim bruckner will join us as usual for qa western alliances diversified national commercial business strategy continued to drive strong momentum in the fourth quarter as we generated earnings per share of or excluding of onetime notable items the quarter featured both healthy balance sheet growth and additional balance sheet repositioning actions to further optimize our funding base looking past these notable items which dale will explain shortly highlights for the quarter included solid loan and deposit growth ongoing capital and liquidity accumulation and continued stable asset quality deposit growth of billion allowed us to continue to selectively reduce debt and borrowings in  we fully repaid the billion of advances from the bank term funding program as well as a million amerihome senior notes which were not replaced with new borrowings regarding the amerihome notes we seized an opportunity to repay this higher cost debt at a discount additionally our portion of the industrywide fdic special assessment to replenish the deposit insurance fund totaled million loans rose million in the quarter bolstered by ci growth within our regional footprint western alliance begins supported by a strong capital base and liquidity position cet1 expanded approximately basis points during the year to which equates to when including aoci of our deposits are either insured or collateralized which ranks among the highest levels for the largest us western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2024 banks despite the industrys challenges our total deposits increased yearoveryear asset quality also remains in very good shape with limited net chargeoffs of only basis points of average loans in limited realized losses amidst a normalized credit backdrop is indicative in our view of the merits of lending with low advance rates adhering to conservative underwriting standards and approaching credit mitigation proactively continuing to shift our funding base from borrowings to core deposits better positions us to grow loans in a rate environment influx likely to decline later this year we have made investments and leadership additions in order to drive increased ci growth in our regional footprint expands the income opportunities across client relationships and complement the growth of our national business lines particularly our leading a leading deposit focused verticals overall in we look forward to consistent balance sheet and ppnr growth with higher liquidity and improving capital this will empower western alliance to continue partnering with our clients on their most important projects dale will now take you through the financial performance afterwards i will provide you with our outlook dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thank you ken for the year western alliance produced net revenue of billion net income of million and eps of net revenue increased from the prior year demonstrating the durability and flexibility of our business model net interest income rose million or approximately to over billion notwithstanding our curtailed loan growth and the completion of a series of asset sales earlier in the year noninterest income declined million from to million the repositioning actions the impact of fair value market as well as the slower mortgage purchase market noninterest expense of billion increased million yearoveryear primarily due to higher earnings credit rates and deposit costs driven by the rising rate environment turning to the fourth quarter trends and business drivers we generated reported preprovision net revenue of million net income of million and eps of as part of the balance sheet optimization efforts conducted earlier to support and improve our earnings trajectory we repaid million of amerihome senior notes at a discount we utilized this gain to better position the balance sheet by selling securities as well as msr fair value adjustments and sales which combined produced a pretax loss of million in addition to the million fdic special assessment when excluding these onetime notable items we generated adjusted net income of million and eps of net interest income increased million during the quarter to million from higher average earning asset balances and reduced higher cost borrowings gaap noninterest income was million or excluding notable items million which was down approximately million from  during the quarter wal saw approximately million of mortgage servicing rights which improved our capital ratios despite incurring a loss of million on disposition as prepayment speed began to recover from historically low levels evaluation of mortgage servicing rights moved lower at an accelerated pace which resulted in a million fair value adjustment net of hedging we dont believe this aggregate million charge is indicative of the earnings profile of our mortgage banking business lot volume has rebounded yearoveryear and may be indicative of continued momentum into since the december rate rally and resulting lower mortgage rates we have experienced incremental refinance volume and firming margins should mortgage rates trend lower in future quarters we would expect this business to benefit which has not been captured in our goforward guidance western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2024 additionally income from equity investments was elevated by approximately million due to outsized gains from solar tax credit investments with higher thanexpected performance during the quarter gaap noninterest expense was million or excluding noted items million a quarterly increase of million deposit cost growth slowed markedly increasing million in  as our settlement services and homeowners association businesses experienced strong growth in new customers that have surpassed seasonal declines in mortgage warehouse provision expense was million reflecting a steady asset quality lastly our effective tax rate of approximately was temporarily elevated in  primarily because of timing issues related to low income housing units that were not placed into service in the tax rate should reset from to loans held for investment grew million to billion while deposits increased billion to billion at quarterend mortgage servicing rights declined to billion from msr sales and reduced valuations resulting from the lower rate environment overall we continue to build high quality liquid asset levels and on balance sheet liquidity via strong deposit growth debt repayments previously discussed reduced investments in cash by million from september strong deposit growth over the last three quarters has allowed us to cut total borrowings and debt by half from the end of  finally tangible book value per share increased or over the prior quarter and year overyear to from retained earnings and reduced drag from negative all other comprehensive income loans held for investment growth was predominantly from ci categories some of which was indiscernible utilization construction and land loans were up million with a little under half of this contribution from lot banking given the national undersupply of homes and a greater likelihood of nearterm rate cuts we are still positive about the macroeconomics for this business deposit growth of billion was achieved despite typical seasonal declines in mortgage warehouse deposits related to tax and insurance payments we continue to experience broadbased growth from our specialized valueadded deposit channels hoa had its best  ever and we believe it will retain and possibly extend its leading market share in the country it had achieved in  of last year settlement services tech and innovation corporate trust and our digital consumer channel all grew materially and contributed to welldiversified growth noninterestbearing dda comprised of total deposits of which have no cash payment of earnings credits the decline in noninterestbearing balances was primarily driven by the expected billion decrease from typical mortgage warehouse seasonality of property tax and insurance escrow funds there has been no client attrition associated with these outflows and this decline is recovering as anticipated this quarter turning now to net interest drivers hfi loan yield decreased basis points due to the full quarter impact of the billion reclassification of loans from heldforsale to heldforinvestment at the end of  this coincidently resulted in heldforsale yields climbing basis points going forward we anticipate hfi yields to continue to be supported by an average of billion of loans repricing or maturing per quarter in the yield on total investments expanded basis points in  to the securities portfolio grew billion to billion from the ongoing hqla build which has increased treasuries from million at the end of  of last year to approximately billion at yearend the cost of interestbearing deposits increased basis points markedly slower than the prior quarter and the total cost of funds increased basis points to due to an increase in demand deposits and lower shortterm borrowings deposit growth enabled the million increased reduction in average shortterm borrowings as well as basis points of improvement in the cost of interestbearing liabilities in aggregate net interest income western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2024 increased approximately million while the net interest margin of came in at the midpoint of our  guidance our net interest income growth was exceeded by the growth rate of average earning assets noninterest expenses were impacted by million in net notable items this quarter adjusting for these onetime items as well as deposit costs our adjusted efficiency ratio rose basis points to we expect deposit costs will experience relief from a cessation of rate hikes and should fall as rates decline for historical context average ecr balances were billion in the fourth quarter compared to billion in  and billion in  of we expect ecrrelated deposits to remain a consistent relative proportion of our deposit base as total deposits grow based upon our rate forecast and generally high beta repricing for ecrrelated deposits we expect cessed pricing to largely decline in lockstep with rate cuts offsetting any potential net interest margin declines asset quality metrics continue to remain stable and in line with what we reported last quarter the aggregate net increase in special mention loans and classified assets was only million from the  level nonperforming assets increased to million equating to basis points of total assets which is basis points above the third quarter quarterly net loan chargeoffs were million or basis points of average loans which was aligned with  net chargeoffs provision expense of million was a function of loan growth and a slightly improved moodys consensus forecast though our consensus and severely adverse weightings for our acl still incorporate an recessionary outlook our allowance increased million from the prior quarter to million and the acl ratio was basis points covering of nonperforming loans looking at the reserve block youll see an updated look on the context behind our allowance which when considering insured loans or in those in low loss categories the allowance shifts up to of loans our cet ratio rose basis points to or when adjusting for the aoci debit our tangible common equity to total assets grew approximately basis points from  to from earnings and the improved aoci position tangible book value per share increased from  to from earnings and recapture of aoci marks the million improvement in aoci resulted from substantial decreases in intermediate term treasury rates during the quarter our consistent upward trajectory in tangible book value per share has outpaced peers by almost since including strong growth in over most of the time periods western alliance continues to generate a top quartile total shareholder return relative to both asset size peers and the regional banking index turning the call back to ken kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks dale our guidance for is to build on the second half momentum of and progress towards returning to above industry returns in the first half of the company will emphasize liquidity growth over loan growth drive capital above and further build our hqla portfolio which will temper earnings growth for the first half of the year as these goals are achieved earnings momentum will accelerate in the second half of and into so for the full year of we expect a continued thoughtful balance sheet growth driven by our diversified business model with an origination mix designed to drive net interest income above levels loan and core western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2024 deposits are expected to grow billion and billion respectively for the year core depositsdriven growth should continue to push our loantodeposit ratio towards the mid80 level by the middle of this year regarding capital we are targeting a cet ratio above reflecting steady organic capital accumulation in concert with balance sheet growth net interest income should grow to from a  annualized jumping off point this forecast assumes four 25basis point cuts backloaded in the year we expect any future nim compression resulting from the rate cuts to be matched by comparable deposit cost declines in noninterest expense which will be accretive to earnings noninterest income should increase to from an adjusted baseline level of million which excludes 2023s marktomarket adjustments and the impact of asset sales as we prioritize growing commercial bankingrelated fee income from holistic customer relationships mortgage bankingrelated income will be somewhat dependent on the rate environment and mortgage buying i should say and mortgage buying but were encouraged that with the recent low rate environment application volume is picking up with firmer margins thus far in early noninterest expense inclusive of the ecrrelated deposit cost should rise only to from an annualized adjusted  baseline of billion and allow for continued operating leverage in aggregate these factors will enable wal to consistently grow ppnr throughout the year asset quality remains manageable and we project continue support from our sponsors based on our conservative underwriting and low advance rates net charge offs are expected to be to basis points for the year as the economic cycle normalizes lastly we expect the effective tax rate to revert between and starting in  at this time tim dale and i are happy to take your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question for today comes from casey haire of jefferies the line is now open please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning everyone so wanted to start on the four cuts and how that impacts the ppnr guide obviously it hits you guys a number of ways dale i think you said that it does not your fees does not account for any upside in mortgage banking it sounds like the deposit costs within expenses are beta can you just confirm that and then the four cuts how would that what kind of deposit beta are you expecting for the nonecr component and how that would impact nii dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah in aggregate i mean to get into ppnr the net impact is fairly nominal i mean as weve indicated in the past if you just look at net interest income were modestly asset sensitive so that would be a little bit of a decrement but of course you alluded to the ecr repriced deposits which we expect to fall and fall in line yeah so put those together we think were again now modestly were modestly liability sensitive and we have a net benefit there in ppnr excluding the amerihome piece which is the option on its the call option if things get that much better in that space western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2024 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay so amerihome would be gravy if it did but obviously if its backhalfloaded it might be modest dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so the mix might look a little different i mean if you had a more accelerated rate decline maybe youre going to see a faster decline perhaps in net interest income reflecting the net interest income profile that we have but again when you layer in the deposit cost i think its going to eliminate that casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay and then so the loantodeposit growth guide for you got billion of liquidity to play with what is the plan for that build the bond book build cash pay down borrowings just wondering what your plans are there kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so when i think about the year i think about it the first half of the year were building the liquidity profile as you mentioned with that were really going to build our hqla portfolio and were looking to drive our loanto deposit ratios as i said in the mid from there its growth towards a much bigger and better so we need to continue to reposition ourselves we think well have that done by the end of the second quarter and then itll be a little bit more traditional earnings as you have seen them historically from us but i would say and when you think about it the deposit and loans are more coming in across the year in a ratable fashion with about million per quarter for loans and approximately billion per quarter for deposits casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you thank you and then just last one dale you mentioned the ph dea sounds like its recovering seasonally within mortgage warehouse just any update you can share on how much of that billion has come back in dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well so its really based upon semiannual property tax payments largely in california and so we would expect that were going to get half of that or twothirds of that this quarter and then the rest of it would start coming in as the payments due in may are less dramatic in terms of kind of the dip that we see meanwhile other warehouse bonds look to be growing consistently and were also off to a good start in our hoa biz for  kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp casey let me just add right now were on track to beat the billion for our  and thats inclusive of the hoa deposits coming back in casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thanks guys western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2024 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks operator thank you our next question comes from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan your line is now open please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everybody i wanted to start on the margin so you were at in the quarter right in the middle of what you had guided to dale for you how should we think about the nim trending the backdrop of four cuts and then its funny when i look at where the nim was we had a more normal curve i mean you guys were like but its a completely different balance sheet today so assuming we eventually get a normal curve normal level of rates like whats a reasonable nim for this balance sheet kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so hello steve its ken what i would say is again thinking about the year the first two quarters of the year the nim should track consistent with our  nim of and then  and  the nim will gently roll down as the rate cuts come into play but offsetting that nim decline will be the reduction in ecr expenses so whats transpired is we have and we expect to continue to have considerably more liquidity on the balance sheet and that is going to kind of depress nim in a basically a permanent basis where can we be kind of going forward i think we could be close to kind of where we are maybe the range is kind of sustainable kind of over kind of a broader economic cycle than what we see well probably have a little bit better return on the residential portfolio than we presently have but for the most part i think our number is rather than being in the i think were destined for the level here going forward steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp handle steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then on the expense guide so you guys were million on the ecr deposit costs in whats assumed within this expense guidance for for the cost of ecr deposits like where is that roughly dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so thats fairly stable until we get to as we indicated earlier we have a backend loaded four cuts starting in june in the rate and so that would kind of curtail based upon kind of how that plays out western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2024 indiscernible steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc go ahead kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp youre on a choppy line a little bit steve but i would say to dales point you there steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah im here yeah kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp steve got you then i would say just keep in mind youre thinking about your question is based on total dollars and so the rate will be coming down total dollars may still rise as we continue to push on deposit growth so just keep in mind the rate volume impact there okay steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah got it okay ken could i just finally ask you a big picture question so when look at the company right years back we had the financial crisis and you guys made quite a few changes after that right built out national businesses you had top decile growth for a long time then we had march madness you again pivoted right you made adjustments pushing up insured deposits change in liquidity et cetera when i look at the guide it looks like more of the same in the first half but then we get to the second half of the year and then what does this company then look like do you throttle up loan growth from where we are do you throttle that deposit growth are you back to a growth bank like how do you see the world right now in the longer term for the company thanks kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah good question we started to pivot by the way in the third quarter of with higher liquidity and higher capital and we certainly were very happy that we did as we entered march madness it really served us well and thats informed our decisionmaking as to why we want to keep that moving forward and as you said well have that basically completed by the first half of then i think what youre going to see is a little bit of the same bank but i dont think were going to put foot on the accelerator as hard as we used to push down on the throttle there and one reason is we never got really paid for that so up until the end of we were probably growing deposits and loans about per year and we didnt see that in our valuation and in fact people always got nervous with that and said gee there must be a credit problem that was lurking behind but really over that period of time we only had million of net losses western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2024 so what were going to do is were going to be targeting for aboveindustry trend growth going forward in the back half of and into and we think well get rewarded for that and take away any concerns that always linger about going way back even to and and that people bring up and i think well run from there but we should be higher in return on equity higher on return on assets but not to the old levels of coming back to to okay steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it yeah thats great color thanks for taking my questions kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america your line is now open please go ahead ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america securitiesmerrill lynch hey good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america securitiesmerrill lynch i guess maybe just one bigger picture question around earnings if i have the math right in terms of your earnings outlook you probably shake out around in eps for should we expect eps to dip in the first half before reaccelerating in the back half of the year how do you think about earnings growth relative to the you printed in the fourth quarter just given the moving pieces around what youre doing with hqla the benefit of rate cuts in the back half i would love to hear just the earnings trajectory that youre looking at dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so thats a really good question ebrahim so and maybe implicitly in your comments so the first quarter generally does have a dip and you can see this in prior years relative to and some of this is seasonal or based on higher prices costs of course theres a fewer number of days in  so and we get into that that should have a bit of a softer point in at the beginning of the year moving into  h1 its going to be impacted by what ken is talking about in terms of continuing to build out and finish by the end of the second quarter early in the third our hqla positioning so that would result in a little lower earnings growth during those first two periods as basically the deposit growth which we think is going to be fairly strong is diverted into an asset class that doesnt yield as much as that changes and as our loantodeposit ratio is in the so by summer thats going to be a more proportionate growth rate in loans as well as deposits and hence you do get a growth rate picking up through the end of and carrying into western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2024 ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america securitiesmerrill lynch thats helpful and i guess the other question you mentioned about never getting paid on the for loan growth back in the day when we think about how youre acquiring and what type of deposits you are acquiring today maybe ken is it different i mean youve obviously emphasized the regions and the deposit growth from the regions but im just wondering if your view around large chunky deposits has changed given sort of the emphasis on liquidity and as a result of that should we expect you to kind of go about differently when it comes to deposit growth and client acquisition kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so thanks for the question and i think your question is insightful because thats how were changing around the business so weve been working on a number of new deposit verticals that are really getting legs behind them and the first is settlement services and just this quarter alone we grew settlement services billion and so there the deposits are a little larger but the growth rate is steady and consistent so as you get to a certain level large deposits will flow off and then you got to bring other large deposits in additionally we have our business thats growing corporate trust business and that too is beginning to get some legs and in this quarter that grew by million now that business will continue to grow but it really will be helped once we get our investment grade ratings back and go back to the pivot the pivot is to get to our investment grade ratings so that corporate trust can be a bigger contributor to our deposits and we think with an over cet ratio mid loantodeposit ratio steady asset quality we will position ourselves to get upgraded there now hoa has been a long actually what was probably our first national business line and that continues to knock the ball out of the park in usually what is a slow quarter the fourth that is they grew million for the year they grew about billion and those are steady smaller deposits they come in from either new business that we win and the existing clients growing their book of business so we get that two ways then another business that were very pleased with was the one we started in early january january which is our consumer digital platform this quarter alone that brought in nearly million and thats been a real homerun for us and thats where we see deposits more in the to range for each client now going forward in into were going to try to shift the platform from an outside vendor to an internal platform and so were going to probably run two platforms for a while as we come up to speed with our own platform but that will help us also longer term and it will reduce not in but going forward in and it will reduce some of our maintenance expenses and then last but not least lets not forget what we are and our traditional ball game here and that is the regions and weve been rethinking redesigning the regions that was the reason why we moved tim out of his chief credit officer role into the chief banking officer for the regions thats why we brought in lynne herndon to take over the chief credit officer role and tims charge is to rethink and reimagine the regions and have them be more cifocused and with that focus in ci of course therell be more deposits and i should mention that million came in this quarter from the regions as well in deposits but it will also help us grow our fee income and so were going to get a twofer there over the long term itll be easier to bring in the deposits first and then that fee income as we continue to sell or crosssell our treasury management services will help us towards the western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2024 back end of but again pick up some steam into the new year of so i hope that kind of gives you a sense of what weve been doing and were looking at some other deposit verticals that are just early early stages and well probably work on them this year and hope to have them ready to go either in the back end of or early ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america securitiesmerrill lynch well that is helpful thanks for the rundown ken and what i didnt hear was does this change at all your view around doing any bank ma that you pick up a retail franchise bring in another deposit sort of generating engine or is that not kind of part of the equation today kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so today its not part of the equation were not talking about ma at all again were talking about the cet kind of move that upward but it will at some point the ma question will or conversation will come into play as we continue to get bigger and bigger we kind of do what we think were going to do with deposits then we now will be brought into play as we approach billion but frankly thats a premature conversation at this point i think we still have a couple of years before we get to billion ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america securitiesmerrill lynch perfect thank you operator thank you our next question comes from matthew clark of piper sandler your line is now open please go ahead matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning everyone just the first one on the loan growth guide of billion or million a quarter i thought we had previously talked about maybe some acceleration in loan growth in the second half is that just you all being a little conservative in the guide to start the year or should we not necessarily expect a stepup in loan growth in the second half kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so first let me say  we thought loan growth was going to be between zero and million and so we were a little surprised that it came in at million id rather be surprised on the upside as a general trend but were still going to be a little cautious about economic activity going forward and so were going to be mindful of this recession or slowdown that always was advertised to come but has not showed up yet and then we have sort of deemphasized certain asset classes for now those seeing obviously cre office and residential just to name the two some construction areas as well and so were just going to stay with the guide of million a quarter we think thats reasonable and if the liquidity comes in faster than we think then well look to deploy it in loan growth as a general rule weve never had problem deploying our liquidity and getting good safe sound and thoughtful loan growth western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2024 matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and then on the fee income guide if you look at the fourth quarter run rate i think when you make the fair value adjustments that exclude the securities losses and coming up with a run rate closer to million correct me if im wrong and you annualize that youre talking about call it million and your guide at the midpoint is roughly million off the last years base so maybe correct me if im wrong on that million but if that is correct it only implies it implies youre down this year and obviously you talked about not assuming any uptick in mortgage but just want to get the puts and takes there of what we might not be thinking about dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp look so we have a few things going on on the noninterest income side some of which were kind of implementing now weve got a kind of a service charge revision that were going to be undertaking we think as rates decline and ecrs come down then that puts more clients into a position where the earnings credit rate does not necessarily cover all of their consumption of internal services and that could also kind of push that up so we think that again were looking for growth in that category certainly kind of going forward and kind of expect to see that matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just last one for me on the interestbearing deposits can you update us on the spot rate at the end of the year and it seems like the pressure there is subsiding and kind of how you think about the beta on the way down on interestbearing specifically dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah interestbearing deposits spot rate was ph at yearend in terms of the beta coming down we think its going to be very strong we expect betas to be certainly no slower on the way down than they were on the way up you may recall that our betas have been faster than industry norms kind of this entire time and our clients are expecting that that is that were watching that closely and so are they so i expect that were going to be able to pull down the interest bearing cost for those that are ecrrelated pull those down as well on the imputed yields that some of them have which might be tied to the effective fed funds matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co got it okay great thank you kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks operator thank you our next question comes from chris mcgratty of kbw your line is now open please go ahead western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2024 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great good afternoon ken maybe a question on the balance sheet and capital you talked about not wanted to be in the 98percentile or so in terms of growth perspective that you wont get paid for it but youre at youre going to be at pretty soon like can you open the door a little bit on comments about appetite for buyback maybe in the back half of the year kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah right now we have no plans to do a buyback and is a little more of a floor for us i know we call it a target but its more of a floor so we want to build above that and then well have a growth capital and as we enter well were going to have a lot of decisions to make yeah if we see a lot of internal growth in front of us thats where i like to deploy the money first you got to tell me what the economic environment is and ill tell you if were going to do a buyback but really the buyback conversation has not been on the table in this company and again the is a floor for us christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so nothing for but perhaps where the alternatives between accelerating the growth and using the capital is that a fair for conversation kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp weve spent a lot of time talking about yeah we want to get through and make everything we just told you but for i can definitely tell you theres no buyback on the table christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you in terms of dale in terms of the balance sheet you mentioned the hqla bill how are you targeting a percent of your balance sheet in securities how do we think of the outcome this quarter how do we think about just the absolute kind of bridging the billion and the billion how much will go to buying incremental bonds dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so i mean you can impute this from kind of our guidance whereby were showing billion if you just did it ratably of growth in deposits in excess of loans and the preponderance of that is certainly going to go to hqla as we talked about earlier the first half of the year kind of getting over that hurdle that we think will be added by end of summer and was going to do that so if you just did that will be billion more in terms of hqla that would take us to there and then at that point in time maybe there is a more proportional growth rate between loans and deposits but thats kind of the range the numbers were talking about christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2024 operator thank you our next question comes from bernard von gizycki of deutsche bank your line is now open please go ahead bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi guys just a question on ecr pricing dynamics i know you noted the ecrrelated deposit costs are expected to decline with rates and volume just on rates i believe you have some deposits that pay the fed funds and others that are in the lower range so if you get a basis point cut with beta does that flow through all customers or just the higher cost ecr deposits and then you need additional rate cuts to get to the lower before cutting them or will ecr rates decline for all ecr deposits regardless of relationship kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yes the preponderance of our ecr price deposits are of the type that you initially talk about ie those that are really tied to effective fed funds and we think the beta with those is going to be very near the second piece where rates are significantly lower we probably have maybe a stutter step with the first rate increase were not necessarily going to be able to kind of fully kind of pass through but after that i think we can put them on a trajectory as well but that those betas will be significantly lower maybe we can get to on that piece of it but the larger piece i think is going to be at or near bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and if we think about the volumes between those two or the balances are they much higher for the like the lower one so once you start getting the cuts even though you have the beta for the indiscernible fed funds is it just a smaller balance im not sure we could size that or give a magnitude between the two kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so between what youre going to see in terms of warehouse lending some of the things that are settlement services some of our hoa deposits youre probably approximately twothirds of the number is going to have an elevated beta bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then if i could just ask one more just on your outlook guidance just so we think about net interest income you have the up and up could you just give us the underlying assumptions just the difference between the two like what gets you to the dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp the on net interest income is a combination of really the loan growth as we move forward thats whats going to move us in that direction and the additional liquidity were bringing in and placing that into investments western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2024 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah what does the yield curve look like i mean if the yield curve tends to be flat or it remains inverted thats going to probably look a little bit better on some of these commercial loans what does that mix look like and how is competitive pricing changing for all those items i dont we dont have a lot of insight into what that might be as the parameters around a number that might be more median bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay got it thanks for taking the questions operator thank you our next question comes from ben gerlinger of citi your line is now open please go ahead benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hi good morning everyone kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc just had a question it seems obviously a bit more technical in nature but it seems like loan yields are down linked quarter in almost every lending category i was curious if you just kind of touch based on maybe the nuance of why might be just a technicality like i said dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so i did talk about a little bit on the on what happened on the loans held for sale versus investment whereby we did a transfer from held for sale to investment and it really has gone down to the last day or they just before that of the third quarter so that will affect their dropped loan yields back to some degree theres also kind of been some mixed revisions in there going forward were still seeing pricing opportunity on the repricing elements we talked about the billion that on average we have a rolling or this year and while the piece of that it is fixed rate thats probably in about of that number those have a more ratable increase little bit on the variable side were still looking at elevated spreads relative to when those loans were originated two to three years ago benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you thats good so the next question i had was the spreads youre seeing in the market today like it seems like a lot of the 100plusbillion banks are stepping back in certain categories are you seeing better spreads because theres less lenders available or less lending being done from the bigger banks or is it kind of more just calling your shots and youre not seeing too many differ because i mean you do bank solid clients so they western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2024 typically would have the best rate available because its a competitive market im just trying to think about the yields going forward and especially pricing in a couple of cuts in the back half of the year kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah its almost marketbymarket dependent there are just things going on in different markets for us if youre talking tech and innovation spreads they really havent moved but a little more competitive because theres less deal flow because theyre raising a less cash there if youre talking some very specific like banking deals spreads are strong and we were getting our pricing and some of these banks are moving in and moving out its really hard to give one generic answer as to why they are all pulling back or not benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you okay if i could just sneak in one more in you said is a bit of a floor going forward in capital but you also referenced the credit rating the moment we get a public announcement from a credit rating agency is that a catalyst events for you guys or is it more or less you get to the is kind of what you guys agreed upon and once you hit at you kind of operate a bit more autonomously kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp well the is as i said a floor for us we have to engage or continue to engage with the rating agencies thats usually a twostep process they usually put you on outlook positive and then come back and make a change as far as i know so far we got a change in our outlook from fitch but i dont know theres any other bank that had a change in their outlook so my sense is the rating agencies may be a little slow to pull the trigger but when we go in there we want to go in there with great capital levels of firm steady stable asset quality and a very strong liquidity and thats how were positioning the company and in the meantime our corporate trust group is still operating and bringing in good business they could just bring in more business with the upgrade to an investment rating so theyre doing just fine and it would just this would just accelerate their opportunities to bring in more business benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you okay i appreciate it youre probably at by the time you get that announcement but i appreciate the time guys kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks operator thank you our next question comes from brody preston of ubs your line is now open please go ahead brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc yeah thanks i just wanted to follow up on the loan yields i understand that the move from the hfs to hfi but i was hoping dale if you could provide what the spot rate was for the loan portfolio at the end of the quarter western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2024 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay thank you very much i also wanted to get a better sense for the btfp what was the rationale behind paying off the btfp but not more expensive borrowings i think the last time in your 10q i think the rate on the btfp was versus the average shortterm borrowing rate of this quarter i just wanted to better understand the thought process there dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp frankly we just thought we didnt need to be indiscernible for the reserve and so we did that i agree with you its at a modest cost it was going to mature anyway this is something that we had acquired in march of last year and it was a 12month deal so it was a couple of months early relative to what it would have been but we thought we just it was part of the situation and well leave it behind in brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you i wanted to clarify just on the ecrrelated deposits i think the slide says you have billion of ecr deposits at quarterend but youve got about billion of nib so is there another component of the ecrrelated deposits thats technically still interestbearing but also gets compensated through ecr kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah correct so what will happen is we depending on what type of client it is we could have a situation whereby the manager gets the ecr and the owner gets the interest income so you dont really see that in mortgage warehouse because those are really not interestbearing deposits but on an hoa for example its a dual situation most commonly whereby the aggregator gets earnings credit rate on the dollars that are owned by the hoa itself that is not interest expense because they simply have no claim on that liability to us and the deposits of that enterprise so thats why its a doubled up brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and then the last question i had was just on the msr loss i just wanted to maybe understand the mechanics a little bit dale did you throughout the course of this past year did you maybe put a higher mark on the msr and the corresponding production capitalize it at a higher rate and did that impact the gain on sale margin at all and then youd have to take a loss on it when rates moved against you and you sold the msr this quarter i just want to understand the moving parts there dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp no no no i wouldnt say that i mean it was kind of the volatility around what happened so we saw cprs declined to the slowest than i think id ever seen and maybe some recent business had been around but they were like to on the constant prepayment risk and that is exceptionally low and then when rates picked western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2024 up again i mean rate fell cpr has jumped and maybe it was a little bit of a catchup from refis or whatever that have been delayed and so as a result of that we had a gain in our hedge that fell short of the loss in terms of the valuation so the result was the value of those servicing rights fell by million in the fourth quarter and we were million shy of what we picked up in terms of gain on the hedge and that was because we had such a rapid velocity change between a very low cpr and maybe the lowest ever to which is something that was more normalized so kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah brody i just to remind you that by the end of  the 10year treasury dropped basis points from to just punctuate sales point and this is the msr balance we have several outside valuation firms that come in and look at that msr and evaluate for us to make sure that were within the appropriate range brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it understood thank you very much for taking my questions guys kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp youre welcome operator thank you our next question come from andrew terrell of stephens your line is now open please go ahead andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc hey good morning dale if i could start just i heard comments around the mortgage banking and kind of the potential upside there not being captured on the goforward guide just to the extent the mortgage market does turn and we do end up seeing kind of upside on the fee income front over time can you just remind us the incremental efficiency in that business and maybe just to give us a better sense of how the expenses would fluctuate with the indiscernible fees dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i mean so where they were on standalone enterprise they were running about and when we acquired them we were in kind of low and they came in and that took us to kind of the mid i think thats basically intact today so yeah so its frankly their marginal rate of efficiency is pretty close to the banks overall now as the bank has invested in elements of the higher cost with technology and some of this risk management infrastructure and lower investment yields related to the building of the hqla so right now our efficiency ratios are comparable at about andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay i appreciate it and then just looking at the deposit cost expense line this quarter if i compare the disclosed expense on deposit calls versus the average balance of ecr deposits it looks like on a percentage basis that the western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2024 cost ticked down a few basis points this quarter have you lowered rates anywhere on the product already or is that more of a function of mix this quarter kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp we havent lowered rates but what we have done is we have oneoff of clients and said look your spread relative to say effective fed funds has been x and were going to make it x minus and some of this is going to happen a little maybe perhaps a little bit later were going to do something today but weve given them options if you want to take a rate cut now well skip maybe the first one you get so were pushing those down on a basically individually as we kind of go through this so we are picking that up now i think thats going to continue into january february andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc and did you see any attrition as a result of those conversations or is there any color there kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp no so there hasnt been any attrition and i think that is an input point for us in terms of what is our pricing like relative to alternatives elsewhere i think what it means is that the fever has broken on the rate cycle certainly and the opportunity to move into either other financial institutions or to move it to some kind of off balance sheet thing that maybe is invested in treasuries all of those have fallen in terms of what the opportunity is or what they might be able to migrate to and i think that has helped us in this negotiation we do these oneoff and to some degree sequentially in case we run into a situation like that where were starting to see some attrition and like okay well thats an important point and then well ease off in terms of how many were doing or what were asking for them to give up andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay great really appreciate the time this morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks operator thank you our next question comes from david smith of autonomous david your line is now open please go ahead david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp thank you i want to circle back to those normalized nim comments earlier in the call are you saying that should be a floor or more the middle range for nim in a typical rate cycle kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2024 well that was kind of that was in a kind of an extended conversation of where might we head over time and getting back to a number of a fourhandle i dont see that so i mean thats an extended expectation of maybe kind of where we might be i do feel like that were approaching kind of an equilibrium level now and so the number is not that far from that but im not that isnt our guidance in terms of kind of where were headed in we do think that as i indicated david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp okay and on capital kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp sorry go on yeah david go ahead david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp yeah so if theres nothing else on the nim talking about capital if youre going to keep doing a highteens rotce and with your loan growth guide i think that only implies something like or rwa growth this year so that just seems to imply a ton of excess capital being generated and you should reach cet1 pretty soon and is the floor but is there a level where you think that just starts to get excess of and even regardless of the change in ratings just it starts to make sense to turn on the buyback if youre still being measured with a little bit longer kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp look as were as we climb above i think it introduces optionality you can build capital and then that could be part of an ma transaction there could be multiple things that going to done with it but again its just were not there right now and were again cleaning up kind of the last few things that we want to change on our balance sheet and by this summertime i think well be there in terms of the profile were looking for liquidity david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp got it and lastly on deposits can you share how much of the interestbearing deposits are indexed to a rate as opposed to having some level of discretion at the bank in terms of pricing kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp well i mean so i mean if you look at our interestbearing deposit cost you can see that that is not as large of a component relative to kind of some of these ecr outlooks weve been talking about so there is some that is a little bit higher beta but it is less significant than on the ecr piece operator thank you our next question comes from timur brazilerof wells fargo your line is now open please go ahead sorry timur your line is now open please go ahead timur has disconnected at this time we currently have no further questions so ill hand back to ken vecchione for any further remarks western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 26jan2024 kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp well thank you very much for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you about in a couple of months from now thanks again operator thank you for joining todays call you may now disconnect your lines
