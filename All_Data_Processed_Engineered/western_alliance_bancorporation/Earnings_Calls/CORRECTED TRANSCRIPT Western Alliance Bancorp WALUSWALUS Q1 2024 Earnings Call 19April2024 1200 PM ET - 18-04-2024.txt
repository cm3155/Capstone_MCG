president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning everyone ill make some brief comments about our first quarter earnings before turning the call over to dale he will review the financial results in more detail ill come back and discuss the outlook and then tim bruckner our chief banking officer will join us for qa for the last three quarters the mission of the company has been to reposition the balance sheet and optimize our funding structure to establish an unassailable foundation of higher capital liquidity and insured and collateralized deposits and further distance us from last launch together these factors should provide a bulwark to better insulate the bank from future industry and market volatility as well as support more predictable superior long term returns this quarter we generate exceptional deposit growth of billion that accelerated our repositioning plan at a faster pace than anticipated we reached our cet1 capital target of lowered our hfi loantodeposit ratio by points to and increased our already leading insured deposit ratio to our liquidity profile was also enhanced by a billion increase in unencumbered securities and cash from year end which also will allow us to pay down which also allow us to pay down borrowings by billion in summary our repositioning goals have largely been accomplished im pleased that during the quarter of outsized liquidity growth western alliance earned per share excluding the increased special assessment from the fdic and tangible book value continue to climb despite rate headwinds asset quality remains steady with special mention loans and classified assets declining million in aggregate from  net chargeoffs remain low at only basis points of average loans our excellent liquidity positions us to drive stronger loan growth starting in  western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2024 loan growth should track proportionately with deposits to maintain our improved loantodeposit ratio and allow us to exit in line with market expectations dale will now take you through the financial results dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks ken during the first quarter western alliance generated reported preprovision net revenue of million net income of million and earnings per share of excluding the million fdic special assessment charge ppnr was million net income million and earnings per share was net interest income increased million from  to million from higher average earning asset balances as well as lower average borrowings noninterest income of million increased million quarteroverquarter from consistent performance in mortgage banking including an improved msr valuation from a higher balance of servicing rights owned we look at mortgage revenue holistically because our conservative valuation process when servicing rates are created often results in understated msr values which dampen gainonsale revenue gaap noninterest expense was million or million excluding the fdic special assessment deposit costs of million were million above  levels essentially offsetting the net interest income growth during the quarter and driven by strong deposit growth from both existing and new clients in our hoa and juris banking businesses along with the continued rebound in mortgage warehouse from seasonal lows typical seasonal factors as well as the reset of incentive compensation accruals which were discounted in were the primary reasons for the increase in salaries and employee benefits in  provision expense of million resulted from loan growth as well as million in net chargeoffs while our economic outlook remained stable lastly our effective tax rate fell to from a temporarily elevated rate last quarter loans held for investment grew million to billion while deposits increased billion to billion at quarter end as a result our held for investment loantodeposit ratio fell to from last quarter outsized deposit growth accelerated our liquidity building efforts securities and cash increased by billion quarteroverquarter and allowed for a further billion reduction in borrowings finally tangible book value per share expanded for the quarter to from retained earnings which more than offset a modest rate driven increase in our negative aoci position held for investment loan growth of million incurred predominantly in ci categories commercial and industrial growth of million demonstrated noteworthy progress in our regional commercial banking strategy as well as success in both mortgage warehouse and tech and innovation ci growth also mitigated a purposeful reduction in commercial real estate on a yearoveryear basis total loans increased billion almost entirely from ci production which has been a point of emphasis for the bank outstanding deposit growth of billion resulted from broadbased growth and market share gains from our regions commercial deposit businesses and digital consumer channels more specifically our regions contributed approximately billion hoa and digital consumer each over million juris banking over million and corporate trust added million mortgage warehouse deposits reacquired the billion and fully replaced  outflows as our dda deposit balance at march 31st surpassed where we were at september 30th overall in the more stable rate environment we are experiencing minimal mix shift of existing client funds into higher cost deposits turning now to our net interest drivers held for investment loan yields increased basis points due to the higher rate environment loan growth was weighted toward the end of the quarter as demonstrated by period end loan western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2024 balances exceeding average balances by billion the yield on total securities decreased basis points to from our efforts to significantly enhance our liquidity profile which resulted in total highquality liquid securities increasing billion from  in addition the proportion of average interest earning assets invested in securities and cash increased to from in the fourth quarter as a result of these repositioning efforts which have largely been completed these efforts position us well to deploy incremental funds into higher yielding commercial loans earlier than initially expected as well as to manage the cost of deposits lower ahead of fed rate cuts the cost of total interest bearing deposits expanded basis points while the total cost of funds was flat at as average shortterm borrowings declined billion to of average interest bearing liabilities in aggregate net interest income increased approximately million while net interest margin of compressed basis point due to the earning asset mix shift in securities we discussed additionally adjusting for the increased fdic special assessment and deposit costs our adjusted efficiency ratio for the quarter was which also reflected higher seasonal costs deposit costs moved up only million or quarteroverquarter even though average balances of ecrrelated deposits grew billion or asset quality metrics continue to remain steady and are reflective of our ongoing forwardlooking portfolio monitoring and proactive credit mitigation strategy which produce low realized losses in aggregate special mention loans and classified assets declined million from  nonperforming assets increased million to million or basis points of total assets as we execute our strategy to accelerate resolution for this subset of loans and proactively address them before reaching maturity notably about twothirds of our npls are paying as agreed with regard to debt service obligations as stated previously weve largely avoided the largest urban centers for commercial real estate lending that have experienced more value contraction in the nation at large we see that in our submarkets which we watch closely our borrowers projections continue to perform better with more stable appraisals than other markets quarterly net loan chargeoffs were million or basis points of average loans provision expense of million covered net chargeoffs and provided reserves in concert with loan growth our allowance for funded loans increased million from the prior quarter to million and the allowance for credit loss ratio to funded loans of basis points was stable covering of nonperforming loans the valuation of npls which primarily consists of real estate secured credits are confirmed by fair value appraisals of collateral our cet1 ratio again grew points to or when adjusted for our negative aoci position which is basis points higher yearoveryear and basis points above our  level when our repositioning efforts began our tangible common equity to total assets ratio moved down approximately basis points from  to as asset growth and low risk categories exceeded organic capital accretion from higher earnings tangible book value per share increased from december 31st to from retained earnings growth outpacing the higher aoci offset our consistent upward trajectory and tangible book value per share has outpaced peers by over times since including strong growth in ill now hand the call back to ken western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2024 kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay thanks dale we have transformed the bank several times in the companys history starting as a las vegas bank in and expanding into arizona and california in in after the gfc during which we were landlocked in some of the most stressed markets nationally we began our diversification strategy into national business lines with hoa and mortgage warehouse that created diversity growth and sustainable earnings without undue risk in and we added bridge bank to enter into the tech and innovation economy and then purchased the hotel franchise finance business which provided expertise and deep industry knowledge enabling us to become a leader in that vertical in and the bank entered developed and launched three specialty deposit verticals settlement services business escrow services and corporate trust that expanded business diversification strategy and produced access to new deposit sources in we launched a digital consumer deposit strategy to gain access to a granular deposit base now in the company has worked hard to reposition and fortify its balance sheet and liquidity informed by the events of last launch the management team continues to optimize funding significantly improve capital and carry higher levels of insured and collateralized deposits to form a solid sturdy balance sheet which can be used as the foundation to reignite earnings grow the balance sheet and generate organic capital while ensuring asset quality remains safe and protected so what does wal look like in the future well using and reinforcing the discipline i just mentioned western alliance has and will continue to have risk management architecture that will enhance the companys guardrails as we continue to develop new organic avenues for growth to deliver consistent upper teens return on tangible common equity and sustainable earnings growth that maintains historical capital accumulation at multiples higher than other banks we are excited that the repositioning strategy has been largely completed we have fortified our balance sheet which will allow the company to generate earnings velocity through the back half of and into to that end from our first quarter results we update our guidance as follows continued thoughtful balance sheet growth at a slightly higher level building on the momentum of  and more focus on deploying incremental liquidity into sound safe and thoughtful loans our current loantodeposit ratio provides flexibility to selectively make more loans as opportunities arise for the full year loans are expected to grow billion up from billion given the new client wins and current pipelines we also expect deposits to end the year up billion which is billion above our previous consensus turning to capital we expect our cet1 ratio to remain steady at or near capturing the forecasted increase in loan volume regarding net interest income we reaffirm our to growth expectation from  2023s annualized jumping off point and are tracking to the upper end of this range our rate outlook includes two basis point cuts in the back half of the year in a higher for longer rate environment without rate cuts by the frb we would expect nim to incrementally benefit by midsingle digit basis points from loans repricing in an elevated rate environment our expectation is western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2024 that net interest margin will trough in  with the full impact of our liquidity build while net interest income will continue to move higher from  levels nim should ascend due to repricing of existing loans and new loan originations which allin should generate a full year nim in the low3 noninterest income should increase to from an adjusted baseline level of million mortgage banking related income remains somewhat dependent on the rate environment and mortgage volume but we are encouraged by the resilience of the  results noninterest expense inclusive of ecr related deposit costs is now expected to rise to from an annualize adjusted  baseline of billion primarily from the accelerated ecr related deposit growth we achieved in  which helped the company reach liquidity targets earlier than expected in aggregate these factors should enable western alliance to consistently grow ppnr throughout the year and establish a higher baseline headed into asset quality continues to remain steady and is performing as expected with continued sponsor support of projects our full year net chargeoff guidance remains to basis points of average loans at this time dale tim and i look forward to answering your questions question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question comes from the line of jared shaw with barclays jared please go ahead jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning guys just looking at the kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc thanks looking at the guidance with the expense growth primarily coming from the ecr i guess why wouldnt that also help drive higher expectation for nii youre saying looking at the higher end of that but if with this big deposit growth and the opportunity for loan growth i guess whats are we giving up all of that spread early stages to the ecr dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp no it will help drive nii the issue is is that growth came in kind of ratably over the first quarter we havent genned up to the degree we can the origination of good quality credit to disperse those additional funds thats going to take a process within say the second quarter so it will catch up but the second quarter is a little bit of a pivot point whereby were going to look for higher asset growth than we had in  and thats going to hold that the second quarter back a bit western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2024 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp the prior guide let me just add the prior guide included for rate cuts which have now been revised to two cuts to offset that weve also increased our loan growth from million a quarter to billion a quarter and thats what helps our net interest income throughout the rest of the year continue to grow quartertoquarter jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay all right thanks for that i guess maybe shifting a little to the capital and now that youre at the target floor of how should we be thinking about the desire to grow that from here and can you give an update on how the credit linked notes impact that going forward and sort of the timing on that kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so we see capital remaining modestly at or above for the remainder of the year increasing loan growth above trend will absorb the excess capital formation for the rest of the year i will note that since we started our repositioning strategy on capital from  of weve increased the cet1 ratio basis points without raising capital we do have a couple of clns embedded into these numbers and the runoff of the clns is very modest yearoveryear dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah as you recall we collapsed two of our clns last year the mortgage warehouse and capital call weve got a few residentials that are that dont have substitution credits in them so they are just running off were gaining about to basis points in cet1 from that operator thank you the next question comes from the line of casey haire with jefferies casey please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thanks good morning guys question on the loan and deposit growth just wondering how you guys got to those numbers i mean you guys have demonstrated that youre capable of putting up stronger growth than that and im just wondering if its conservative or if youre just looking to manage the growth and have an eye on obviously the billion line so just some color there dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so casey while we continue to remain cautious about the future economic activity and we have de emphasized certain asset classes we do believe that we can actively grow loan billion per quarter and we feel rather comfortable with that based on the pipelines that get reviewed on a weekly basis so we are de emphasizing certain areas as you would expect cre office residential general construction a little cautious on multifamily but we see better opportunities in warehouse lending group msr lending the regional ci business is beginning to take hold resource lending and maybe lot banking also give us the best risk reward dynamics on the loan side so if we can do better than billion we will as long as its safe sound and thoughtful growth and the economic environment hasnt changed but right now we feel comfortable with the billion western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2024 as it relates to the deposit guide we certainly had a monster quarter at billion a lot of that came in because of our we think because of our debt service levels and we had a number of market share wins as well as a number of our new deposit verticals have really begun to take hold settlement service had a good quarter corporate trust is growing hoa had its best quarter ever it was monstrous okay and in fact we think we are now the leader in hoa deposits in the industry and then the regions also had a very good quarter as well for billion so taken together all that informs us that we think were comfortable growing deposits billion a quarter for the rest of the year casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i will say and something were proud of here when you look at when you look back over a year weve grown total deposits by billion if you take out billion for broker deposits we grew billion in a year and that kind of gives us the confidence level to say that billion seems very reasonable and practical casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah okay and then just switching to the expense front just to clarify does the expense guide do include the million fdic assessment for this year and then if i layer in your guide it looks like its delivering an efficiency ratio in the low thats obviously with the deposit cost but its obviously running a little bit higher than what youve been guiding to in the past i think its been around so just wondering whats the new expectation on that front dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah yeah yeah i would look for something in kind of the mid we were for the first quarter as you saw there there were some seasonality in costs which we talked about a little bit primarily related to compensation indiscernible but we do believe that we can get that number back to beginning with a again but we would hope to have better performance i think its always much stronger from amerihome in that process we do think that theres a significant kind of pent up demand with amerihome and that there is a lot of people that do want to move out of their house but theyre kind of there along with their mortgage rate presently as the when we have that dip down at the fomc commentary after the cpi impact in january that really kind of came back and we saw a lot more activity you saw that in our numbers so with that on the denominator side more steady situation on the numerator side regarding ecr we think that number can trail down over time but for now i keep it in the mid kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp casey on the fdic special assessment thats not in our numbers in our guide and our adjusted efficiency is going to be in the low as we work that down towards the high but thats what i would say okay western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2024 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thank you operator thank you the next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan steven please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everybody i want to start kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp steve can you get a little closer to the phone youre coming in muted steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah could you hear me now kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp much better thank you steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so let me start on the deposit side ken i thought you said you thought you could grow deposits billion per quarter is that right because that would take you above the billion for the year kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp well on average billion a quarter but  is a little softer as youve seen last quarter where the warehouse lending deposits roll out so we think thats more of a practical guide basically were just trying to tell you think about the end number of billion is where we think well end up steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay its funny ken ive asked you i dont know maybe two or three calls in a row once you get to your targets how should we think about western alliance and growth desire appetite where you could be longterm so if we think about if we average this out youre probably billion billion per quarter loans and deposits run rate so call it billion per year for each is that about and adjusting for loantodeposit ratio is that how we should think about this now that youre at target maybe that billionish growth per year balance sheet kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2024 so weve got a number of levers to pull and we have a great deal of optionality so first thing id say is in the way were thinking about it is from here whatever liquidity we bring in whatever deposit growth we bring in we would like to put out at about loantodeposit ratio so we could stay between that and level and thats what were going to try to target going forward itll take a little while to build up that loan growth engine because obviously if were telling you billion in deposits and billion to loans thats not but were genning that back up again youve got to get the deals done youve got to get them documented youve got to have clients put their cash in before we put our funding in and that will just build up as we go throughout and into and then if we do better than that meaning higher deposits or the loans stay in that billion plus range then well use some of that incremental liquidity and well use it to pay down borrowings and that will also use the growth of the balance sheet dale you want to add anything to that dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i mean so stated another way i expect that we can exceed those numbers steve a bit because were paying down borrowings coincident with growing deposits faster than your billion a year number operator thank you the next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw chris please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right good morning ken dale it feels like the billion has obviously has got a ton of attention it feels like youve more or less addressed every piece of it obviously theres ongoing regulation but liquidity expenses capital is that the message youre trying to send with the last two actions over last few quarters kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so we are taking actions today and preparing to cross over billion in a few years okay the improvements weve made in our risk management architecture both on capital analysis liquidity analysis and planning indicated to us that it was better to build that liquidity reservoir early on and we wanted to get that done and weve accomplished that the other thing was lets get capital out of the way we think around that number is the right number going forward so weve done all that but behind the scenes also chris is a lot more risk management build that has to occur thats been basically built into the company over the last couple of years so where we are today well say were about of the way towards being ready to be billion billion is just the number for us were not looking to get there sooner it all depends on again the economy and the opportunities that we have in front of us but what we dont want to happen is we dont want to be stopped when we hit that level so we want to grow in an unencumbered way in the meantime the risk architecture that were putting into the company is paying dividends and does have a return and how we think and manage the company so were happy that were doing that as well christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2024 operator thank you the next question comes from the line of bernard vongizycki with deutsche bank your line is now open bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning so you guys had a nice quarter with fees but you didnt change the full year noninterest income guide outlook you noted mortgage will be dependent on rates but you were encouraged by the resilient results i mean how should we think about maybe the seasonality after the different fee lines for rest of the year additionally equity investments have picked up the past two quarters wondering if you could provide any color there and how you think it should trend for the rest of year kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so there are a couple of questions inside of that ill take a shot at it and dale will fill in if i miss anything but a good portion of the fee income comes from mortgage i would say that mortgage hangs around the hoop for the next couple of quarters similar to that of  and of course  for mortgage is always lighter because of seasonal reasons the gains you mentioned on the warrants thats very consistent with the prior quarter it consists of valuing over positions every quarter and as the tech business grows we expect there to be more positions to be valued and right now we dont see a retracement in value at this time and we think the way were valuing based on where the tech industry is were valuing it at the lower point of the cycle dale would you add anything dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah just a couple things so on the seasonality implication so hoa their best quarter is  and that helped contributed to an early billion increase there as well as the recovery in kind of mortgage warehouse deposits so i would expect that future quarters are going to be lower than what we put out in the first quarter and in terms of our guidance we are tracking towards the upper end of our guide thats in the book regarding net interest income but frankly were a little above the midpoint for noninterest income as well bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay got it and dale i think you noted earlier that you dont expect much deposit mix shift from here obviously the quarter was great with the amount of deposits you brought in but the mix shift was obviously favorable mostly the noninterest bearing and then obviously in the interest bearing there is less focus on the higher cost cds when you think about the rest of the year you kind of said the minimal mix where are you kind of thinking for the additional billion would be kind of similar as we kind of look out to the outside quarters dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well if i put on my optimistic hat i mean were really doing some creative things in the regions which would be a primary source of where we might get noninterest bearing deposits and i would hope that we could actually show growth there we certainly saw growth in the first quarter and were looking for that to continue as you maybe the trend you allude to in terms of cds i think that that is going to continue to taper off as we run through and of course the preponderance of growth is going to come in money market western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2024 operator thank you the next question comes from the line of ben gerlinger with citi your line is now open benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc good morning guys sorry about the background noise i had to step out i just had a question in terms of the ecr i know you guys lowered it the cut expectations to kind of two in the latter half of this year but just kind of thinking philosophically if we have two more in the early part of next year so a total of four just kind of pushed it out six months do you think next years expenses could actually be flat if not down dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i think that can certainly be the case also would probably help with revenue significantly on amerihome as we discussed as well benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc yeah okay kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp said another way we were talking about this earlier i was going to say any future rate cuts into will help fund any inflation we have in the base and i think thats what youre suggesting dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp one more point getting to kens comment earlier about optionality one thing that this pool of liquidity gives us to enable us to do is to really oneoff some of our higher cost ecrs now which we are undertaking to push them down and so we can get in front of fomc action with lower funding cost you saw that a little bit in  to  when the average ecr actually declined slightly wed like to see more of that of course benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you thats great and nice to see you all get back to the kind of a powerhouse that you used to be in terms of growth potential kind of with that though have you guys thought about any sort of potential ma not necessarily go over billion but just bolton technology or any kind of fintechs just any sort of capital deployment outside of the share repurchase dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so still for us a little premature to think about ma and i would say given the prospects that we see in front of us wed like to take any excess capital that we have and put it into organic growth we think that would serve us best western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2024 operator thank you the next question comes from the line of matthew clark with piper sandler matthew please go ahead matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey thanks good morning everyone on your interest bearing deposit costs youre up bps this quarter i think the prior quarter up can you give us a spot rate on interest bearing deposits and whats your outlook there is it fair to assume that that rate of change will start to slow here or maybe stabilize next quarter or two dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah were looking at really kind of stability across the board both on asset repricing and on kind of liability here there hasnt been since its obviously been since last september kind of the last kind of rate changes were talking about in july its really kind of tapered off and the volatility is very stable as i mentioned earlier i think you see that net interest income going up approximately the same amount as the earnings credit cost rose so there is no great disparities between spot rates and kind of average rates presently kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp well what i would add is that while deposit costs went up we got rid of billion in borrowings and our overall cost of funds stayed flat quartertoquarter so when you think about what happened for the quarter relative to net interest margin our loan yield went up basis points our deposit cost went up a we paid down debt and really the bottom line here is the margin dropped a little bit because of the excess liquidity we brought in that were keeping on the balance sheet in cash and in investment securities matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co yep got it okay and then just last one for me the uptick in classified assets and nonperformers can you just speak to what drove those increases and kind of plan for resolution there timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp sure sure tim bruckner ill take that so first ill just say the majority is related to secured investor real estate loans this really results as a function of how we manage our portfolio so as weve taken every opportunity to tell all of our constituents we press hard for remargining and have since early in the rate increase cycle that drives to resolution so the classified loans will move up as we reach the endpoint of the negotiation that doesnt resolve in effective remargin we then take those loans and we ledger the balance appropriately based on the value of the asset we apply all principal and interest payments received to reduce that loan balance and i think its important to note on our books that twothirds of these are current in terms of payments being made so were not waiting for a delinquency to take our action here kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp and all the ones we moved in this quarter were all paid as well western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2024 timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp correct ken operator thank you the next question comes from the line of timur braziler with wells fargo your line is now open timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi thanks maybe just following up on that last line of questioning could you just talk us through the interplay between nonperforming loan migration and the allowance i guess i was a little surprised to see npls move higher while overall allowance levels pretty much flat quarteronquarter timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp sure tim again i think its important to note this context that the majority we have a very small chargeoff every quarter the majority of the charge that we took this quarter was really associated with adjusting the balances of those loans as they migrate so that we have plenty of coverage based on current appraised value of the asset less the cost of liquidity so we move fairly aggressively and into nonperforming we adjust our balance as opposed to placing just reserves on that timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and just the migration itself doesnt necessarily kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp indiscernible timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc what was that kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp absolutely right and so when we talk about our philosophy here were a low loan deposit lender when you look at office underwritten office at is where were at so we look at this in the economy of credit underwriting collateral and our collateral position creates character and creates support from sponsorship and thats what we see demonstrated so it carries through that we typically have very low loan to carrying values throughout the entire throughout the process where we get close we make an adjustment take a charge and stay in balance dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2024 our chargeoff rate for the quarter annualized was basis points which is only about maybe a fifth or a fourth of what the industry is our reserve level is basis points indiscernible in the appendix of the earnings release we walk that up to the level considering the things that we have that we do that others dont do like the higher levels of residential real estate as well as clms we talked about a little bit and so we think thats actually a pretty strong level at basis points so if you take basis points in the youve got nine years of loss coverage within there well our duration of our loan book is under four kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp id add more than anything when we look at this category its performing as expected and moving to resolution as expected timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then maybe as my followup just looking at the securities purchases this quarter can you give us the bridge just to get a sense of what that blended effect will look like in kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp we didnt hear that clearly enough timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc for the securities purchases made during the quarter just trying to get a sense of what the rate was on those purchases to get a idea of what the blended rate in the second quarter will look like timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp yeah so the rate that we have on average for the quarter which you saw back down basis points in the that should be fairly consistent with whats been done the purchases that were done were fairly shortterm expect to maybe roll out of some of that and keeps maybe more at the federal reserve as well so thats probably a little bit of a stronger profile operator thank you the next question comes from the line of david smith with autonomous research your line is now open david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp could you just confirm what you think your true asset sensitivity is today the 10k said that basis point higher shock would boost nii by and i thought i heard you saying earlier that the nii guide is towards the high end but the better loan growth is being offset by there being two fewer cuts in the model which would imply liability sensitivity so if you could just expand on that i know that nii is just one piece for you with the deposit costs and the mortgage income benefiting from the lower rates but just strictly for the nii like how you view the impact of the higher or lower fed today western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2024 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah correct i mean nii is going to be increasing in a higher rate environment and you saw that a little bit here even though it looks stable environment we did have a bit of a slope upward in yield as net interest income was up million whats changed though is that were really looking more at what we call earnings at risk so it considers the nii it considers the ecr and then it also considers what might happen in the amerihome context and if i put all those together we would prefer a lower rate environment rather than higher because of kind of the additional leverage pickup we would get in amerihome in particular but yes nii solely would still increase in a rising rate environment and decline in the lower rate david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp okay and then just in terms of the nii guide staying the same although maybe moving to the higher end of the range how that works with there being fewer cuts and the better outlook for loan growth dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i mean its up yeah i mean fewer rate cuts that results in a higher number because were not going to get the compression on the way down and then kind of the volume element weve kind of talked about as we deploy the billion in deposits that we got in  and what were the additional of these billion that were looking for for the rest of the year into at least on a prospective basis into higher yielding assets rather than into kind of shortterm securities that satisfy high quality liquid asset requirements kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp it will build quartertoquarter with a slight improvement in  as we put the loans out and then it begins to grow stronger in  and  operator thank you the next question comes from the line of brandon king with truist securities brandon please go ahead brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey so i understand nim is supposed to trough in the second quarter just given the hqla build at the end of the first quarter but could you quantify particularly how much nim compression youre expecting for the second quarter dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so as we dipped down bps in  from  you saw that i think we can get down another bps on higher volumes brandon king q analyst truist securities inc western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2024 okay and then the expectation is that as you throughout the second half of the year if rates stay i guess stable from here you had midsingle digit expansion quarteroverquarter thats correct right dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah we look for it to increase because the marginal spread that were going to pick up between deposits and loans say were lending out at of the increase in deposits thats going to be accretive to the margin overall operator thank you the next question comes from the line of gary tenner with da davidson your line is now open gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co thanks good morning i had another followup on the credit side of things if i look at the total classified increase a little over million in the quarter the investor cre side inclusive of lower hotel and increase in office was basically flat but the delta was a little more on the ci side so i just wonder if you could comment about within the ci book what youre experiencing there were any particular business lines that were weaker and got more movement this quarter timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp sure thanks tim again okay our portfolio remains stable we remain vigilant in this elevated interest rate environment but were really seeing stable performance across all the segments outside of the more pronounced movements that weve talked about in office really any other movements that we see are idiosyncratic and related to a specific business not a trend in a portfolio gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co thanks tim and then just one question on the income statement the service charge line down about half versus the fourth quarter and kind of where it run previous to that can you remind us what happened there and thoughts going forward dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah weve had elevated service charges here for a little bit they came down in  i think theyre going to remain lower until we have more followon execution of some things were doing in service charges in basically the regions operator thank you the next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc jon please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning couple of quick ones here dale used the term on the mortgagerelated deposits that you reacquired billion that was a big chunk of the growth what do you mean by that and are you kind of signaling that deposits flattened out or maybe declined a bit in  just so we understand that western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2024 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp what i mean is that so the mortgage warehouse deposits primarily come from two sources one is principal and interest and those are on a monthly cycle as we get fixed funds in from mortgage payments and then we remit them to the gses some three weeks later and so you get this kind of intramonth kind of sinewave regarding the taxes and insurance though thats a longer cycle and particularly i think taxes are usually semiannual some are annual and so we have a dip from tax payments property taxes in those deposits and its very pronounced in the fourth quarter thats what really drove that number lower from where we were at september 30th and so we say reacquired in terms of those those funds are then depleted as they are paid through the taxing agency and then they start building up again and they build up quickly and frankly we brought in some other clients there too which kind of helped to boost it up because normally it wouldnt have recovered quite that quickly youd have to be in the second quarter to do it but that didnt happen kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp what was announced in  came back in  jon a little stronger than we thought because we had some market share wins at the end of last year that began to finance fund up in  and thats what dale means jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay thanks on that its just bigger than i thought and that helps me understand that ken you mentioned very early in your prepared comments an upper teen return on tangible is your goal how do you view the sustainability of that i mean if you can do that the stock goes up but is that the key metric you look at and what do you think about sustainability of that longerterm kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah well we wouldnt have put it in there if we didnt think that we had a high confidence level of getting there itll build up through and again everything we talked about on the last earnings call and this one is about the earnings exit or velocity rate out of into now that return could actually spike up in the event that the fed does take some more actions and reduces rates and then youll see a greater share of fee income come from amerihome right now we kind of have that at a basic steady state of where it is today but rates come down say basis points over the next four quarters or whatever you can see amerihome really gearing up and producing far more income and generating a higher return on equity for the entire company operator thank you the next question comes from the line of erik zwick with hovde group your line is now open erik zwick q analyst hovde group llc good morning everyone a quick followup question maybe kind of a multipart question regarding your loans that are secured by real estate collateral first im just curious how often are the individual property valuations refreshed and what percentage of your portfolio has received updated valuations say in the past six months and the reason i guess im asking is that cre transaction volume has in certain markets has been somewhat muted in recent quarters and that can potentially obscure or slow market recognition of changes in values in western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2024 either direction right up or down but with current concerns that higher rates put pressure on values how comfortable are you that the valuations youre currently using and reserving against are reflective of current market valuations timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp sure thanks thats a good question ill take it tim again okay so a couple of things just to level set were a bridge and construction lender in commercial real estate okay so there isnt a scenario here where we have term loans that were waiting for a maturity to look at or theyre benefiting from a longterm fixed rate that was put in place in a different environment these are floating rate loans and we value them against appraisal and performance on an ongoing basis all of our documentation includes terms for reappraisal and remargin so those thoughts around value are critical to us and that isnt something that we wait for a default or a maturity to handle additionally we have substantial submarket data that we track to track trends in value but in advance of that were tracking the trends in submarket occupancy so that we can really understand how that will translate to the value in situations when there is limited market sale activity erik zwick q analyst hovde group llc thanks tim i appreciate your color thats all for me today operator thank you the final question comes from the line of zach westerlind with ubs zach please go ahead zachary westerlind q analyst ubs securities llc hi just a quick followup on the ecrs dale i know you said that you guys are trying to get ahead of those kind of higher cost accounts do you think that the beta on the ecr rate on the way down when the fed start cutting do you think that could be equal to or exceed the beta that we saw on the way up dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i mean you have to kind of segment that into what types of ecrs there are within the mortgage warehouse side yes i think were going to be at or near perhaps even over for some time but in total itll be lower than that as we use ecrs for hoa deposits as well but those start at a much lower rate to begin with so i do think that well be at least as fast as we were on the way up on the way down and maybe in some cases even a bit better zachary westerlind q analyst ubs securities llc understood thank you operator thank you i would now like to hand the call over to ken vecchione for closing remarks kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal
