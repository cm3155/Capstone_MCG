call over to ken vecchione please go ahead kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation good afternoon and welcome to western alliances second quarter earnings call joining me on the call today are dale gibbons and tim bruckner our chief financial officer and chief credit officer i will first provide an overview of our quarterly results and how we are managing the business in this current economic environment and then dale will walk you through the banks financial performance afterwards we will open the line to take your questions i would like to focus on three trends that were present in this quarter and will continue throughout the year ppnr strength credit provisioning expense and balance sheet growth combined these trends will support earnings and capital growth and dividend distribution throughout and starting with our second quarter results western alliance generated net income of million and eps of which was up over the previous quarter tangible book value per share of was an increase of over the previous quarter and yearoveryear driving these results was record operating pre provision net revenue of million up yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter with strong operating ppnr roa growth of basis points to which benefited from a recognition of million in payment protection program net fees these results demonstrate that the longterm earnings power of western alliances core business remains strong under the current economic and market volatility and will support significant ongoing capital accumulation provide financial flexibility to fund balance sheet growth and accommodate changes to the allowance for credit losses for revisions to the economic outlook in the quarter we recorded provision for credit losses of million versus million in  which was primarily attributable to changes in macroeconomic forecast assumptions and net chargeoffs of million dale will go into more detail in a bit on the specific drivers of our provisions but our total loan acltofunded loan ratio now stands at or million continuing our strong balance sheet momentum from loans increased billion this quarter to billion and deposits grew billion to billion without the inclusion of ppp loans grew a more modest million and deposits demonstrated strong growth of approximately billion the lower adjusted loan growth reflects muted demand for which we held back on marketing activities and directed our focus to lowloss highquality loan segments in addition to assisting our clients with their ppp applications we are encouraged by our pipeline and our opportunity to continue to grow in lowrisk asset classes throughout the crisis we have continued to attract new highquality relationships to our bank at pricing and terms that would not have been available to us in other circumstances furthermore this quarters positive operating leverage supported our expanding ppnr as our strong efficiency ratio improved sharply to compared to prior year becoming more efficient during this economic uncertainty provides the incremental flexibility to maintain ppnr looking ahead we will continue to invest in new product offerings and infrastructure to maintain operational efficiency but  levels are temporary and will eventually rise back to a sustainable level in the low however our branchlight business model and our national business line strategy continue to give us a competitive advantage western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 finally supported by our healthy ppnr generation western alliance remains well capitalized with a cet1 ratio of which puts us in a position of strength uniquely prepared to address whats ahead in this uncertain environment now lets take a moment to provide an update on western alliances response to the covid pandemic first and foremost i want to acknowledge the health and safety of our people and clients are of our utmost concern we continue to follow cdc protocol and statebystate returntowork guidance as our organization returns to the office our business continuity plans have been working as anticipated and i want to thank all of our people who continue to go above the call of duty to get the job done and serve our clients in this unique environment as i initially described in our  earnings call wals unique credit risk management strategy is focused on establishing individual borrowerlevel strategies and direct customer dialogue to develop longterm financial plans our approach to payment deferral request is to look for resourceful ways to partner with our clients along with assessing their willingness and capacity to support their business interests we ask our clients to work handin hand with us whereby our clients contribute liquidity capital or equity as an integral component to modify payment plans our approach collectively uses the resources of the borrower government and banks balance sheet to develop solutions that extend beyond the sixmonth window provided for the cares act since april wal has funded billion of ppp loans which provided an expedient liquidity to over clients and benefited more than employees at quarter end billion or of loans have been modified with the bulk of these loans received in principal and interest deferrals excluding the hotel franchise finance segment in which we executed a unique sector deferral strategy the bankwide deferral rate is approximately the vast majority of our borrowers elected to utilize their own resources or ppp funds to bridge their business through the covid crisis i will provide an update on the portfolios most impacted by covid later on but i do want to highlight in our hotel franchise finance portfolio our sophisticated hotel sponsors continue to see value in and support their properties with of deferrals achieved by posting additional liquidity as a component of future payment deferrals our differentiated deferral strategy provides our customers a runway to resolve their liquidity issues and allow the appropriate time to recover unlike the cookiecutter big bank approach we established the expectation that the burden of responsibility of solving the longterm cash flow problems remains with our client base in our gaming book all borrowers continue to make interest payments as 90day principalonly deferrals were approved for of the portfolio today of our clients are open for business and are experiencing a strong rebound of demand these facts and the daily conversations with our people and clients help me feel confident that our credit mitigation strategy and early approach to proactively managing our risk segments is bearing fruit and puts western alliance in a strong position to come out on the other side of the pandemic in better shape than our peers dale will now take you through our financial performance dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation thanks ken over the last three months western alliance generated net income of million or per share as mentioned net income was impacted by elevated provision expense for credit losses driven by the adoption of cecl in  and changes in the economic outlook during the quarter net interest income increased million primarily as a result of loan growth and lower rates and liabilities as interest expense was cut in half operating noninterest income fell million to million from the prior quarter as lower levels of financial western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 activity generated lower fewer fees we also benefited from several nonoperating items during the period including a recovery of approximately or million of the marktomarket loss on preferred stock holdings we recognized in  additionally bankowned life insurance was restructured resulting in an increase of million as we surrendered and reinvested lower yielding policies in addition to this gain this should moderately increase full year revenue prospectively finally noninterest expense declined million primarily from an increase in deferred compensation expense of million related to ppp loan originations plus a decrease in deposit costs and a decline in business development and travel expenses strong ongoing balance sheet momentum coupled with diligent expense management drove operating pre provision net revenue of million was up year over year we believe its the most relevant metric to evaluate the ongoing earnings power of the bank our strong ppnr covered an increase in provision cost from  to million while driving eps up to on a linkedquarter basis turning now to our interest drivers investment yields increased basis points from the prior quarter to however the overall quarterly portfolio yield decreased by basis points from the prior year due to the lower rate environment loan yields decreased basis points following declines across most loan types mainly driven by the basis point reduction in onemonth libor during the quarter yield reductions were partly offset by an average yield on our ppp loans of prospectively we expect loan yields to trend toward the endofquarter spot rate shown of interestbearing deposit costs fell by basis points in  to basis points as this quarter received the full benefit of our proactive steps taken to reduce deposit rates immediately after the fomc cut rates twice in march the spot rate of total deposits at quarter end was basis points total funding costs declined by basis points when all of the companys funding sources are considered including noninterestbearing deposits and borrowings the spot rate on total funding costs of basis points is higher than the quarterly average due to the issuance of subordinated debt midquarter at we expect funding costs to have stabilized at these levels as no further debt actions are anticipated demonstrating the flexibility of our business model despite a transition to a substantially lower rate environment during the quarter net interest income rose or million during  to million up yearover year our origination of ppp loans coupled with strong balance sheet growth and immediate steps taken to reduce the cost of interestbearing deposits counteracted the decline in prime and libor ppp lending supported our net interest margin during  as sba fees were recognized resulting in a loan yield of in this sector we estimate most of ppp loans will be forgiven within eight months from origination of the million in ppp loan fees we received from the sba net of origination costs or million was recognized in the second quarter net interest margin contracted basis points to during the quarter as our earning asset yields fell basis points but was offset by an equal improvement in funding costs our outsized deposit growth and mounting cash reserves will continue to place downward pressure on the nim until excess liquidity can be deployed which we expect will take two to three quarters with regards with our asset sensitivity our rate risk profile has declined notably over the past over last year and we are now asymmetrically positioned to benefit from any future rate increases as of our loan portfolio is behaving as a fixed rate since floors on variable rate loans have largely been triggered our estimated net change of net interest income and a basis point parallel shock higher is over the next year and we now project zero net interest income at risk if rates move lower western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 turning now to operating efficiency on a linkedquarter basis our efficiency ratio improved basis points to which continues to demonstrate our industryleading operating leverage as mentioned earlier the non interest expense improvement is related to an increase in deferred compensation expense of million and related ppp loan originations plus a reduction in deposit costs and a decrease in development and travel costs normalizing for ppp net loan fees and interests the efficiency ratio for  would have been additionally our branchlight model has given us the flexibility to identify two locations that we are transitioning from full service offices to loan production facilities our core underlying earnings power remains strong as preprovision net revenue roa increased basis points from the prior quarter to and return on assets was flat at while we expect the is a high watermark as elevated liquidity will hold down the margin we believe we will continue to maintain industryleading performance this provides a significant flexibility to fund ongoing balance sheet growth capital management actions or any credit demand our balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans increased billion to billion and this deposit growth of billion brought our deposit balances to billion at quarter end the loantodeposit ratio fell to from in  as our strong liquidity position continues to provide us with balance sheet capacity to meet all funding needs our cash position increased to billion as deposit growth continues to outpace credit expansion while this impairs the margin near term we believe it provides us with inventory for good credit growth as demand resumes of note during the quarter we issued million of banklevel subordinated debt to ensure ample capacity to support our growth trajectory by bolstering our total capital ratio finally tangible book value per share increased over the prior quarter to an increase of or over the prior year the vast majority of the billion in loan growth was driven by increases in ci loans of billion residential loans of million and construction loans of million residential and consumer loans now comprise of our loan portfolio while our construction loan concentration continues to trend downward and is now at of total loans excluding ppp loans loan growth was million which was affected by line paydowns from draws during  and offset by growth in residential and construction highlighting our continued focus on growth and lowrisk assets tech and innovation loans were flat in total while within the category capital call and subscription lines grew million mortgage warehouse loans grew million and residential mortgages grew million corporate finance loans decreased million compared to the increase we saw in  as borrowers repaid their line draws reducing utilization rates down from to and our loan growth was fully funded by deposit growth we continue to believe our ability to profitably grow deposits is both a key differentiator and a core value driver to our firms longterm value creation notably yeartodate deposit growth of billion is higher than the annual deposit growth of the company in any previous calendar year deposits grew billion or in the second quarter driven by increases in noninterestbearing ddas of billion which now comprise over of our deposit base ppp loanrelated deposits grew billion and savings and money market accounts were up million hoa has contributed to total deposit growth by adding million and tech and innovation increased million as capital raising activity during the quarter was active excluding ppprelated deposits growth would have been billion or regarding asset quality special mention loans increased million and nonperforming loans rose million during the quarter onehalf of the increase in sm loans are from the hotel portfolio generally consistent with our western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 previouslydiscussed tech and innovation rating guidelines these loans were downgraded as we do not have clear line of sight to more than six months of remaining operating liquidity these borrowers are current however as they made loan prepayments that will be required for us to consent to a deferral modification our other borrowers in this segment are also paying as agreed or providing cash payments that when coupled with the payment deferral have no additional debt service requirement until sometime in second weve aggregated an event planning and leisure subsegment in which the business models are essentially dependent on social distancing relief and in some cases the resumption of group events of the million total exposure to this sector million has been moved to special mention and million to non performing while portion moved to sm has over a year of current liquidity it was downgraded as the revenue models have been sharply impaired the loan move to nonperforming has had now has limited remaining liquidity the remainder of the migration to special mention is fairly granular from our client spreads throughout our metropolitan markets where liquidity has been tightened these loans are generally collateralized by an array of assets that include real property frequently a loan may be downgraded to sm because of liquidity concerns even though collateral coverage may be considerable for this reason migration to special mention has a low correlation to ultimate credit losses as over the past five years less than has moved through to chargeoffs our allowance for credit losses rose million during the quarter as the change in mix of the balance sheet released million of reserves and changes to the outlook accounted for million including covering million of net chargeoffs revisions to the cecl macroeconomic outlook assumptions which have declined since march but have generally stabilized since april accounted for the entire net reserve build the indiscernible allowance related to loan losses was million excluding heldtomaturity securities or of funded loans an increase of basis points the current reserve build reflects our best estimate of the future economic environment as of quarter end including the impact of government stimulus programs and credit migration actions we have migrated to a consensus economic outlook of blue chip economic forecasts as it tracks largely managements view of the recession and recovery net credit losses of million were recognized during the quarter which were mainly attributable to small business and ci borrowers in all total loan acl to funded loans increased basis points to in  as provision expense for loans losses of million significantly outpaced net loan chargeoffs relative to most other banking companies our lower consumer exposure continues to result in lower total loan losses ill now turn the call back to ken kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation thanks dale i would now like to briefly update you on the current status of a few exposures to the industries generally considered to be the most impacted by the covid19 pandemic during the last two weeks of the quarter tim bruckner the credit administration team and i conducted the most extensive quarterly portfolio review process in the banks history the review covered of wals outstanding loan balances excluding purchase residential mortgages our billion hotel franchise finance business focused on selectservice hotels represents approximately of the loan portfolio the financial flexibility of these borrowers is maximized by working with financially strong institutional operating partners with deep industry experience expertise and conservative underwriting structures focused on loantocost western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 occupancy rates are tracking national averages currently around which have tripled compared to the lows in april of around and are now only a few percentage points short of fully covering estimated operating expenses at approximately occupancy selectservice hotels are also estimated to cover amortizing debt service as a testament to the operating models of the selectservice hotels revenue per available room has fallen but they have been able to shrink their cost structure by over and as a result the typical hotel is operating at breakeven nearly of our hotel portfolio is either paying as originally agreed or on a proactive payment deferral plans that bridge into we feel positive about the trajectory of the portfolio and that our proactive deferral strategy will produce relatively stronger credit performance given the active support of our sponsors have demonstrated through the material upfront payments made to receive deferral plans to augment the strategy we nearly doubled the reserve of the portfolio this quarter and increased the acltoloans ratio by basis points to the investordependent portion of our technology innovation segment is primarily focused on lending to establish growth companies with successful products and strong investor support which provides greater operating and financial flexibility in this environment overall a significant sponsor support and an active fundraising environment continue for these growth firms of loans have greater than six months remaining months liquidity up from in  additionally we have had over clients successfully raise over billion in new capital since march our million gaming book is focused on offstrip middle market gaminglinked companies whose revenue is driven by local demand factors of the portfolio use our 90day principalonly payment deferral as they continue to cover interest payments additionally these clients benefited from million of ppp loans inclusive of our recent closure mandates in nevada to limit certain business activities businesses representing of the portfolio are open for operations upon reopening all casinos borrowers are performing at or above their covid operating plan and no loans were downgraded to criticize or classify at quarter end lastly our commercial real estate portfolio continues to perform as of our industrial leases are current of our office rents are paid on par with the national average the subsegment of cre that is showing signs of stress for the industry is retail wals cre retail exposure of million is focused on local personal service based retail strip centers with limited merchandise retail exposure similar to hff we are utilizing deferrals to support a path to recovery for these borrowers while requiring demonstrated sponsor support with high level of additional payment reserves of note of wabs investor cre retail tenants paid mays rent payments compared to nationally we continue to generate significant capital and maintain strong regulatory capital ratios with tangible common equity to total assets of and a common tier ratio of an increase of basis points during the quarter excluding ppp loans tce to tangible assets was flat from  at inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment of per share our tangible book value per share rose in the quarter to an increase of in the past year we continue to grow our tangible book value per share at a rate significantly faster than our peers as it has increased times that of our peers over the last years in conclusion we expect loan growth to be fairly flat in  as ppp payoffs and forgivenesses are largely offset by the organic growth in low risk asset classes depending on the timing of the realized ppp forgiveness organic loan growth should offset ppp runoff resulting in net loan growth being relatively stable we anticipate another strong quarter of deposit growth in  primarily by executing on our deposit initiatives and achieving our market share gains in mortgage warehouse the anticipated deposit growth and resulting liquidity will primarily be deployed into residential mortgage assets to improve returns on cash over the next several quarters however as western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 ppp loans roll off and liquidity continues to rise pressure on nim will also continue until it can be fully deployed into productive assets while we are pleased with our deposit growth the pace is exceeding loan growth and as dale mentioned it will take several quarters to redeploy this liquidity into lowrisk loans or assets providing yields greater than the feds current offering operating ppnr is expected to decline modestly as ppp income begins to abate loan balances growth grow begin growth begins to reignite and the deployment of excess liquidity continues and deferral of loan origination costs return to normal levels our longterm asset quality and loan loss reserves are informed by the economic consensus forecast which should consistent going forward should preclude material increases in reserve levels from this point the pace timing and size of future net chargeoffs are uncertain to us as we have not seen a material increase in delinquencies or substandard migration finally our strong capital base and access to ample liquidity will allow us to both take advantage of any market dislocations to grow in lowrisk areas and to address any credit demands in the future at this time dale tim and i are happy to take your questions question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions operator instructions the first question today comes from casey haire of jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning guys kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation hi casey haire q analyst jefferies llc so first question on the hotel book the deferral strategy of you guys there looks its more than six months can you just give us some color on what the average term is and how far in advance have you guys deferred these and then what is the occupancy sounds like it is near sort of breakeven levels what is in your reserve build forecast going forward do you have it reaching reaching that level just some color there given that this obviously is of concern kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah i think the hotel franchise finance book of business is the most misunderstood and our approach is not fully understood as well so let me take a half step backwards and give you a larger picture of as to what were doing and why were doing it and then get directly to your questions there casey one the first misconception is deferrals are a good thing okay payment deferrals require cash collateral or pay down of debt upfront they prove or provide liquidity to the project they show from the borrowers point of view western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 project commitment which is very important or they flush out any early problems we need to deal with so when we say we have a sixplussix program what that means is our borrower gave us six months of payments upfront that we deposited into a bank account which we pull out on a monthly basis as debt service coverage ratio debt service coverage is due that are paid principal and interest i should say is due and they dont get to their six month deferral process until six months from today so thats what six plus six means all right and what were trying to do here as we look for people who provide the liquidity and commit to the projects again it helps us understand if they do not want to do those things then we need to take fast action to preserve the of equity thats sitting in front of our debt that is the philosophy around our approach a specific answer to your question today about of our portfolio is in the sixplussix deferral bucket is in the threeplusthree bucket about is in the as paid as agreed and another is in the threeplussix bucket and then weve got a whole bunch of other plans five plus five two plus two all those type of plans depending on the particular borrower and that amounts to about so all in about of our hotel book is paying as agreed or is on a deferral program now we ph saw of about that were in the process of documenting and we expect that to fall into any one of the buckets i just described but all in overall of our hotel book is paying as agreed even if theyre on a deferral because we are attaching those funds that are sitting at a bank account where they provided the liquidity upfront the other specific question you ask is let me just give you some of the numbers here for us the current occupancy is about that is three times higher than the lows in march the adr is that too is three times higher than march we did say at based on our book of business here that the company is breakeven on an operating basis and at the company does begin or the book of business does begin to cash flow on a onetoone ratio inclusive of amortization okay i think that addressed all of your questions timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer executive vice president western alliance bancorporation i would add a couple of things its tim bruckner first id say this was not the easiest thing to execute i dont want to downplay that the this took a concerted effort of our people and initial discussions with borrowers were difficult because were solving for a period significantly longer than most viewed covid in the first days of the crisis and so we went out from the start and said lets solve for periods sufficient to return to stabilization and thats what we did and we solved that not just with our money and our deferral but with contributions from our very significant sponsorship in that space we did it because it was the right thing to do our borrowers did it because they could do it and i think thats a very important point on this and we have so many now that come back and say im so glad that we took this approach kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation so of our portfolio slightly more will have to deal with these issues again in the middle of all right another timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer executive vice president western alliance bancorporation kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 sorry another or so well deal with towards the end of the year okay so weve given enough of a runway here this was the most important thing that we can do to help our clients is to give them a long runway to come back up to the operating levels that they previously experienced initially as tim said they resisted but once they talked to us once they saw what was happening they saw some of the wisdom in the approach that we deployed casey did i answer your questions there casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah yeah yeah no that was pretty comprehensive ill have to go back and reread it myself but that was ph fabulous dale a question for you on the nim slide by my math on the spot rates it looks like its about it exited the quarter at just does that sound about right number one and then number two what is that loan yield spot rate of what does that presume for the ppp loans at in the quarter on thats a lot higher than what weve seen from peers so just some color there dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah so that assumes for the quarter as well so what we did in terms of recognizing ppp revenue is weve estimated doing the effective interest method and gaap how long are these loans going to last and from information what we have and what our borrowers are thinking and how theyre behaving we think the average life of these is going to be about eight months and so were taking the ppp average loan fee which is about and were recognizing of that really over this eight month and then theres a tail for the part that might not pay off so you should expect us to show something of a level loan yield on the ppps and i think some other are doing maybe a little different approach i would hope that our number would be on the higher side of where you are in the higher for the quarter but frankly it kind of remains to be seen a bit i mean weve had this massive increase in core deposits we think that were on track for another strong quarter of core deposit growth in the third quarter while the loan balances wont be moving as much because were dealing with the paydowns on ppp as we originate credit in other highquality categories so thats going to help us in terms of inventory build but it doesnt help us in terms of the nim but we think thats going to be really important in casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thank you ill step back operator the next question comes from brad milsaps of piper sandler please go ahead brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation good morning western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation good morning brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co dale just wanted to make sure i understand the ppps on a goforward basis billion of loans should imply million in gross fees i think you mentioned that net of the net of origination costs you had about million less you recognized about million this quarter can you help me understand with the geography of where some of those fees will show up in terms of nii versus a reduction in operating expenses going forward i mean i think youll get to the same place overall but maybe starting from a little lower point than i thought dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah thats i think thats probably the biggest delta so we did billion or just under billion billion in loans we had some people surrender at a couple of early pays and so that number is down to about billion today we received fees of million from the sba now million and then we netted certain costs against that and thats how we get to the million going forward im not looking for any cost release obviously because the origination process has ended but im not looking for but so the million that we highlighted in the release yeah i think thats going to come back up in compensation expense so that is going to rise again and then the remaining so that gets to a net million we took of that in the second quarter well probably going to take another of that in the third quarter and then were going to have a tail end to the fourth and maybe a dribble down a little bit into the first of next year in terms of the kind of recognition so i think two things one is maybe the dollar amount was a little bit higher because some of these were very short term or refunded and then two the average loan fee was shy of it was about brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co okay so bottom line you still got million to recognize most of thats going to come through net interest income dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation that will all come through net interest income brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co got it got it understood and then just to follow up on the margin you noted in the deck youve got of the loan book essentially acting at a fixed rate thus far i mean i know its early but how challenging has it been able to defend some of those floors obviously theres probably now a lot of loans moving from bank to bank right now so just kind of curious kind of your thoughts on being able to defend those loan floors as we kind of move through the year dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 yeah actually it has been less challenging than it has been in other downward environments and i would tell you that today and this is unusual i mean two to three years ago when we put on a loan with a floor wed have the loan docs are in there and of course is disclosed and discussed with the borrower but it triggers to basis points below the variable rate and so its like oh its a little bit of an afterthought its probably not going to hit me most people dont think loans or rates are going to plummet as they did today thats not the case today how we are reducing our rate is its usually at a libor floor assumption of well libor is under basis points today so we did go in knowing okay this loan is priced at l plus and l is never considered to be below so out of the gate the floors looks active and its going to be active for until libor gets above and then we can go to a variable rate structure kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation surprisingly were not losing business because of the floors brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co got it and then final question just looking through some of the segment data i did notice there was a look like a negative provision in the other nbl category in the quarter that reserve actually went down any color there kind of relative to kind of what you did with the rest of the portfolio dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah its not so much a portfolio thing is that when we updated for the cecl outlook and the migration from mark zandis analysis to a consensus forecast it resulted in different allocations for certain sectors and ci loans in particular kind of came down in part in that regard brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co okay great thank you operator the next question today comes from timur braziler of wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning guys kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe we can start on the credit migration into special mention this quarter it certainly didnt seem like that was the primary reason for the second quarter provision i guess looking ahead how should we thing about future credit migration relative to the current allowance if theres future migration in the special mention is that already western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 pretty much included in the existing expectations and i guess more specifically if theres migration out of special mention and into classified would that drive incremental necessity to build allowance from here dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah so as i kind of alluded to the loss rates for sm loans does not have a high correlation in terms of migration and thats reflected in our formulas we dont see that in the math and in the emergence of loss and so migration to sm is usually driven by a liquidity question so even if we had a loan that was at a loan to value but theres a liquidity tightening going on at that borrower thats going to go to sm even though the risk of loss most people would say will be essentially zero so in terms of what could migrate to sm i think we kind of highlighted that we thought wed see some sm migration in the hotel book because theyre under liquidity stress as those as the occupancy rates really dropped in that quarter now if you go from there to classified or to nonperforming it has become a different category and those loss assumptions do generally climb when we moved to a classified asset were going to look at the collateral behind it and were going to recognize a reserve based upon are we under water or not relative to expectation so that could be a different result but sm migration really has almost no effect on provisioning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful thank you and then maybe switching to the technology portfolio certainly encouraging to see that over clients over billion was raised in the quarter im looking specifically at the of tech loans last quarter that had under six months of liquidity were those included in that billion of capital raising activity and i guess those companies that are coming up to that kind of a deadline are they having as easy success raising incremental rounds and whats happening to the valuations if they are kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah so some of that money was raised for those customers that were in sm last quarter that were able to raise their raise liquidity and then move out thats a constant number that kind of moves in and moves out relatively speaking the tech and innovation book stayed relatively flat in terms of the sm movement so that was very encouraging to me because it means that the investors are continuing to be confident in the projects or investments theyve made and are continuing to put capital into their companies so i hope that timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer executive vice president western alliance bancorporation i would add just tim bruckner quarteroverquarter we actually saw improvements in businesses with rml less than six months if you look quarter one to quarter two and so what were seeing is a high level of activity in some cases the rounds are smaller but were seeing sustained sponsor support and really strong activity in the sector so quarteroverquarter rml licensing improved  to  kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah ill give you two pieces of interesting facts about our book for the tech and innovation the medium equity invested in our portfolios is times our loan commitment today and it is times the current outstanding loan balance so it gives you a sense of how much equity is going into the companies and also of the fact that even though we give a commitment about half of that commitment is not drawing down on at all because they have so western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 much equity and that leads us to why we have to times depending on what time of the year you look at deposits to loans in the tech and innovation business timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it and then in the gaming book i guess im kind of surprised to see the level of allowance allocated to that portfolio relative to currently adversely graded loans is that an indication that things could still get choppy in the future or is that formulaic as it didnt seem like there was much expected lost content from your prepared remarks kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah so first we have no las vegas trip exposure okay and we mostly have drive to and local markets and whats interesting here is they are outperforming the same period of in their initial reopenings so may was better than may all right we do have one or two properties where theyre just performing at covid ph plan and that is not thats the worst that we can say and were pretty happy about that some of our gaming establishments are posting win per day at their slot machines that are three times the normal average level all right so in this book we have of the book has had an interestonly deferral we have not had any principal deferrals part of what you see in our calculation is manually driven by the model of course there are some subjective input put in on top overlays for what we think is occurring in our book of business but our book has a fairly strong or i should say lower leverage than you think generally the leverage in our book is just under times debt to ebitda you go back to the last prices and anything over a or under to times debt to ebitda had a survival rate so right now we like our book is doing well we are encouraged that there is a return here by our gaming clients customers and i also think it shows well for that when the economy opens up again how quickly people want to come back out and socialize and be in settings with other people dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah i mean i think part of what youre referring to timur is basically the process of using formulas that were developed during the financial crisis and extrapolating them to today which has a different circumstance and a different underwriting and a different kind of risk profile entirely with of our properties open and what were seeing in the low ltv we are in this sector i would put my bet that when were done with this pandemic and we look past look backward in terms of what happened the acl in this sector will have been shown to be higher than it needed to be timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thank you timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer executive vice president western alliance bancorporation i might add western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc sorry go ahead timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer executive vice president western alliance bancorporation its tim bruckner ill just add the pace of all these things and the currency of these events were seeing in late may and then in june theres very robust response to the industry the high volumes and though very very positive as dale was saying the acl is based on historical were seeing results that are outperforming what we have seen historically and thats another way to look at it timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc understood thank you and then just sorry one more modeling question for dale just the average ppp loans for the quarter dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation im sorry what was that the average ppp timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc average ppp balances for the quarter dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation billion timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator the next question comes from chris mcgratty of kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for the question dale or ken just wanted to go back to loan growth for a second i completely understand the nearterm lowrisk growth strategy and ppp dynamic perhaps should last a couple of quarters im wondering kind of your thoughts on how we should be thinking about loan growth beyond maybe the next couple of quarters and remind us kind of the targets that youre setting forth for growth kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah so i think as i said in my prepared remarks itll be somewhat stable to where we are now when you consider the runoff of the ppp as dale talked about being replaced by our traditional organic loan growth as we western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 emerge out of  we havent done our full planning yet but i would think that its going to be no less than what we normally do which is million to million per quarter right now i am encouraged that our pipeline is beginning to build and i arrived at that conclusion by looking at the number of loans that come into our senior loan committee all right those are the largest loans in the bank theyre coming in with from what ill call brand name companies that you would know very well at better terms okay and at better pricing and so we are encouraged by that right now that we have to wait for those loans to be approved and we have to of course wait for them to be drawn down but as we emerge out of  i would think were back to our normal run rate of million to million a quarter and well update you as we get closer into  as we normally do for the next year outlook dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation i think this is going to firstly depend upon what happens to the situation i mean ive been encouraged by what seems to be a number of firms worldwide that claim to have an efficacious vaccine and if thats the case and if that is a rollout around the end of this year maybe into  i think that puts confidence in a different level and i think wed have the background and were ready with the infrastructure and weve got the deposit capacity that well be able to take advantage of an increase in demand as confidence resumes christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats great dale in terms of deposits so it sounds like loan growth indiscernible until the end of the year and then resumption the comments about deposit growth just coming in if i take out the ppp of billion you still grew billion or so in the quarter can you just help us with the magnitude of what youre likely to see in  and  just how big is the balance sheet going to be i guess im trying to get my arms around dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation well its not going to replicate what we did in the first half of the year but were getting traction in our specialty business lines were getting traction in mortgage warehouse were getting traction in homeowner associations and were getting traction in tech place and all of those have demonstrated historical momentum and the queue is good for what were seeing coming in christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great and then if i could sneak one last one in i just want to make sure i got the expense outlook right so the deposit cost came down to is that the right run rate that we should be using from here dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation i think thats fair christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then the moving piece is with the ppp comp how do we think about just the overall expense the expenses you were kind of flat quarteronquarter but i know youre making some investments but any kind of direction of expenses western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah i mean were at million that included a credit for ppp originations of course were not doing any more ppp originations and as you mentioned were going to be fairly flattish with paydowns from that program and expectation of asset development elsewhere so i dont think were going to be below on efficiency for long and im not sure were going to go right back to i think that may be a little but i dont think there are many quarters that begin with a as we see that come back i mean some of the expenses we saved travel expenses business development thats really kind of the circumstance that were in today we do think that travel ph helps will help things close deals we think it and so were going to get back into that when thats feasible from a social distancing and state regulation scenario allows so yeah were going to be back and so i wouldnt look at the million id look more at the million where we were before in terms of something closer to our run rate christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats perfect thanks dale operator our next question comes from michael young of suntrust please go ahead michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey thanks for the question wanted to follow up first on the reserve i think thats gotten a lot of attention and had a lot of questions about it im trying to get to a more comparable figure to maybe other banks if we kind of backed out mortgage warehouse and maybe the large resi mortgage purchase portfolio and ppp loans and i think you guys might be more on par with other banks but i didnt know if there is a way to kind of disaggregate that where we could maybe see it on a more comparable basis kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation yeah this is talking our own book a little bit but when you think through our loan loss reserve and compare it to other banks first we always recognize that we dont have a consumer franchise and thats where a lot of losses will begin to mount thats number one number two i break our book into loan categories where weve had no losses resource finance for million capital call lines million hoa services million warehouse lending billion thats billion that weve never had a loss yet then weve got another billion where weve had limited losses in residential loans our consumer muni loans and nonprofit that too adds up to about billion so as you think about our funnel of billion you can take roughly billion almost off the top for either no or low losses now of course youre not going to do that but i think you can add a small percentage of basis points to cover your losses against that billion and then recalculate the reserve ratio and i think youll find that it will rise considerably above the another thing that i think is helpful for you to think through when you look at our book and this is how we look at it our construction land and development which is about billion the book there is looking very strong and it is responding and acting differently than the prior cycle first we have about of that book sitting in indiscernible banking all right and in indiscernible banking we have an ltv of about with a wellcapitalized highly liquid sponsors ie private equity or hedge funds that are backed that are our guarantors here so that book of business is performing very well we have no deferrals western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 there and in fact instead of getting deferral requests were getting just the opposite were getting incoming calls people saying you dont have to worry about me paying my bill but you have to be there when i see opportunities and thats an easy thing for us to say if youre making your payments as agreed to based on the terms that wed usually use well be there to help you so the cld book is somewhat different too and then on top of this and i know people like to go back and say wow what happened to western alliance in in and and draw from that some type of regression analysis but when you look at the prior cycle the credit physics if you will from the prior cycle to where we are today are completely different almost a full turnaround so in the prior cycle you had high unemployment okay that phase where we are today but the prior cycle you had high unemployment high delinquencies high charge offs low home prices you had a rising supply of home prices you had income dropping and you had demand dropping for these homes as well in the current cycle yes employment is higher than the prior cycle but you dont see the rise in delinquencies youre not seeing the rise in chargeoffs home prices are either flat to rising supply has not grown and income with the help of fiscal policies by the government income has risen and demand is higher so when we look at the appropriate reserve for construction land and development book we had to put all these overlays on top of the historic modeling that you would see in order to represent what we see happening in our book of business today so you put that together you also acknowledge that we have no energy loans we have limited restaurant loans we have very few solar loans all that stuff collectively together got us to our reserve calculation michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc that makes sense and just as we move forward i mean the main thing that would drive a big delta in the reserve would be losses in some of those historically low loss categories is that kind of the right way to think about that or would it be the more significant downgrades in other categories that have had historical losses in the past dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation well i mean effectively were in a scenario that you pay losses as incurred right your acl covers whats still in the book out there now if we had or if we had a loss in the category that previously has been zero loss and we expected it to have zero that would inform the analysis and the expectation of loss and whats still out there and gosh maybe you got that wrong maybe there was a defect in what youre doing there that is embedded in other loans and so in that sense it could drive a higher provision but for the most part its almost pay as you go and sustain your level of reserve based upon your outstanding balance and changes in the outlook of the economy michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and maybe just one last followup i think you guys have outlined a lot of detail on some of the most in focus loan segments but are there any other sort of tangential categories that we should have on our radar screen maybe ci relationship or something that might be related to one of the underlying categories just that we should be thinking about or that should be addressed dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 yeah i think thats a fair question and inside of our cre book we have three components to it we have industrial and there of our borrowers customers are paying their rent we feel comfortable there we have office there of our borrowers customers are paying rent rate but we have a cre book for retail about million just a touch over million there of our borrowers customers are paying rent compared to a national average now im not saying theres a problem there but you asked what are we focusing on and what has our elevated attention today that is an area that has our elevated attention we dont have to move quickly on it were watching it it has its got a very strong debt service coverage ratio coming into the downturn of times it has a very low ltv of we dont have much speculative loans there at all so im not i want to make sure im clear dont run away saying there was a problem you asked where were also watching that is an area that were watching michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thanks for all the color i appreciate it operator the next question comes from david chiaverini with wedbush securities please go ahead david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks my first question is on the mechanics of the deferral program if we use the sixandsix program as an example so the first six months theyre accruing interest you pull the pi from the accounts that they deposited in everythings normal but after the first six months as we get into what happens to those loans in terms of the treatment of it do they go on nonaccrual or do they move to special mention or classified im just curious as to whether or not theyll continue to accrue interest in the second half of the deferral period dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah no so the loan docs have been modified and so the contractual payments now allow for that theres no new payment done due until im going to say may of so youre right i mean we take the six months they paid upfront of pi and then we debit that and we recognize that liability and we pay paid the loan down over that six months then for the next six months what we do is payment regarding principal is deferred and interest payments that otherwise would have been due are now tacked on to principal due usually at the end of the maturity of the loan could be earlier could be a year out or two years out or something like that where thats going to become due again so were going to continue to accrue income and increase effectively the balance on that loan for the next six months it doesnt move to any classification unless we have information that theres another problem with the situation that has since developed but otherwise it would stay like that and then after that expires then theyre back to their standard pi payments as originally agreed timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer executive vice president western alliance bancorporation i might its tim bruckner i would add one just one thing on the interrelationship of our strategy and risk rating because i dont want this point to be missed we one its not thats not a direct relationship is the deferral in effect or not does not directly affect the risk rating the weekly dialogue with our borrower and verification of liquidity to work through that plan that is the important calculus in our risk rating methodology so all the time were in constant and ongoing dialogue with the borrower ensuring that theyre closing the gap and that theres sufficient liquidity through this cycle so if we get to a point where those mechanics change and we feel differently about that thats when we would affect the risk rating i want to be clear on it western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thats helpful and then shifting gears to the provision as we think about the third quarter and clearly theres a lot of uncertainty on the macro outlook but if we were to assume the macro outlook is stable from here you mentioned about how youre expecting flat or low loan growth what would that translate to in terms of provisioning are we thinking back towards i mean i dont want to be too optimistic and think of levels but what should we how should we think about provisioning over the next couple of quarters dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation well yeah i wouldnt go back to either but i would think that it would fall off fairly significantly and that is as you saw this quarter i mean the entire reserve increase in provision resulted from a deterioration in the outlook from march to the last mark zandi deal in the first quarter to where we are today so if thats fairly stable as im well be maybe as a bit of a pay as you go in terms of losses so if we incurred losses were going to recognize that if we have migration downward not into sm but into substandard and into nonperforming that could trigger additional provisioning requirements and chargeoffs but other than that if chargeoffs dont really materialize i think that number could drop rather dramatically actually over time david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks very much operator the next question will come from brock vandervliet of ubs please go ahead brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thanks most of my questions have been answered dale how did you kind of thread the needle with the especially in the hotel book the restructuring or the deferral that youve structured especially the longest term ones out to mid2021 how is that not a tdr dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation well so the kind of the special dispensation that came out from the frb extended that window a little bit so prior to that rule change banks could essentially do a 90day deferral on anything without having it fall into a restructuring so if theres some temporary hardship you can basically dole out over the life of a loan one 90day push out and thats been the case gosh since ive been doing this for decades what they allow is that you could instead for this for credits that have been impaired by the pandemic you can double that and you can take it six months and so thats all weve done is weve said okay well thats we can do six months so we will allow the longest you can go and not have it fall into a restructuring situation and then but then theyre paying again so the amount of time that they go on a deferral is within that window and within the guideline that was allowed because even though its a year theyve prepaid six months of it kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 yeah there is a brock ken here there is a difference between a solution to how we bridge the gap over the next year with them versus the deferral part so the solution is for a year the deferral is six months of that year and the other six months they give us the cash upfront brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it got it okay and any more color on that negative the negative provision you touched on it in one of the earlier questions and the one of the national businesses and i think there is a million in the hoa business it seemed just unusual timing this quarter dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation yeah yeah so again i mean we go through this process and when we have all these multiple regressions and then you come back and you look at it say okay is this helpful are we learning something about this or is something kind of overstated well the hoa loan portfolio is quite small and so it had been in kind of a separate category caught up in ci loans well when you look at the hoa loans on a standalone basis the idea that theyre going to have loss behavior anything like a ci loan or that kind of risk profile is really overstated i dont know im sure theres somebody somewhere i dont know anyone thats ever lost a dollar in an hoa loan because when you make an hoa loan if the hoa becomes delinquent you get to jump in front of the first position lender on whichever house it is in that hoa thats delinquent so if i dont pay my hoa fees and that causes my hoa association to not pay they can come after me and indiscernible in front of my first mortgage so your ltv on that loan is less than i mean thats just ridiculous thats just going to sit there forever so you get your money eventually and so a loss rate really on hoa loans should be darn near zero the reason why it wasnt originally is because it was embedded in large in a larger group of ci loans because it was so small highlighted that change and addressed it with segmenting that particular target brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay all right thanks for the color operator the next question comes from gary tenner of da davidson please go ahead gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co thanks good morning i just wanted to ask a question on the hotel deferral strategy ken i think you mentioned that you had some sponsors basically coming to you and saying im glad we did it this way the sixplussix that said im sure they all would have happily taken a sixmonth deferral without paying six months of accelerated cash so how can you be confident that kind of postcovid there is not any negative fallout in terms of business or relationship with some of these sponsors with the bank kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation okay i think thats a fair question of our book is with large sponsors and those are sponsors with or more hotels and they generally deal with about of their book is all connected to the top brands the marriott western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call 17jul2020 the hiltons the hyatts right and what they have seen from us is our deep knowledge of the industry and people like working with other folks that have an understanding of the knowledge of the industry im going to move to a different group for a second to highlight this as well we are gaining a lot of share in warehouse lending one of the most if i had to pinpoint the most familiar reason why were getting new customers is because our new customers are telling us that some of their incumbent banks dont understand the space the way we do and they dont want to be dependent upon a lender that doesnt understand the space and may do something irrational all right so back to hotel we dont we didnt do anything that was irrational we actually started with the relationship very early by saying you always need to have a lot of equity in this relationship thats the first thing we then worked through the models of course we make sure theres the right debt service coverage ratio make sure they have the right noi margins make sure theyve got a model that works in downtimes and youre seeing that now youre seeing the model work in downtimes as our customers are able to lower their adr and take market share from the lower brands all right and move that market share to their hotels because people would like to go to a nicer hotel for a lower price all right now all of those things connected together indicate that our customers like working with us and they know that we understand that market and i think what youre going to see here and this will play out over time so you can ask me this question six months or nine months from now assuming that the economy is returning to normal i think youre going to see a lot of our smaller competitors that just do one or two hotels here and there smaller banks i think theyre going to lose business to us because over the long term i think our clients want to deal with someone that know how to grow and by the way were still in business were not shutting down lending okay were not doing any right now because there are no deals but we have told our clients if youve got a good deal if you have an opportunity were there to finance you if you are working with us and showing commitment to your existing projects dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorporation i call this tough love because i dont think they didnt like it to begin with but i think its i think weve kind of earned some respect from some of them and the large majority of our borrowers have resources that are here for the longhaul kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorporation think of it this way there comes to a certain point where your kids think youre smart and all of a sudden your kids think youre really dumb and then they return to say boy how did my dad and mom get so smart again well i think this is what youre going to see with our clients theyre going to say gee we didnt agree with this approach at first but you know what these guys had a smart approach to this and it was a differentiated approach and what was interesting that people dont understand is it put our clients in front of us to talk to us all right before the other banks even had a conversation so a lot of these other banks did a 90day openended deferral cookie cutter you got it ill see you in days we came in with a solution we said wait a minute you have a bigger problem we have a bigger problem the industry has a bigger problem the economy has a bigger problem this is our viewpoint this is why we see this is how we see it playing out and good or bad at least they can respond to your viewpoint and your vision of tomorrow and how you want to solve for it western alliance bancorporation wal corrected transcript  earnings call
