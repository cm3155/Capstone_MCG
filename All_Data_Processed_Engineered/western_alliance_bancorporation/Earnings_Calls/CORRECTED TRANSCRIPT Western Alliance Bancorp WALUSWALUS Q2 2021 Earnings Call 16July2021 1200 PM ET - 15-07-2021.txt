position western alliance as one of the countrys premier growth commercial banks that can consistently generate leading balance sheet and earnings growth with superior asset quality across economic cycles this quarter the bank produced record net revenues ppnr and eps while expanding on net interest margin generating the highest return on tangible common equity in the banks history and returning asset quality to pre pandemic levels for the second quarter western alliance earned total net revenues of million net income before merger and restructuring charges of million and adjusted eps of an increase of from the prior quarter these results benefited from a million reversal of credit loss provision consistent with our excellent asset quality results strong balance sheet growth continued with loans rising billion excluding ppp loans or on a linked quarter annualized basis and deposits by billion or our deposit and loan pipelines are very active and total assets now stand at billion net interest income totaled million up million or for the quarter as robust balance sheet growth rising nim and western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 excess liquidity deployment significantly move the earnings needle strong loan growth led to a or billion increase in average loan balances quarteroverquarter additionally after closing the amerihome acquisition on april we added billion in heldforsale mortgages primarily gse qualified or of our average interestearning assets yielding approximately as an alternative to cash or mortgagebacked securities optimizing our interestearning asset mix helped nim expand from to in the second quarter fee income was a record million representing of total revenue as we began to integrate and optimize amerihomes mortgage banking related activities throughout the rest of western alliance mortgage banking related income was million in the second quarter demonstrating our ability to adjust win share as gain on sale margins fluctuate and maintain earnings i think its worth reemphasizing that what most attracted us to amerihomes business model was their low cost and flexible mortgage production and servicing ecosystem their leverages are complementary corresponded and consumer direct channels to feed and enhance value throughout western alliances commercial businesses while minimizing risk businesstobusiness correspondent mortgage lenders have several business levers and the flexibility to sustain earnings throughout the rate or throughout rate and economic cycles despite the evolving mortgage sector fundamentals amerihome continues to meet our expectations and contributed to eps in  we have optimized amerihomes balance sheet to western alliance capital levels with a servicing portfolio of billion in unpaid balances well yeah upb sorry expanded the number of correspondent sellers by to and taken advantage of market dislocations to drive value in the second quarter since april when the transaction closed amerihome generated billion in loan production or above levels for the full quarter period a year ago and only down from  with from traditional home purchases gain on sale margin was basis points for the quarter in line with 2019s basis points given the flexibility of amerihomes business model we continue to stand by our full year guidance of asset quality continued to improve this quarter as the economic recovery extended in breadth total classified assets declined million in  to basis points of total assets which is lower than  2020s levels on both a relative and absolute dollar amount just as the pandemic impact was beginning to be felt for the quarter net loan chargeoffs were zero finally western alliance is one of the most profitable banks in the industry with a return on average assets and a record return on average tangible common equity of and respectively which will continue to support capital accumulation to strong capital levels tangible book value per share modestly declined to from as goodwill and intangibles doubled to million in  mainly from recognizing the amh platform value at this time dale will take you through the financial performance dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks thank you ken for the quarter western alliance generated adjusted net income of million or million adjusted earnings per share up and from the prior quarter this is inclusive of a reversal credit provisions that ken mentioned of million and excludes pretax merger and restructuring expenses of million related to amerihome western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 additionally preprovision net revenue of million rose quarteroverquarter excluding those same charges after the amerihome acquisition total net revenue grew million during the quarter to million an increase of over from the prior quarter net interest income rose million during the quarter to million an increase of yearoveryear primarily a result of our significant balance sheet growth and deployment of liquidity into higher yielding assets average earning assets increased billion while lower yielding cash proportion held at the fed fell to from noninterest income increased million to million from the prior quarter and now represents of total revenue due to mortgage bankingrelated income of million from amerihome within this category net loan servicing revenue was in negative million as high refinance activity drove accelerated amortization of servicing rights but was far exceeded by gain on sale of mortgage loans preamerihome wal contributed noninterest income or million in the second quarter compared to million in the first supported by million of income from equity investments noninterest expense excluding merger and restructuring charges increased million mainly due to the acquisition of amerihome which increased compensation costs as we added approximately new members to the wal team as well as new costs related to loan servicing and origination expenses turning now to our net interest drivers you can begin to see the benefit of amerihome to our strategy to expedite and optimize the deployment of excess liquidity into higher yielding assets as we added billion in loans held for sale yielding as opposed to cash yielding basis points investment yields improved basis points from the prior quarter to while on a linked quarter basis loan yields excluding hfs declined basis points following ongoing mix shift towards residential loans and a slight reduction in noncommercial real estate loan returns interest bearing deposit costs were flat from the prior quarter at basis points the total cost of funds increased basis points to based on the due to the issuance of million of subordinated debt and the assumption of amerihome borrowings the spot rate for total deposits which includes noninterest bearing was basis points we expect funding costs have generally stabilized at these levels as a result net interest income grew million to million during the quarter or yearoveryear as average earning assets increased billion cash as a portion of average interest earning assets fell to from in the quarter which drove expansion by basis points to additionally excluding the impact of ppp loans the margin would have increased to basis points our efficiency ratio rose to from in the first quarter mainly driven by the addition of amerihome employees and increase in incentive compensation costs as mentioned on our first quarter call we expected the efficiency ratio to rise to the mid as a result of the acquisition preprovision net revenue increased million or from the prior quarter and from the same period last year this resulted in preprovision net revenue return on assets of for the quarter an increase of basis points compared to in the first quarter this continued strong performance and leading capital generation provides a significant flexibility to fund ongoing balance sheet growth capital management actions or meet credit demands balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans held for investment increased to billion or to billion and deposit growth of billion brought balances to billion at quarter end western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 in all total assets have grown yearoveryear as we approach the billion asset level borrowings increased billion over the prior quarter to billion primarily due to million subordinated debt issuance as well as the assumption of amerihome borrowings finally tangible book value per share decreased over the prior quarter to but increased year overyear again driven by the amerihome acquisition of intangible assets that were largely offset by  earnings and the issuance of common stock from our atm of for million despite heightened competition and pricing pressure we continue to generate consistent strong organic loan growth from our flexible national commercial business strategy loans held for investments grew billion in the quarter or billion excluding ppp payoffs of approximately million a majority of growth this quarter was driven by an increase in residential real estate loans of billion which now comprised of total loans as we look to deploy excess liquidity and integrated new flow arrangements from the recent galton and amerihome transactions this was supplemented by growth in capital call lines of million and construction and land loans of million turning to deposits we continue to see broadbased core deposit growth across business channels deposits grew billion or in the second quarter driven by increases in noninterest bearing dda of billion which now comprised of our deposit base and savings and money market deposits of million market share gains in mortgage warehouse continue to be significant drivers of deposit growth during the quarter along with strong performance from regional commercial clients robust fund raising activity in tech and innovation and seasonal inflows from the hoa banking relationships our asset quality continued to significantly improve this quarter total classified assets fell million in the second quarter to million to basis points of total assets while our total classified assets ratio declined basis points to basis points due to continued improvement in covid impacted clients finally special mention loans declined million during the quarter to of funded loans similarly quarterly net credit losses were negligible at for the quarter or zero basis points of average loans compared to a million net loss in the first quarter our loan allowance for credit losses fell million from the prior quarter to million due to continued improvement in credit trends and macroeconomic forecasts and loan growth in portfolio segments with low expected loss rates in all total loan acl to funded loans declined basis points to basis points or basis points when excluding ppp loans for comparison purposes the loan allowance for credit losses to funded loans was basis points at year end before cecl was adopted finally given our industry leading return on equity and assets we continue to generate significant capital to fund organic growth and maintain regulatory capital ratios our tangible common equity to total assets of and common equity tier ratio of were weighted down this quarter by the amerihome acquisition and strong asset growth however we issued  under our atm shelf during this quarter and completed a million credit linked note transaction that reduced risk weighted assets as we continue to look for ways to optimize our capital levels to support ongoing growth additionally we completed million in mortgage servicing rights dispositions and have already completed our expected  mortgage servicing sales capital levels should build from here inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment of per share our tangible book value per share declined for the quarter to compared to an increase of over the past months western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 ill now hand the call back to ken for closing comments kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks dale at the midpoint of the year i thought i would take this opportunity to reflect back upon our performance we deployed excess liquidity and turbo charged our net interest income yeartodate nonppp loans have grown billion and deposits have grown billion or times the amount of loan growth providing us an opportunity to deploy liquidity and growth and grow net interest income amerihomes past  guidance and is tracking to full year projections asset quality improved with substandard special mention and nonaccrual loans tracking downward with nearly no net chargeoffs for the quarter return on tangible common equity was for the quarter ppnr a key metric for the company earnings power was grew and we executed several capital raising transactions that dale just mentioned so for the second half of the year i think you can expect loan and deposits to continue to grow between billion and billion per quarter net interest income to grow quartertoquarter with incremental liquidity deployed into loans and investments to overcome the interest drag of the new subdebt and creditlinked note issuances nim will continue to see some pressure as competition interest rates and loan mix nudge loan yields downward ppnr will follow net interest income and fee income growth and will continue to rise throughout the year asset quality will remain steady although with net chargeoffs tracking to prior years performance or prior quarters performance we continue to believe we will exit the year at a eps run rate level and lastly we will deploy growth based capital strategy to support above trend balance sheet growth and finally i would be remiss in the outlook section of the presentation if i didnt predict the suns in at this time dale tim bruckner who is sitting to my left here our chief credit officer and i are happy to take your questions western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 question and answer section operator operator instructions for our first question we have brock vandervliet from ubs brock your line is open brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thank you hey ken does that billion loan guide include amerihome or is that got a standalone kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thats net loan growth for the company dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp we dont really expect loan growth from amerihome i mean amerihome it has their held for sale piece of that that can fluctuate some so i mean were talking about held for investment loans core loan growth thats the billion thats what the billion is attributable to brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it and shifting to amerihome i think the biggest question is just overall origination volume and gain on sale is this and obviously the parts of the sector are under pretty heavy pressure how do you look at things the remainder of the year for volumes and gain on sale margin kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so ill take half the question ill give the other half to dale first we dont see any change to the guidance that we gave which is of course we made for this quarter we do think there is some pressure in the marketplace on volumes and on margins as youve seen but brock you gave me an opportunity here to answer the question in a larger way and id like to frame it the way we think about it here for everyone on the call so im going to take advantage of your question with a minute answer here brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc great kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp first amh contributed only of our operating eps so its not the majority of our earnings of our company although today i assume its going to be the majority of the questions okay we believe that you shouldnt consider evaluate or compare amh to other standalone mortgage companies and for the following reasons one amh has many tributaries that feed into the banks net interest income and this is acquisition rationale that we had for making this purchase western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 so of course the held for investment mortgages which absorbed excess liquidity and help us generate constant loan growth thats one number two msr loans well be able to generate msr loans that will accompany msr sales in addition we expect custodial deposits not bundled along with msr sales that will help us fund in the future investments and loans again helping our net interest income grow we pay down the amh outstanding credit lines with our excess liquidity and once again that relates back to net interest income lower interest expense we are going to be able to mine we think our hoa book for consumer direct mortgage opportunities weve purchased ebo loans thats early buyout loans that produce a positive carry for us when we buy them but also produce a future gain on sale thats more equivalent to our consumer direct business ie a much larger gain on sale when we execute against this and then also amerihome has warehouse lending clients and we havent even begun yet to scratch the surface of crossselling into those warehouse lending clients which in turn once again back to net interest income will generate greater net interest income for us so because of the interconnectivity with the bank we kind of see amerihome as a provider of not only loan growth but really a provider of incremental net interest income for us and the acquisition of amerihome was designed to unlock and capture many of the revenue streams that are generally hidden inside of a mortgage company and i hope that kind of gives you a larger perspective on how we think about amerihome and how we think its going to help enhance our earnings going forward dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah brock i know we had a conversation during the quarter about seeing the volatility in this sector and what that might mean for us and we view amerihome as really a lowcost producer and thats an enviable place to be because that puts them in a position such that when there is a musical chairs game going on and i think there is in this space at this time they have the ability capacity to expand their win rate and their buy rate so they were doing in that number is about to today it could go higher still and so you saw this pivot its like okay well if the margins are under duress then we can make it up in volume and so the gain on sale number was higher than we thought it would be obviously in part mitigated by this acceleration of amortization that we had and the charge we ended up taking in the servicing revenue side so were confident that that gain can continue and again just echo kens comment i mean the real power to amerihome is not just what they can do on their own but how much better they make the bank perform because of this goto class to fill up our liquidity that we have brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc great color thank you ill jump back in the queue dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks operator for the next question we have casey haire from jefferies casey your line is open western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning everyone kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning casey haire q analyst jefferies llc dale just wanted to follow up on the amerihome side specifically that the mortgage servicing drag that you mentioned can you just think about give us a way to think about how that line should run going forward and what the msr impairment was in the quarter apologies if i missed that dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so i wouldnt im not going to really rephrase it as an impairment that took place i mean so these models are trying to predict human behavior theres a lot a lot of things that with the human behavior that arent necessarily picked up in these models and i think in particular what you had in the first quarter second quarter coming in is you had kind of very substantial volatility in the 10year so everyone thought oh gosh we missed the bottom of the rates and so that actually based on the models it should see a slowdown in prepayment behavior because rates are higher but no thats not what happened you have acceleration of prepayment behavior and to me my closest analogy is its like last call its like you know what its am you got to get in here otherwise youre going to miss out on the lowest rates in a generation but then what happened wow we saw the 10year get up to ph and now were back to in the ph range and so were getting now even an echo wave of that so these prepayment speeds have come in higher than we thought that resulted in accelerated amortization im not going to necessarily call these impairments but getting to your point a more normalized level we would be looking for about a million quarterly positive in that servicing line you cant just say oh gosh its under by million on a run rate basis though because of kind of the comment i just made in terms of the gain on sale number is better probably because the servicing revenue was impaired servicing revenue being impaired means theres a lot of refi business going on theres a lot more activity generating in the system and so the gos the gain on sale opportunity is a bit higher so its not kind of a one forone deal but yeah in a steady state wed look for about a plus million in that i mean its in the revenue its the contra revenue for a reason because its not supposed to be a contra casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay got you so i mean youre standing by the and so that implies basically this the amerihome contribution is running around in the back half of correct western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yes dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp correct casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay all right and then just on your comment dale if that capital will build from here what does that assume like if you guys beat continue to beat your loan growth guide will you just continue to use the atthemarket offering or how should we think about is that capital build line is that does that just assume that loans and deposits grow billion or you just use the atm to true it up dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp perhaps a little bit of both but i think the balance sheet growth number is going to be higher could be higher than billion and not even need to touch the atm because if you saw this last quarter we were overwhelmingly our loan growth was in residential i dont think its going to be that high proportionately to the other categories going forward but it will be preponderant and that is a asset class assignment and so based on that if you grow if it was just that you could grow billion to get to billion of risk weighted asset increases which would be the same so our earnings this year were million based on that that would support billion ph if it was all you can do the math on that so i think weve got more capacity with just capital generation that we have going on irrespective of atm which we could we will cap as needed but right now we dont think thats going to be significant casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great and just last one for me the borrowings that you assume from amerihome if im reading the margin tables right it appears there is about million left at period end is that correct dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp correct casey haire q analyst jefferies llc and so thats a lever that you also have to pull to help i mean im assuming you are going to continue to pay that down to zero dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah it is some of those a good chunk of those borrowings have high rates and are not coverable for an extended period of time so dont look for that to drop off to zero as much as wed like it to western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc understood thank you dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks operator for the next question we have brad milsaps from piper sandler brad your line is open brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp morning brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co dale just wanted to followup sort of around the loan growth guidance commentary last quarter you mentioned getting to a loan to deposit ratio maybe by the end of this year or early next i dont know if that contemplated another billion of deposit growth as you saw this quarter but just kind of curious how to think about that loan to deposit ratio number and maybe as that pertains to the held for sale loans those came in a bit higher than i was looking for and then is there incremental amerihome production that you plan to retain above and beyond the billion to billion loan growth guide dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so i mean a few things going on there so yeah i mean here we wanted to get to kind of 90ish or whatever and we actually faded back a little bit because of the deposit growth was so robust i dont have a timeline of exactly kind of when were going to get there i do believe that weve got quarters in front of us where loan growth is going to exceed deposit growth and thatll pull that up when i talk about loan to deposit ratio i do not include the held for sale loans i think held for sale is a much better comparison to the cash and investment portfolio those are the average life of those loans is only a few weeks and so it has a much more liquidity relative to those other categories away from loans so i do think that there i mean i like the held for sale portfolio because basically you get the note rate on those loans predominantly and yeah they flip every three weeks and so its a very sensitive asset at the same time but we will have to have a situation to do that were going to have loan growth and amerihome is going to be the primary conduit for this kind of well in excess of deposit growth right now deposit growth can just iterate it looks continues to look strong so im not exactly sure when thats going to be but we do have several things going on one is we have feeds from amerihome today that go on our balance sheet for higher yielding and origination activity as they have these are things like vacation homes theyre going western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 to be coming out this quarter with a jumbo product that they had years ago reintroducing that that can come up on our balance sheet too because its a higher yield low ltv great credit quality as well as nonqualified mortgages so were getting these from the galton relationships were getting these from our own warehouse clients and as ken said were going to start mining warehouse clients among the clients that amerihome has that they buy from and with that we can put in our own our own direct conduits to feed our appetite for high quality low ltv high yielding because theyre not ph putable to the gses resi mortgages brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co okay great thanks and then just switching gears a little bit maybe to the expense side of the equation what type of expense flexibility should we think about as the mortgage business sort of ebbs and flows over the next several quarters dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well we see i mean there can be some flexibility within this we think that the amerihome pivoted really well and the volatility that took place in the second quarter in terms of finding ways to increase gain on sale even though we had increased amortization were looking for that to continue were looking for the kind of the total contribution which we mentioned on the previous call in  in  plus that puts and thats the same run rate that we have for getting to the number that we had for so i think theres multiple channels to manage through that process with all the levers that can enumerate it and so im not too concerned about that were looking at kind of the total i think we are going to stay in the mid and i think thats pretty reasonable brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co okay great just final followup for me can you comment on the change in bond yields linked quarter you guys had some nice improvement there im just kind of curious are you kind of things you might be buying you saw some nice improvement there and just curious you could provide any color dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah maybe a couple of things one of them we do have in our bond portfolio low income housing bonds we think thats a growing sector likely to continue those yields are higher than certainly the average in our book and in the first quarter again volatility same issue comes out its a little bit of a different animal but we had increased amortization of premium on mbs bonds that we had purchased that slowed down in the second quarter and so we had a less of a debit to hold against that and so that helped to bond yields pickup brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great thank you guys operator for our next question we have brandon king from truist securities brandon your line is open western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 brandon king q analyst truist securities inc thank you hi so loan growth was once i mean deposit growth was once again strong this quarter could i get a break down of the verticals on a dollar basis where deposit growth came from kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp did you say deposit brandon king q analyst truist securities inc yes deposit growth kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp well warehouse lending grew about billion our new deposit verticals grew a little over million hoa business where the first quarter is very seasonally strong still had a good quarter this quarter grew million and technology which is awash in liquidity was up million so i would take a little exception that we didnt have a great quarter i mean billion dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp indiscernible kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp oh it did oh im sorry it came across take that back sorry came across a little fuzzy so thats how the billion but basically when you look at all the sectors it was pretty much broad based throughout our all our silos and all our regions brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thank you kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thank you brandon king q analyst truist securities inc and for mortgage warehouse obviously you continued to grow deposits there but it looks like the loan growth is soften there what is the outlook for warehouse balance sheet for the remainder of the year kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 so yeah i agree with you it was a little bit softer this quarter when we think about warehouse lending we have a couple other business lines to get wrapped in there our msr lending and our note financing should offset some of the weakness in warehouse lending overall or warehouse lending proper but we think going forward as we begin to rollout our crosssell activity which will be towards the end of the year to be quite honest we think well be able to gain or hold market share going forward brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and just lastly the reserve came down again in the pace of loan growth do you think we could have bottomed on an absolute dollar basis of the reserve going forward or do you see ph continuously down even though were still getting growth in those lower costs credit cost business lines dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i dont know i can call it bottom i mean i appreciate that we are going to hit the bottom on the reserve in dollars certainly sooner than we are going to hit the bottom on the ratio i mean negligible chargeoffs this past quarter throughout this recession and admittedly a very odd recession in terms of credit quality behavior primarily driven by federal intervention but that would point you that our reserve could still be very substantial we had basis points of losses the average remaining life on our loan book is years if you said well i can need only years for a duration on basis points thats a basis point reserve if that were to be the math obviously were not getting anywhere near to there but you could see how even on a dollar basis it could continue to ebb most significantly is that even compared to our balance sheet prececl is weve been growing in these categories that have had historically zero and prospectively low if not zero anticipated losses in low ltv residential loans capital call lines mortgage warehouse public finance and as that proportion is growing larger and larger that also tends to push the numbers lower i personally dont think that the outlook for the economy is going to improve in the near term is dramatically is the forecasted whether it was moodys whether it was blue chip in the second quarter so i dont know if were at the bottom or not but i do think that certainly the preponderance of the reserve releases are behind us brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks for all the answers dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks operator next we have chris mcgratty from kbw chris your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for the question maybe talking about the mortgage business a little bit differently dale the proportion that youre holding on your balance sheet around and i think we all agree thats a great trade western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 relative to buying a bond at these levels im interested in kind of where you see that taking away your comfort range is from that proportional piece of the loan book dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well so i mean i think i first want to address this from our interest rate risk profile so we have a very naturally asset sensitive balance sheet compared to most ci loans are a big piece of what weve got even some of the securities weve been purchasing have a variable rate element to them and then our funding structure dda very low in terms of cds and the administered rate categories like money market are client relationships and i think theyre going to have lower than kind of mean beta of what youd see so we start from a position that we can tolerate higher levels of residential weve been below the peer group for a long time which im going to paying at about now at it has moved up significantly obviously and i think were going to go to that number and kind of see where we are i think we see a lot of opportunity in front of us in terms of improving yield these are in low risk credit rates and with the deposit growth we can kind of do this and this can but i do think its not going to be as sharply climbing as it certainly did this last quarter we are seeing increased breadth in terms of credit demand we believe and so i think were going to see a little more balanced growth prospectively but yeah were going to be moving up to christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay its a great color in terms of the liquidity you guys i think were one of the more aggressive in deploying it with cash around to i mean whats the reasonable level that you need to run proportional to the balance sheet dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so as of right now we have billion in cash so weve got money to deploy today i dont think that number needs to be very large and in part i look to the held for sale portfolio to drive that that portfolio from amerihome the large preponderance in there as well has those clear out in two to three weeks and so that is a near cash element that we can use so im comfortable with kind of with where we are i think that number could drop down a bit more to to with liquidity behind it from loans that have already been pledged for delivery to the gses christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp chris i might also we might also mention we have an billion credit line with the federal home loan bank that is unused weve got a multibillion dollar credit line with the federal reserve that is unused weve got multibillion dollar credit lines credit funds lines with other institutions theyre not necessarily committed but we think that theyre certainly there that are also unused so weve got well over billion that we could drop on as needed western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great and then if i could just sneak in a housekeeping i think when you announced amerihome you talked about the tax rate maybe going up basis points so looking for a little guidance on there and then the card income was strong this quarter i want to understand if thats a run rate thanks dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so on the tax rate i think i am expecting that number to ebb up a little bit from where we are thats in i think its i could see it climbing closer to the card income there has been kind of a difference in activity ours is really ph a pcard i dont know that i would expect that to extrapolate from there but i think business levels are getting better christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you very much dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks operator for the next question we have timur braziler from wells fargo timur your line is open timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning maybe just circling back on the expense side i think you had said that the amerihome deal added employees to the organization i know you mentioned that the efficiency ratio is likely to be maintained in the mid or at least in the near term im just wondering as that business is fully integrated and run kind of the western alliance way is there an opportunity to optimize that business at some point or are the two different enough where you cant really touch the expense side of the amerihome kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp i think for the company overall you need to think about the efficiency ratio being just about where it is and thats where were going to probably run the company that will allow us to continue to invest in new products and services look to bring on new business teams maybe you look to develop organically new business silos and also as we continue to grow at the pace that were growing so were a billion assetbased company today we need to also ensure that we put the right investment into the technology and onto the risk management side of the business so when we think about our numbers when we think about the guidance leaving this year at a eps run rate we dont have it moving off of that allows us to grow eps earnings the way we think we need to grow and also invest at the same time western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful and then just one last one on amerihome originations and you said the win rate now is to up from i think historically previously you had mentioned that that number could go as high as and it doesnt really sound like the nonqm component is really ramping up yet so as that ramps up is that going to go through the production and increase kind of the gain on sale volume is more of that going to be portfolioed in the near term and then kind of corollary to that if you can just talk about where the resi yields that were put on the book today are and where those can go once you start bringing down some of the nonqm paper dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so i mean the primary goal of increasing or broadening what theyre buying is to give the bank another channel of growth in residential with again low ltv betteryielding assets so amerihome for the most part now has generated product that we like the business but wed like it going to the gses because the yields arent necessarily high enough for what we think the best kind of riskadjusted returns would be and so but as they add that in well be able to pick up even more from amerihome to kind of put on our balance sheet i think that number is going to be around what we can do kind of going forward kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp i mean this is what we get paid for there is a lot of interconnectivity between amerihome and on the banking side if we have strong loan demand on the banking side we will not hold on to as much on the residential mortgage side and amerihome will have a higher gain on sale if there is any soft demand or more excess liquidity than what we anticipated well take loans from amerihome and well keep them on our balance sheet and the gain on sale will be less for amerihome but youll see a higher flowing net interest income for the bank and so thats what we balance out every day here timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then so as you start bringing on more nonqm paper i guess how fast should we expect to see the win rates start to elevate i mean theyre going to stay at the level for now and the mix shift is not going to change or do you see the nonqm channel being additive to whats currently being produced kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so im hesitant to give you a forecast going forward what the win rate is because youve got to add a few other factors in there whats the margin whats happening with overall with the 10year but what ill say is and what we learned when we were doing the due diligence for amerihome is that they have the ability to expand the win rate in order to keep the gain on sale income high enough to achieve what we want to achieve in terms of our eps guidance and so thats going to be balanced between margin and between the win rate and as we said it was theyre at theyve been as high as about so weve got room there to move that around timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you for taking my questions western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thank you operator for the next question we have jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets jon your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thank you good morning everyone kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey ken one of your quotes in the release is you began to unlock value from amerihome im just curious whats next is it the things you referenced like mining the warehouse in hoa or is there something else thats more near term and right in front of us when you say youre just beginning to unlock value kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah thanks jon its really everything i mentioned as a little bit of a prelude on the earnings call here so weve got a list of things that were just going down and executing upon certainly the easiest one was lets unlock the value by paying down their outstanding credit lines done as were selling msrs lets see if we can give loan commitments to the buyers which weve done this quarter lets see if we can hold on to deposits which weve done this quarter but its not a one and done thing of course were going to continue to work on that as we go forward a little further down is the crosssell into the warehouse lending lines thats going to take a little bit longer as you can expect we were focused on legal day and legal day but the warehouse lending crosssell will happen towards the end of the year weve got the amerihome folks working on the jumbo mortgage program we have been working on the nonqm program so and those are just some of the things i can i reference so weve got a lot of things going on here what were trying to do is find the value that we can unlock at amerihome which translates over into our net interest income which just gives us greater value and in terms of valuation on the banking side and thats how weve always thought about the deal jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay any of the stuff new ph have you found more synergies or things that you think could be larger than you originally anticipated western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah actually the first place where we saw one of the bigger opportunities where we said oh my god we werent thinking about this it was on the ebo side thats the early buyout of loans from ginnie mae youre able to buy them at par and then turn around and sell them at very close to consumer direct margins spreads which is in that basis point range the reason why amerihome was active but not overly active was that they had a negative carry to that because their cost of funds was probably all in around libor basis points well we took basis point money and we put it against a large purchase of ebo loans and now were able to carry that the ebo loans in a positive carry until were ready to sell the loans down the road so i think that one really surprised us at how quickly that opportunity appeared and frankly it wasnt really discussed much during the due diligence period we were doing more of the normal blocking and tackling conversations during due diligence jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay two more questions here i understand why youre breaking out the profitability now but is this something you plan to do or you want to do in the future is breaking out the profitability or do we expect this to eventually be very much integrated in the consumer piece of the business kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah good question for this year were going to continue to kind of give you the guidance of the because its a new business line but we dont breakout any of the other business lines as i said jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc right kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp this is a of our total net income so as we start giving you the you can see were doing it now were giving you the guidance that were existing the year at thats the number were focused on for the whole company exiting at this year were talking to a little bit more about the because we want to make sure the comfort level is there that you know that were executing upon that acquisition upon that trade if you will but longer term were just going to talk about our total eps dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i mean the mortgage its integrated the more murky and difficult it is to try to distill it all i mean if were cross selling into their warehouse clients now and then were getting direct sales to our mortgage portfolio holdings what does amerihome get allocated for that were not into that game were more interested in moving the whole ball rather than trying to see who gets how many pieces in each side of the play western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah its interesting because you hit on a hotspot here for us as we were thinking about this not too long ago if we take more mortgages from amerihome and we keep it on the balance sheet of course weve just lowered amerihomes gain on sale so this is the murkiness that dale talks about is that good or bad well i kind of think its kind of good that were keeping it on our balance sheet were getting that net interest income and its going to stay out there for an extended period of time others could say well gee i would have liked that game to happen immediately because i want that immediate recognition so we try to balance this stuff and thats why we think its much better to look at the overall total eps number than it is just to look at a segment of the eps jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah thats good i was going to ask that but i thought it was too deep for this call but just in terms of the allocations but just one more for you dale not everyone that hold your stock as a mortgage expert and this is probably annoying and a simple question but how would you think about the main inputs into that that gain on loan origination and sale line that million just big picture what should we be thinking about when we model that line dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well so i mean amerihome has been a large producer in this space i think that that their activity level can continue at what theyve been running thats their core business we think thats certainly an opportunity we think they can expand that as weve talked about in terms of some of these other business lines we think there is maybe a crosssell into our hoa business and things like this but again thats going to get kind of overwhelmed by the benefit we get so i mean amerihomes numbers they had million of net interest income in the quarter from mostly hoping their held for sale loans the other million was core western alliance on net interest income and that was in part because of the liquidity deployment so i am looking for amerihome to continue to deliver as they have and but again these crosssells i think are really where the key is in terms of driving higher eps jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thanks for everything i think suns in you have to win at home but it has to be a little dramatic so thats my call kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp well we have like suns championship tshirts on order so were already heavily vested into that if not well be selling them very cheaply to anyone who wants some jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right thanks western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks operator for the next question we have gary tenner from da davidson gary your line is open gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning ph get away from mortgage for a second just want kind of ask about the creditlinked notes for a moment obviously as part of that transaction you freed up a good amount of riskbased capital and some extra capacity for lending i just wonder if you would draw a direct line to that capacity as it relates to the crosssell opportunities into amhs warehouse clients are increasing the warehouse business or would you think of it more holistically is this creating additional capacity for wherever those higher risk weighted assets come from dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i think its more holistic in terms of what that is i mean again were focused on generating strong risk adjusted returns the warehouse space is one that not just us but i think the industrys experience from a credit perspective has been very strong the creditlinked note does strengthen the does strengthen the credit quality of the bank and provides more insulation to it we have somebody whos now on a first loss position not us if there is any losses within that portfolio so we do get a relief on the on like you mentioned the risk weighted assets i think its warranted because somebody else away from us an investor has first loss for anything that happens there so in that sense were a stronger credit profile but what we look at is gosh now rwa is lower we can continue to grow from a shareholder perspective its much cheaper to do the creditlinked note than it is to issue shares on the atm thats obviously a substitute alternative to get there and it reinforces the value of that business line because we can have a direct method to support the capital needs from there that is significantly less expensive than the returns that we get from our clients gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thank you and then just to ask about the run rate that youve talked about the last couple of quarters exiting this year can you give us a sense of what that contemplates from a provision line item because obviously in a given quarter that could have some volatility to it so just any thoughts on what that contemplates or if you wanted to kind of equate that run rate to a ppnr per share kind of run rate as any additional detail dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well it includes a normalized provision it does not include releases or underfunding or nor does it include the reverse of another kind of global challenge like we had in so but what it does look like in terms of basis points i dont have a number for you but i think if you look at the composition of our loan growth and where it comes from what would it take to support that kind of going forward we dont perceive of substantial credit losses coming at any time in the future but wed cover chargeoffs so wed cover chargeoffs and wed cover growth in western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 a relatively low risk growth profile as were putting on the books in and i think were going to be looking at in kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah i would echo that i mean id look backwards and look what our last years chargeoffs were and maybe use that as a guide as what the provision would be but to be very clear we dont anticipate large releases to generate that eps run rate thats not included in our logic gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co all right thanks guys kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thank you operator for the next question we have david chiaverini from wedbush security sic wedbush securities david your line is open david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks i had a followup on deposits you mentioned about how the mortgage warehouse deposits were up very strongly at billion i was curious is there any seasonality in the mortgage warehouse deposits that could be a headwind as we look out to the third quarter and fourth quarter dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp there is some seasonality im going to say fourth quarter and maybe primarily driven by california california taxes property taxes are due and so as you know those warehouse deposits are overwhelmingly funds held from escrow funds from servicers so which people escrow their insurance payments and they escrow their tax payments but as you get one particular state that is skews heavily for their overall i think they are due in november im not a california resident so youre going to see a dip whereby the servicer is writing a check drawn on us to the state or to the relevant counties they are coming in so yeah there is a piece with that david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks for that and then shifting to the resi mortgage portfolio that youre keeping just want to clarify that what you are keeping historically and continues to be jumbo and nonqm dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah it does i mean so again the trade that were making is were willing to give up liquidity for yield and strong asset quality so were going to compromise in any q but if we can get if we can give up some liquidity to get a better return well do that so what i mean by that is say you have a nonqualified mortgage something that isnt western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 16jul2021 salable to the gses its going to trade at a lower price a higher yield something that is jumbo is going to trade at a lower price higher yield so we have these are about loan to value loans debt to income is in the mid the fico scores are so we think its pretty good quality stuff but because its not saleable it trades at a lower price and were like oh gosh we can how handle that we want to put it on our balance sheet kind of going forward just because its not liquid to the gses it doesnt mean its not liquid to us so for example all of these loans we can pledge on our federal home loan bank line and they give us advances on them and it wouldnt be difficult at all even if you wanted to securitize these loans and sell them to private investors david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc great thanks very much dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks operator we dont have any further questions kenneth a vecchione president chief executive
