director western alliance bancorp thank you miles i would like to start by thanking our clients for the trust they placed in western alliance and to the people of western alliance for their extraordinary efforts over the last month since the collapse of three competitor banks in midmarch our team has worked relentlessly to meet our clients banking needs flexibility of our diversified national commercial banking strategy with a broad range of valueadded deposit channels and deep commercial customer relationships in a wide variety of sectors and geographies all contributed to our firms resilience in the face of recent turbulence in the banking industry we believe our focus on sound financial fundamentals stable asset quality and rebuilding capital and liquidity levels over the past several quarters have all helped us navigate through this challenging time as we move forward with a renewed perspective we are well positioned to expand our client relationships and continue to achieve strong return profile balance sheet repositioning which included surgical sales of assets and loan reclassifications resulted in after tax net nonoperating charges of million but will have an immediate accretive impact to regulatory capital and allow us to prioritize core client relationships with holistic lending deposit and treasury management needs the company earned through these charges and achieved net income of million and earnings per share of for the quarter increasing tangible book value per share to from yearend with a cet ratio of western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 immediately after the exogenous events of midmarch wal experienced elevated net deposit outflows that soon returned to normalized levels outflows were concentrated on few key client groups that will form our funding strategy going forward suffering from the taint of svbs failure approximately billion or of our technology and innovation deposits were withdrawn less than anticipated given that also had lending relationships our mortgage warehouse business remains fairly stable on a net basis with only the loss of a single customer that we expect to return to western alliance with more stable deposits although settlement services experienced some initial volatility from very recently acquired clients flows normalized quickly balances were stable quarter overquarter our regional divisions strong local brands and small to midsize metro business relationships acted as a core source of strength and saw only modest deposit attrition noncore regions which included title companies and other fiduciaries reacted more reflexively stock market volatility and withdrew approximately billion these are nondeposit channels that we are prioritizing going forward since march our deposit flow stabilized and returned to a healthy growth trajectory with deposits up billion to billion as of april some business lines were never impacted including hoa with deposits higher by million since the beginning of the year to april our flexible diversified business model proved its worth in  while monoline banking models dependent on single industries or concentrated customer types failed of our customers already have more than one product or service with us and we will continue to prioritize client segments with fulsome banking service needs that include credit and treasury management while deemphasizing creditonly relationships overall wal successfully retained deep rooted relationships and those for which we offer proprietary integrated treasury management technology solutions like hoa and well continue to do more of these it is also worth mentioning that not a single deposit channel of ours represented greater than of total deposits at the onset of the deposit crisis we responded to our clients desire for the market scrutiny surrounding enhanced deposit protection since yearend we have taken concrete steps to dramatically grow our insured deposits from approximately of total deposits to as of april this places wal on the top decile among the largest us banks also as of april uninsured deposit coverage now stands at this resulted from the shift towards insured deposits to accommodate depositors desires to have their funds safe and protected we will continue to provide clients of deposit alternatives that accentuate safety in these uneasy times i think its important to offer some thoughts on the volatility experienced in our industry since midmarch while navigating through new developments through strategies initiated in and initially described in our  and  earnings calls such as deemphasizing loan growth in advance of an economic slowdown or in deposits and liquidity faster than loan growth and achieving a greater than cet1 ratio informed by lessons learned and the recent stress of the banking system we have moved up our mediumterm cet1 goal to and we are targeting a mid loantodeposit ratio at the onset of this tumult we acted decisively to tap various sources to enhance our liquidity position engaged with stakeholders through measured but impactful financial updates and maintain normal business operations looking forward we will remain focused on building additional liquidity and capital while reaffirming our deposit led growth strategy driving increased diversification and additional deposit streams are also our top strategic western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 goals to ensure adequate liquidity over the medium term we will aim to drive our loantodeposit ratio to the mid by cultivating deeper client relationships we look to organically and expeditiously rebuild capital greater than before the end of the second quarter our mediumterm cet1 target is emulating larger banks that typically have larger capital cushions will be an important step to drive sustained core deposit growth and the regulatory environment will likely become stricter in response to recent industry turmoil higher capital higher liquidity and lower dependence on moderate rate funding should attract more core deposits and hopefully higher investmentgrade ratings accelerating hqla growth in securities book is also something that we plan to do bolster liquidity and capital we chose to reposition our balance sheet through very targeted reclassification of certain loans and assets from heldforinvestment to heldforsale and specific noncore asset sales we reclassified approximately billion of hfi loans recognizing an approximately fair value adjustment of million after tax that includes expected future pl and capital impacts after tax charge will be immediately accretive to regulatory capital as the loans are liquidated and allows us to devote efforts to pull client relationships with lending deposit and treasury management needs weve already made significant progress in executing this strategy with actions that add basis points to cet1  million of loan sales were executed in fourth quarterend with another billion already under contract but not closed by msr sales of million select security sales of million and the unwind of high cost mortgage warehouse equity fund resource clns all contributed to help offset the hfi reclassification onetime charge in addition we are moving expeditiously to execute the remaining billion of hfs loan sales loan sales realized more losses than we expected note the ones that are on the remaining hfs loans are incorporated into our  numbers these actions reaffirmed our plans to surpass cet1 capital by june even with the marktomarket adjustments from balance sheet repositioning we still advanced our cet1 ratio basis points to when considering the contracted loan sales for this month and the unwind of our efr cln capital call and subscription lines weve already locked in cet1 ratio above before considering our organic capital generation or completing sales of the remainder of the hfs loans which will ultimately push cet1 above finally western alliance has significantly access to more than billion in contingent sources of liquidity to meet the customer and operating needs access to onbalance sheet cash and unused borrowing capacity increases to greater than billion with the nearterm completion of hfs asset sales billion of which are contractually agreed to and will be used to pay down higher cost btfp and fhlb shortterm borrowings and return to a more normal sources of financing we continue to evaluate additional opportunities to establish secured borrowing facilities from other sources at this time ill let dale take you through the financial results dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks ken turning to the first quarter results western alliance earned total adjusted net revenue of million excluding nonoperating charges net income was million while adjusted net income was million earnings per share was with an adjusted eps of quarterly loans decreased billion as billion was transferred to hfs matching the deposit decline of billion western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 total adverselygraded assets increased million and quarterly net chargeoffs was million or basis points annualized operating return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity of and provide sustainable goforward earnings in the quarter western alliance generated preprovision net revenue of million total adjusted net revenue of million was an increase of yearoveryear and an increase of million fourth quarter net interest income decreased during the quarter to million average earning assets increased billion while lower yielding cash grew and of interestearning assets creating a drag on the new gaap noninterest income decreased million to a negative million while adjusted noninterest income grew million from the prior quarter mortgage banking revenue increased million quarterly to million as amerihome continues to see green shoots in this operating environment production margins have widened to more historically normalized levels of basis points as the industry capacity has been rationalized retreat of a large money center bank from the correspondent lending market has paved the way for higher margins and win rates the servicing rights assets continue to produce attractive returns given the lower prepayment fees and strong underlying asset quality and continued to attract interest from investors  sale of million of msrs at par provide flexibility and a long glide path before we come to the market again loans held for investment decreased billion to billion and deposits decreased billion indiscernible to billion at quarterend msr balances decreased million in the quarter to million total borrowings increased billion over the prior quarter to million due to an increase in shortterm borrowings of billion partially offset by redemptions of creditlinked notes million finally tangible book value per share increased or over the prior quarter to and up nearly over the prior year turning now to the decomposition of our quarterly goforward and goforward net interest drivers our investment securities portfolio grew approximately million to billion as we sold million of securities predominantly credit clos other investments increased approximately million which primarily consists of highquality liquid assets such as treasury bills part of our strategy to further enhance our liquidity position investment yields increased basis points from the third quarter to with an endofquarter spot rate of given the uncertain economic environment we curtailed loan growth early in the first quarter this slowdown in credit accelerated in march as we rightsized existing loan balances through reclassification through heldforsale and targeted loan sales of approximately billion primarily from limited credit relationship credits or with limited credit spreads these actions lowered our periodend balance to billion loan yields continue to benefit from repricing into the higher rate environment and wider overall spreads with an endofquarter spot rate of compared to an average rate of our residential loan portfolio of billion is match funded with noninterestbearing deposits of billion turning to a decomposition of our heldforinvestment loan reclassification loans transferred to hfs nearly half were syndicated credits in capital call and subscription lines areas we had previously mentioned we would be deemphasizing billion loans heldforsale portfolio had a quarterend spot yield of which are now funded by fhlb borrowings with a current spot cost of resulting in a modest margin completing the sales transaction lend support and buoyancy to our net interest margin guide total cost of deposits spot rates increased basis points to at quarter end compared to an average of this was primarily driven by a billion increase in cds that now comprise of deposits while non western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 interest bearing ddas comprise of our total deposit mix of which have no cash payment of earnings credits notably the spot rate for interest bearing dda is lower than the average for the quarter as migration from non interest bearing checking is accomplished at lower rates than the average interest checking rate but savings and money market rates were also lower at also were lower as balance attrition tended to be from larger and higher cost accounts cost of interest bearing deposits increased basis points for the quarter to compared to the ending spot rate of billion decline in deposits during the quarter was roughly evenly split between money market accounts and demand deposits overall net interest income decreased million or over the prior quarter nearly half due to two fewer days in the quarter and the remainder due to balance sheet repositioning actions in light of the deposit loss held for sale loans contributed million which will decline as we liquidated these assets net interest margin compression compressed basis points to due to increased borrowings short term excess cash on the balance sheet we had to ensure liquidity and an incremental drag of basis points going forward we estimate that our balance sheet is fairly interest rate neutral with rate shock sensitivity either up or down only changing net interest income by less than our adjusted efficiency ratio increased to from in the quarter and was flat yearoveryear higher deposit cost of million related to higher earnings credit rates and normal  seasonality were the primary drivers of the increase from the fourth quarter preprovision net revenue was million during the quarter a increase from the same period last year and a decrease of million or from the prior quarter this resulted in ppnr return on assets of for the quarter a decrease of basis points from  the aggregate of adversely graded credits increased million this quarter we see nothing significant in this modest migration to indicate a more widespread deterioration is looming total nonperforming assets increased million basis points of total assets ph really net loan chargeoffs was million or basis points of average loans with the net loan chargeoffs of million or basis points in the fourth quarter our total loan acl decreased million from the prior quarter to million as loans were marked down and the acl released as these credits were transferred to held for sale loan acl to funded loans increased to basis points compared to basis points in  as some of the loans transferred had low loss rate assumptions including capital call and subscription lines and mortgage warehouse credits additionally the reserve associated with commercial real estate will increase as the economic outlook softens tangible common equity to total assets of and common equity tier ratio of were both bolstered by net income like the increase we expect for cet1 in the second quarter the tangible common equity ratio should rise in tandem inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment of per share our tangible book value per share increased to in the quarter to tangible book value per share continued its long ascent as the earnings power of the company surpassed charges associated with the banks balance sheet repositioning tbv also benefited from a reduced aoci impact after crimping book value last year as bond prices fell when rates rose western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 now ill turn the call back to ken kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay thanks dale our guidance for the rest of continues to be driven by the strategies and priorities laid out in our  and  earnings calls and informed by the recent banking disruptions in order to best serve our sophisticated commercial clients we will continue to aim to be more aligned with the countrys largest banks by rebuilding our capital levels enhancing insured deposits and liquidity lowering our loantodeposit ratio and deepening our client relationships we want to be seen as equal to these banks these peer banks from our depositors perspective eliminating these differences allows us to compete more on service performance and what i call management intimacy our csuite relationships can drive deeper banking relationships organic earnings balance sheet repositioning well continue to grow capital as we reposition the company for slower growth ahead of a potential economic slowdown so let me tell you what this means going forward regarding capital we discussed our imminent lift in cet1 to and that we expect to exceed by the end of  through planned loan hfs sales and organic capital growth over the medium term we will target an cet1 ratio which will be driven by our continued strong return on average tangible common equity and capital generation as we complete our planned hfs loan sales we will pay off shortterm borrowings and return to more traditional bank funding deposits are expected to grow at approximately billion a quarter and exceed more muted loan growth this will lower our loantodeposit ratio over time towards a mid80 target net interest margin is expected to slightly compress in to to given the anticipated flat rate environment slower loan growth and increasing price competition for deposits as our liquidity grows we will look to accelerate ph hqi growth in our securities book to further enhance liquidity flexibility our efficiency ratio excluding the impact of deposit cost should increase slightly to the mid to high given our smaller loan book but partially offset by the inherent operating leverage of our business asset quality remains wellpositioned and steady as she goes and then on future economic environment net chargeoffs could begin to normalize and we expect net chargeoffs to range between the first quarters basis points maybe up to basis points overall we expect ppnr for the full year of to be down to from levels through small interest earning assets and higher borrowing costs however as we execute our balance sheet repositioning efforts and continue to reestablish our core deposit growth trajectory we see western alliance as even a better institution and better wellpositioned for the future at this time dale tim and i are happy to take your questions western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions the first question today comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan steven please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everyone i wanted to start with a big picture question first so just following up on the balance sheet repositioning in the quarter a fair portion of your growth over the past few years has come from these noncore segments right which youre now exiting with you shrinking the company down to focus more on core relationships one when do you get there right when is the bank primarily done in terms of shrinking down to get to these more fuller relationships and then even more important what does western alliance look like after that do you focus on roe profitability are you still a growth bank what is western alliance kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay a couple of things there let me unpack them all one the efr loans that we have exited and some syndication lines that we exited again those were all noncore and they reflected our excess liquidity that we had in the company and lets go back to the days of when we had billion to billion of cash sitting at the fed earning basis points it was a good alternative to increase net interest income and it was excellent asset quality and thats what we did there were not as we continue to reemerge from this first things first i want to say our focus near term is on moving that deposit ratio down and also moving the capital levels up and were going to do that with a heavy focus and concentration on deposit growth and again a more muted growth in loans about 500plus million dollars as we emerge from  and position ourselves for we should be just about ready as we enter into to hit our cet1 ratios and hit our liquidity loan to deposit ratios now weve got plenty of opportunity here to grow i think youll see us go to some of our core strengths that have always been with us that have always helped us grow in the past ci loans out of warehouse lending is still active now part of this is going to be economically driven as well note financing is going to be there weve been strong in cre especially in lot banking weve always had good performance out of our hotel book again i want to say very clearly its all dependent upon where the economy is at the end of moving into but in the big picture we will go back to some of the things that weve done well but also during the course of the remainder of this year we have a number of different business lines that we are working on to developing some of those are on the deposit side and some of them are on the loan side and as weve done every year year and a half weve rolled out new business lines and opportunities to make sure we propel growth but i will say steve in the past weve been if you go back and look from backwards to youve seen weve grown loans and deposits on average both about to per year right we never got paid for that and i think what were going to do is were going to be a little more cautious on that loan growth but again accelerating on the deposit side so one we never have to experience a disruption with some information that was put in the marketplace which i think was inappropriate but we can get to that point in another time but i think were going to be a very steady grower i think we should be able to grow above peer trend like weve western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 always have i just dont think were going to grow at the very top end of peer trend i dont think thats necessary for us dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i might add that were really taking a surgical strike here on these types of things so capital call for example i mean we got into that as ken said when we had a lot of liquidity those are thinly priced deals and we did syndications where we received no deposits were not exiting that space entirely were still going to do bilateral deals with complete relationship and thats a way that we can kind of continue to be here but really step away from the stuff that really the marginal cost and marginal benefit from that is fairly muted steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it thats helpful thank you and maybe just one followup so if i look at the deposit decline in the quarter right the billion youre calling out through march the tech and innovation segment we heard from many other regional banks at this point that they were beneficiaries of the flight out of silicon valley bank what did you hear from your customers through this period which drove them to take deposits out of your bank i would have thought you could have been a beneficiary also but theyre just watching your stock price and panicking what was it and did they close accounts or they just bring balances down to the insured level thanks kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay one they didnt close accounts they moved deposits out so lets kind of break down the deposit outflow billion of the deposit outflow came out of our tech innovation and life science area and bridge bank which is our technology and innovation arm of the company was always set up as a challenger to svb so during the panic of monday morning the 13th i think people looked and said what most looks like svb well here is western alliance now what was interesting only of our deposits and about of our total loans was in the tech and innovation sector right but still there was a lot of pressure put on our stock price and what you saw was a modern day bank run right you saw heavy social media and commentary on social media which got shareholders nervous which drove the stock price down we can talk about this little later too which then forced some of the larger corporates that we had to through treasury management systems to move their mouse click point click and send the funds out then we received a phone call that said gee im sorry im moving my money but i see the stock price going down and better to be safe than sorry of our dollars that went out went out to larger banks the money center banks and everyone all said the same thing when the crises is over were going to come back and well wait and see if that happens well wait and see if they come back dollar for dollar i doubt it but they should come back because we havent lost touch with these folks all right on the second part of your question as it relates to tech and innovation we were still fighting the fight hold on to deposits during the on the 13th and the 14th of march now that has begun to change a little bit and we are more optimistic that deposit growth will begin to happen in our tech and innovation and that kind of informs us to say why we feel comfortable with growing billion per quarter western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay i appreciate it go ahead dale dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp in terms of kind of the stock situation steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so really i think the question starts with how did we get caught up in this and we think the regional tie is because because of bridge and the relationship that we have with the prime competitor to silicon valley bank but for us it was only of our total versus for silicon valley bank its basically their entire business but so what happened is is that issue when the run started on svb i think they looked around well who else is in the space and that perception quickly metastasized into a short narrative and if you looked at our options activity weve written a lot of days we wouldnt trade options at all but on that friday march we traded about a times our normal volume and the most common issue was somebody bought puts mind you this is what our stock is trading at so theyre out of the money and they expired next week the march in a week to me thats somebody that had an agenda and then on monday morning before the market opens at am new york time they were in the premarket session selling and nobody trades premarket so its pretty easy to move the stock price around and push it down down down and so we opened at on monday morning well thats what the print was and so when depositors saw that they go oh my gosh youre down over the weekend has that triggered an billion withdrawal on that monday now we traded down into the sevens and then nearly quadrupled and closed at per share thats not typical bank trading in terms of what goes on but i think the stock price recovery calmed down depositors and so we had a sharp drop about in terms of withdrawals on tuesday and then since then has been basically flat and after that entire week weve been on this kind of uptrend again steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it i appreciate all the color operator the next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you i guess maybe forwardlooking thinking about just your deposit growth outlook given sort of the new perspective talk to us around where deposit where you expect deposit growth to come from in terms of western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 business segments and whats and how are you thinking about just the incremental of the deposit cost thats coming into the bank yeah if we can start that kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay ill split this up ill take the first half ill give dale the second half in terms of deposit growth we see deposit growth coming from our hoa segment which was unaffected and one of the lessons learned here by the way when you take our technology use apis to connect the management companys technology and then they connect to the hoas back office or technology those accounts and dollars cant move thats a nine month to a year conversion and so one of the things that has informed us and what were looking at is where else can we find channels to do just that and be very deeply rooted into the back offices of our clients but hoa is one place where we expect growth our new business lines ill take you back to and early building settlement services building escrow services well we just launched corporate trust all those should contribute during the course of the year and then we also have the natural build warehouse lending group and the regions have very strong brand recognition actually stronger than i would have thought and so during the outflow we only saw to in that range for the regional bank branch torrey pines bank of nevada alliance bank of arizona first independent bank and bridge bank on the nontech side and so were going to make also a deeper commitment and a concerted effort to bring in more of that metro banking there because that for us is like our consumer deposits okay were not a consumer shop but those deposits are very sticky and to combine your question with steves question from before one of the things that weve learned this is really interesting if someone called us up and said during the crisis of monday and tuesday and really it was just monday and tuesday mostly monday to be honest with you right and said whats going on if we had that conversation that was a conversation that nine out of ten times we can hold on to the client but if you are a larger corporate and you moved your money really quick it is hard to rationalize a person out of a position that they did not rationalize themselves into so if you made a decision out of fear its hard to get to that person well our metro banking clients and depositors thats a conversation that they know dale gibbons who calls on them every couple of weeks they trusted that all right and thats a way to grow additionally i think one of the things we also learned is more information in terms of times of trouble really is very helpful the 8ks that we put out were certainly important for the markets but really it was done so that our business development officers could talk very specifically to our clients and give them very specific data the more specific the data the more concrete and finite the better they felt if you said gee weve been here for years and we believe in customer service and all that great but they needed to see things like what is your loan sorry what is your insured to uninsured how much coverage do you have when you have that data put into the marketplace and then the bdos can then take it and talk to clients that was very helpful so i went a little further than just your question there ill let dale take on the cost side here on this dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah yeah ebrahim yeah regarding the cost as we talked last year were not playing the baby game we were trying to say that were doing better than others perhaps because our beta is lower in terms of how fast were western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 raising our funding cost we were there where the market was when the price was all along and we know what that is and so today thats kind of where we are as well i dont think many banks can really pull in much in deposits as something meaningfully different than effective fed funds and so thats what weve dialed in in terms of what we can do but we do have these a variety of initiatives as well as our current array of deposit gathering divisions whereby we can continue to execute on that and i think thats demonstrated by what weve done for the past three weeks ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and maybe dale i guess a different way indiscernible outlook how do you think about if the fed is done with the rate hikes say in the next quarter and rates remain flat from there where do you expect the margin to exit dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i mean its really kind of where that is where that guide is as i mentioned the volatility we have around our margin our net interest income in different rate environments is almost nil less than whether up or down shock or ramp so thats intact i mean in terms of what we go from this to this guide of just a little bit lower than that i think its important to remember that has a couple of things in it that are depressing that number one is it has a very large cash position that we had for three weeks of march basically whereby we took down large dollars from the fhlb or the frb and we had it in cash i mean our balance sheet was close to billion on some of those days and we ended the quarter at billion that was at an upside down spread that costs our margin by basis points in addition we talk about the hfs loans that are coming out of here that have a spread of if you take that out of our margin at our margin rises about basis points so the is already depressed and so going holding that level or declining slightly i think that maybe helps with the modeling ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood ill requeue thank you operator our next question comes from casey haire with jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning guys wanted to touch on the borrowing pay down by my math you guys if you guys continue to grow loans deposits at million billion respectively you get to that mid by the end by summer can we expect the borrowings to be the use of the excess liquidity as you get there ratably and to what level dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 yeah i mean i think your borrowings are going to come down obviously to a level i dont have a dollar figure for you casey but yeah well take them down i mean we operated last year with a borrowing position in kind of the midsingledigits could be lower than that but we still expect to be using the fhlb and they also are a good accordion basically for daytoday liquidity as people withdraw or deposits come in and things like this and so thats a pretty stable source to do something like that what we dont want to do is we dont want to rely on the fhlb for just standard operating liquidity kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp i think your numbers are about right we could maybe get to that loantodeposit ratio a little bit sooner thatll be informed by our deposit activity right so if we do a better job itll come down quicker but i think your number your direction is about right casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great and on the efficiency ratio guide i got that just obviously theres a lot going on in the near term or in the last month just wondering if you could give an expense run rate for the second quarter this is a starting point kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so what id rather say is yeah i think what id rather say is the guide is in the mid to high and the expense run rate for us or the efficiency ratio ive said this on many calls is really the exhaust fumes that comes out from the business so we know where we want to get to in terms of eps and you can kind of back into certain things we wont sacrifice were not going to sacrifice the build that weve been doing in risk management programs in technology and technology itself and by the by it was because we put so much money into our technology our payment systems all work really well we had no fails so were very pleased with that and also the reason why were able to have some confidence around going the go forward into deposit growth is from new businesses that we have cultivated since and specifically on the deposit side so those things are going to continue if we dont put money into the company to grow and youre not going to have sustainable deposits and sustainable loan growth so i didnt give you a very specific answer to  but im just telling you mid to high is what were going to do inside of the overall outlook that i presented casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you and just last one for me if i take the spot rates that you guys provide in the slide deck and then give you credit for all of the hfs sales and layer in that high efficiency ratio i get above roa and an tangible roe does that sound about right dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp roa is it for the full for the year you mean casey haire q analyst jefferies llc western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 yeah well yeah like a run rate of with all the spot rates that you guys give and then giving credit to the balance sheet restructuring the billion fully offloaded dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah yeah so maybe youre a little bit off and i think its because you are jumping to the efficiency ratio instantly and you said high casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah exactly dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i dont know what high means but i mean yeah so remember were still going to have a lot of these billion thats already contracted thats coming in this quarter in terms of disposition some more will probably as well but thats going to linger a little bit and so that would is a revenue source that really doesnt have an expense tied with it so you may be a little bit you may be jumping up too quickly casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay understood thank you operator the next question comes from brad milsaps with piper sandler please go ahead brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey thanks for taking my questions kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co dale just wanted to hey hey ken just wanted to follow up on the spot rate discussion i was encouraged to see those lower on the deposit rates at the end of the quarter do you think thats sort of a onetime phenomenon and would you expect those to sort of accelerate again i think you mentioned you thought your deposit growth would mostly come from higher cost sources but just wanted to get a sense of sort of squaring those spot rates versus kind of whats going on in the environment with your deposit growth goals dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well so i mean yeah i mean i do think that we have two sources of deposit growth here one of them is at a more marginal cost and thats going to be kind of new money i believe and the other is recovery of funds from western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 clients that pulled funds out in kind of the last three weeks of march and i think that were going to have success on both of those categories in terms of where the lower cost money went or came from it really was predominantly in the tech space weve talked to getting better prices and a lot of them say theyre going to come back they just want to see a little bit of calmness and stability and reenter the space and so i think were on track with that so i think thats a portion of what youre going to see brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co okay and do you have a sense for maybe ecr deposit growth i mean those were basically flat linked quarter what percentage would that be of kind of how youre thinking about growth throughout the year dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i think ecr deposit growth is going to climb as well a lot of that comes from different elements of our hoa division as well as our mortgage warehouse operation and escrow funds related to principal and interest and title and taxes and insurance those have ecrs with them and i think were optimistic about how that can go this year too brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just a followup on the loan spot rates that you disclosed on slide you gave the average of but i assume that includes the loans that you moved to heldforsale at the end of the quarter with the spot of is that i assume that would exclude those loans held for sale so it would be up fairly materially over the average if i were able to back out those loans that you moved is that the right way to think about it dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp it is the right way to think about it yeah and weve kind of ill say reverse engineered it on page where we took the spot yields for the entire quarter and what that was in that spread and hence coming up with million is the revenue piece associated with the hfs disposition brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co got it and then finally for me the bucket that you term as i guess the billion of noncontracted plans sales is there anything that in your mind that would hold that up or maybe why that isnt i mean i know you guys have been extremely busy why that isnt under contract yet and then just appetite for further unwinding of any additional creditlinked notes that you might have out there kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so i think its important to say that weve got of that already cemented and were just waiting to close towards the end of april the other billion were in active conversations with and so we dont see any reason why were not going to get it done by the end of  i mean could something drag into a little bit into  maybe but right now were encouraged with the conversations were having with the parties across the table from us western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co okay great anything else on cln unwinding any or you think youre kind of done in that regard kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp no well there will be some more clns that unwind as we as part of the billion that were looking to sell and thats all factored into our net cet1 side that we have of course you lose capital efficiency when you unwind them but youre getting rid of the assets on the other side netnet these transactions are all capital accretive to us dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah the capital call and subscription cln which is the one were talking about is already contracted its being unwind daily were taking theyre taking loans out of that every day and so its just whittling down i think its going to be over by the end of this month and so that will be gone in terms of the other clns we have we have we still have three that are all residential we dont have plans to unwind or dismantle those brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co okay great thank you guys operator our next question comes from timur braziler with wells fargo please go ahead timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning looking at the hqla build in the quarter can you tell us where we are in that process maybe provide like hqla to total assets and as you continue to build that out is that additive to the current securities balances or is there going to be some additional repositioning that kind of keeps the securities book flat while hqla grows dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so yeah i mean were going to be taking that up i dont have a limit for you i mean theres demands associated with hqla as you surpass billion so were going to be on a trajectory to kind of have that rise and so over time i think it could displace something else in the afs book or whatever that we have presently but i wouldnt look for that to be thats not going to be some substantial kind of step set variable that youve got to leg into its going to be something that as our loantodeposit ratio descends were going to be climbing that ratio but were not going to its not going to jump in any substantial way thats going to i dont know disturb margin or things like this kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah i would say thats going to be informed by our insuredtouninsured level thats number one and again back to lessons learned if some large corporates bring back their money then we need to assign a higher level of western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 volatility to those dollars and then hold some of those dollars in hqla so that also will be part of the composition mix fabric of the new deposits coming in that were going to have to determine timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then construction loans continued to grow at a nice clip curious if you can provide what the current unfunded balances are in that book and what the funding schedule looks like there for the rest of the year timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer chief banking officerregional banking western alliance bancorp sure tim bruckner here hi timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay tim timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer chief banking officerregional banking western alliance bancorp okay yeah right and the funding schedule for the rest of the year rolls out at about million a quarter so within our funded loan balances and for our projections thats accounted for in the volume that represents the trajectory of the unfunded for this year timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then one last one for me and maybe going back to steves question on the bigger picture front here where do you ultimately see western alliance falling into the broader technology innovation sector once that recovers assuming theres going to be quite a lot of dislocation from silicon valley clients and do you ultimately see western alliance playing a larger role in that sector kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp i think its going to be a sector thats going to be positioned against the other growth areas that we have so its not going to be its not going to overwhelm the deposit composition or the loan composition thats something weve seen so were not going to be the new tech bank but i do feel very strongly that the others that are picking up the tech people out of svb and there have been a number of banks i think people are going to migrate to us and stay with us because one consistent performance is very important here not only consistency of the people that you deal with but consistency of the creditgranting process and the credit review and weve seen over our time here banks that have jumped into tech and innovation and they think its ci lending tim bruckner can pick up on this in a second if youd like but it is not and weve seen people jump in and say hey im here to provide you credit and all of a sudden they see wait a minute youre lending against possible negative cash flows or clearly negative cash flows youre lending against vcs commitments to put in money over time its a different ci loan so tim you want to pick up on that western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer chief banking officerregional banking western alliance bancorp yeah thanks ken it is and as our plan and strategy discussed today indicates we recognize and adapt to a changing environment in the tech space weve got a changing competitive landscape with respect to the lenders involved and weve got a changing landscape with respect to the vcs so weve got that in evaluation we think that we are wellsuited in the space that we have a deep understanding of the space but were moving forward fully advised by what weve seen and are seeing and the changes that have presented themselves so i dont expect that this will hold a significantly larger position on our balance sheet as we move forward timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you for that color operator our next question comes from ben gerlinger with hovde group please go ahead ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc hey good afternoon i was curious if you guys i mean just kind of philosophically speaking western alliance has always been entrepreneurial in both the left and the right side of the balance sheet and it seems like on the left side you guys are retrenching youre sticking with your core clients and partially given the volatility and then also just economically speaking im sure youre tapping the brakes a little bit but as we shift beyond a recession or go through one and get through the other side has the dna changed on how western alliance operates could we see you guys reenter the markets that youve left just kind of thinking longer term growth and where that could come from kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah well first let me say culturally we pride ourselves on being entrepreneurial many people think its in on the business development side whether we bring in deposits or loan growth and i would say yeah youre correct if you think about that i think where we excel in our entrepreneurial behavior is two in times of crisis and in times of working out transactions with clients so you want to see our entrepreneurial behavior go back and look at covid and look at our hotel book which probably back then was billion we had projections of anywhere from us losing million to billion in that book right we moved quickly we put a program in place that i dont i think maybe only one other bank use which was in order to get a deferral you had to put money up so every month of deferral you wanted you actually had to put up a month of cash and while that did not seem to sit immediately well with our sponsors once they understood that what we were trying to do and get them to commit to their projects so we could then commit to any new deals that they wanted to do then we had almost uptake in that program whats the benefit of that program everyone was projecting large losses not one late payment we declared not one late payment so what you saw here okay we did have it on a rush for liquidity to run out of this bank on monday i will tell you by tuesday late afternoon we already had the basis of the plan that were talking to you about here today in terms of moving to sell down noncore assets we also believe moving quickly and by the way this was very connected to what we told everyone in  and  coming out of moving out of our efr loans capital call and subscription lines and also getting out of some western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 corporate finance credits which we thought may have some potential credit weakness down the road but we moved so quickly that that allowed us to lock up deals for the low marks that you see that we noted here on the early part of our slide deck thats the entrepreneurial behavior that we have here and so yeah you could say were retrenching right now were using all that entrepreneurial behavior to build capital to make sure we have a good deposit franchise a better deposit franchise you saw that by the way from moving our insured deposit level from to inside of five weeks we went we moved when we put our mind to do something it gets done very quickly and so yeah to one of the other former questions from one of the other analysts yeah q2q3 youre going to see sort of this flattish type of balance sheet but as we begin to emerge out of  assuming that were on track with all the capital and all the liquidity that we want to do and thats perhaps job one i just want to make sure everyone understands that our dna will be in full view again as we build into the only thing ill say is we dont need to grow as fast right again we werent rewarded for growing as fast and the other thing ill say its all going to be informed again by where the economy stands and whats happening in the economic environment and macro factors okay benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc yeah that was great color appreciate it confidence is the best capital in this environment the only other question i had is kind of just where your share price is today seeing wal under tangible book is like seeing a snowman in phoenix im just kind of curious your appetite of share purchases i know youre trying to build capital so that would fly in the face of this but just anything on that end kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah thats not in the conversation at the moment will not be in the conversation until we cross over and then the decision then will be itll be dependent upon the economy and other economic events well reassess capital management alternatives at that time but thats not something thats boy it hasnt even contemplated here or even discussed benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you appreciate the color thanks guys kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thank you operator the next question comes from brandon king with truist please go ahead brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 hey so i wanted to touch on credit and i appreciate the guidance indiscernible and i wanted to get a better sense of how you think this credit normalization process will play out for western alliance particularly for this year timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer chief banking officerregional banking western alliance bancorp sure hi tim bruckner first id say that as we look at our portfolio right now its performing and doing exactly what we want it to do in this economy were at our foundation a relationship bank and at our foundation were a direct lender and we dont enter into transactions where were complicated with mezzanine and subdebt and so forth so weve got direct frank straightforward and ongoing dialogue with each of our customers in that sense so when we talk about how were doing how we relate thats informed by those active dialogue so as you can expect right now in segments like office were out in front of the customer with dialogue in the present environment discussing so i expect that you see a stability with any economic downturn i expect that theres also a chance for some migration to criticized or special mention we dont see significant migration to us based on the direct relationship and the active dialogue that were having that holds true across all segments that we lend in brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and then my followup was that was as far as the uptick in classified assets is that kind of the general story there as well timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer chief banking officerregional banking western alliance bancorp yeah exactly brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay all right and just one more followup with the ppnr guidance within that what is the outlook for amerihome going forward for the rest of the year kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so actually quietly amerihome is having a good several weeks here and what i would tell you is that overall production margins have improved to more historic normalized levels that happened towards the end of  and it continues into the current quarter and i would kind of say that the mortgage income that we earned in  probably is about right as we move forward and whats helped us here is the retreat of a large money center bank i dont know why we just dont say wells but the retreat of wells on the correspondent lending market combined with industry capacity rationalization has paved the path towards higher margins and higher win rates and so we knew the market would have to rightsize itself its taken a little bit longer than wed like but it has it seems like its getting there now and so thats the color around amerihome at the moment western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got you so first quarter is a good base to grow flow for the rest of the year kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah more or less brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks for taking my questions operator the next question comes from gary tenner with da davidson please go ahead gary gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning wanted to ask another question just with regard to kind of the use of net inflows of deposits over the next few quarters i think the question was already asked in terms of the securities portfolio but finished the quarter at billion of cash and equivalents thats about of your total balance sheet its about double where youve been historically in most quarters at least is that sort of a level that youd kind of target over time or do you think that it trends back towards that call it level over time dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i think that can hold over time were holding a bit more cash than we usually do presently i think that can probably trend lower right but the overall liquidity position and again and as ken indicated i mean as assuming we get continued deposit recovery here our coverage of uninsured remains robust and i think that will inform what that liquidity profile has to look like in terms of what funds return and what volatility might be associated with them gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay thanks and then in terms of the ecr or the deposit costs in the quarter since ecr deposits were essentially flat in the quarter i wouldve assumed that that expense item would have moved up a little bit more given kind of the fourth quarter hikes and then the hikes we had in the first quarter so i was just wondering if there were any changes structurally to the ecr rates or anything along those lines dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah its interesting and maybe somewhat counterintuitive but whats transpired is that a lot of the funds we lost they were larger and so consequently they were higher and so we lost ecr deposits that were among the highest that we paid and so the actual rate of increase went down because the mean spread relative to say under fed funds indiscernible western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay so potentially as you talk about maybe recovering some of those ecr deposits that have flowed out that number could have a little bit volatility to it separate from the rate environment for some period of time dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah highly possible gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay thank you operator the next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw chris please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks dale just following up on that one obviously there is a correlation between your nibs and the ecrs just given the change in the deposit mix over the last year i guess how do you see that noninterest bearing mix progressing dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp in this elevated rate environment i think its fairly difficult to get say a new dda that no ecr and in noninterest bearing so i think that i mean at the same time the dollars that are still there have been through a little bit of volatility and theyre still here so my impression is that as we grow well grow outside of that and so that will continue to whittle down proportionately but i dont really see dollar exit from that category and we possibly could get some recovery as i mentioned most of the dollars that went out were in the tech space and a number of those clients have said well be back when the storm settles a little bit christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc just so i make sure thats helpful just to make sure i understand so the billion of nib you have what youre saying is the dollars shouldnt be declining at nearly the same rate as what they have but the mix will have a bias because the growth indiscernible is that the right interpretation dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well the mix will have a bias the proportionate mix will have a bias downward but the dollars will be fairly steady thats what i meant christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thats exactly okay got it and then maybe if i could you talk about the mid and the as kind of a mediumterm target you gave your efficiency for this year as you kind of exit the year i think somebody asked western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 im going to ask a little bit different the kind of the efficiency ratio of the company when were all done with the adjustments how do we think about it relative to that midtoupper40 if youre thinking out one to two years dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so thats a harder projection to make i would state that and as ken was indicating amerihome seems to be getting real legs at the moment well have to see how that plays out but if the rate environment i personally think were going to be in a declining rate environment in going into the general election and i think thats probably bullish for mortgages and with that that could be a greater proportion of our revenue than what its been for the past two quarters and their mark their efficiency ratio is in like the low so that would be something that would keep it up also the revenue piece would be meaningful christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful thank you operator our next question comes from andrew terrell with stephens please go ahead andrew andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc hey good morning question on the cet1 pickup from the dispositions so the billion of contracted sales in the second quarter gets you a bp or so cet1 pickup or bps net of the cln i guess if theres billion of loans remaining beyond that that arent contracted for sale just yet but no further cln repositioning i guess should we think about the cet1 pickup from that last billion pull is closer to kind of a basis point lift in the cet1 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well a good question so what we have here is we believe were going to be exceed so is all of that billion going to be disposed of in the second quarter i cant tell you that weve got billion contracted thatll go so is there some tail there associated with it but when its all gone theres more pickup there than just to get you over again andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay got it and then apologies if you disclosed this but how much should be msr sale impact servicing revenues this quarter and any expectation for goforward msr sales kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so the msr was sold i think on the last day of the quarter so it didnt really impact any of our servicing income for  it was a significant sized million and we did that in the face of a large money center bank thats disposing of their msrs and we did it right on top of par right on top of our marks so were very pleased that were able to get a sizable deal off that gives us a lot of optionality to when we want to come back to the market if we want to come back to the market and the size of the deals we may do smaller deals if we think the pricing could be better theres no rush to go ahead and do them western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 and so and again i would also say if the mortgage market to dales viewpoint of the world if the mortgage market begins to pick up at a faster pace then maybe i have to retreat from some of my statements and we have to do some sales but right now we dont see that were going to have to do any sales and we get all the optionality going one way as to when we want to launch a deal dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah we manufacture msrs and so if you look at the ending balance if you start with the beginning balance take out million obviously that ending balance is higher than that so its going to be a fairly stable balance on average but its going to move up and down as they manufacture them every day and then as we dispose of them periodically kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp i will say were getting a lot of reverse inquiries and people want all of them and so and well manufacture it andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay very good thanks for taking the questions kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp you bet sure thanks operator the next question comes from brody preston with ubs please go ahead brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey everyone thanks for the time so i have a few questions i just wanted to ask maybe on the asset sensitivity just given that the balance sheet sensitivity is down when i layer in the mortgage and then the deposit cost that flow through nie dale is it fair to say that the earnings stream is liability sensitive in the current rate environment dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so we probably think its pretty close to zero here and you do have a pickup potentially on the deposit cost like youre alluding to but again were showing that its a little bit assetsensitive presently but like i said less than so we put it all together and with and without deposit cost as margin or noninterest expense its pretty neutral brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and within the ppnr guidance could you share what your interest rate outlook is for fed funds western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah weve got one increase coming up at this next meeting its and then we have two go late in the year i think its november and december brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc cuts kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp cuts two cuts yeah you may not believe that thats what we have in our model basically tracks the futures running off of brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay great and then on the deposit rates i think the interestbearing deposit rate was spot versus the at quarter end the average was up i think it was like basis points to basis points quarterover quarter so just trying to help think about the stepup in deposit costs going forward do you think that the spot rate is indicative of where you would expect the deposit rate interestbearing deposit cost to come in or do you think itll kind of be another basis point or basis point increase kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp oh no oh no no i mean your spot rate is as of march so whats going to change it from there we have one rate increase in early may and then whats the proportion thats going to follow through so it could be up a little bit more than that we wouldnt expect it to be much more were not seeing kind of intra account volatility we saw some of that earlier but a lot of these are indexed at various levels to fed funds so i think its going to be more i mean the big increase you had from  to  was you had significant raises they were still doing basis points back then in  and that did layer in that kind of that for the full year on an average basis so going from to was really because the rate was held back from the average rate and how quickly they were still moving the funds back in the late brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and just on the interquarter deposit swings i think it was the march update you gave where youre up billion for the quarter could you tell us what were the categories that drove that upswing which ones kind of flowed out and how much of that you could expect to maybe get back and if thats encompassed within your guidance for deposit growth going forward dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so yeah we were up billion just under billion as you mentioned we would typically have seen some of those funds to go down a little bit we were targeting they were actually going to be up billion for the western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 quarter instead of billion because we thought wed lose a little bit in mortgage warehouse deposits in particular that would flow out we also had some other dollars and things that were going to be pulling out well that happened and in fact we had some of those dollars a little bit more than we expected and then weve mentioned settlement services which is another division i mean they were off to a very strong  in particular but those accounts had just come in i mean so we opened accounts that had been here for singledigit weeks and then with all the volatility that took place and i think it kind of spooked them a little bit when they saw our share price on monday the 13th and so they took it out now for those we do have commitments for many of them that they were kind of surprised by this and they think theyre coming back so were pretty optimistic about whats going to reverse there but it was a little bit like lifeboat last in first out i mean so a brand new account wasnt as sticky as something that had been here before with more tenure kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp they hadnt experienced our service levels and our performance it was easy for them to move but those folks that have been with us that understood service levels and performance and how important it is those funds did move and weve been on the road last week meeting with just a number of settlement service clients and future clients and there is a big pipeline thats building out there so we hope to gain our fair share of that of those settlements brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and if i could sneak one last one a little bit tickytack in just on the mortgage servicing rights that you sold could you maybe ringfence what the unpaid principal balance was i mean if i just look at the valuation it looks like it was like maybe 22ish billion i guess maybe if i get back into it but just help us ringfence that and then i just wanted to clarify that there was no gain on that that flowed through the servicing income line item this quarter kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp there was no gain on that that went through there yeah i dont have that number in front of me but i think your math is about right based upon basis points per dollar brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay great thank you for all the time this afternoon for taking my questions guys appreciate it operator the next question comes from tim coffey with janney please go ahead tim timothy coffey q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thanks good morning gentlemen kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp just before you begin indiscernible western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 timothy coffey q analyst janney montgomery scott llc im sorry what is that say that again kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp it was about billion of unpaid balances that were on the last question okay sorry sorry timothy coffey q analyst janney montgomery scott llc no no no well thanks thats actually something i needed so just given the source of stress and the deposits in march have you considered strengthening or limiting the concentration limits to deposits from the vc industry or companies funded by vcs dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well i mean our first time with these deposits is what we have when we have a credit relationship with them and so and there were several things that went on there in terms of tweets people are familiar with that i think accelerated it what weve taken note of is kind of volatility around some of this stuff and well reflect that in what how we consider what we need in hqla liquidity kind of going forward but hey were committed to the tech space and when we think that theres value to be created for us and for them in that space but maybe the duration risk is shorter than others might have thought kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp lessons learned there about a third to of our total deposits were operating accounts tied to loan commitments where we had to be the primary banking relationship those deposits didnt flow out thats number one number two the other thing i like what we did and this goes back to the original bridge team when they started the company to be a challenger brand to svb was to focus on the portfolio companies and not the venture capital funds so those dollars are less likely to flow in and out on the operating accounts than they are with the venture capital funds so that was something that was started that we continue that was i think a good decision i think for us going forward we now need to tie more of the deposit commitment to the loan documents such that if they do move money the penalty pricing is severe today its a nuisance but were going to tie and may get more severe in order to keep those deposits with us and by the by if you want a relationship and you want the experience that we bring youre going to need to bring deposits to the table and thats what we say by the way to all clients that we sit across the table from them and we say were happy to make your business very very successful thats what we want to do youve got to do the same for us so were giving you credit we need that deposit relationship and we need those sticky deposits timothy coffey q analyst janney montgomery scott llc western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 great okay thanks really thats helpful and then in terms of the deposit outlook the billion per quarter how much of that is predicated on deposits that flowed out of the bank in the last month or so coming back kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp its a mix to be honest with you i dont know that i can give you a very specific number how much is returning versus how much is new i will tell you that this whole disruption gave us an opportunity to spend more time with our clients if theres any silver lining thats good to certain clients during the heart of the disruption we were talking to them every day if they wanted to but it also gave them much more access to the senior management teams and allows us now to call on them so i cant give you a number but we feel more comfortable with the overall billion coming back per quarter billion growth per quarter timothy coffey q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay okay and since youre getting back to just old fashioned relationshipbased banking here is there a minimum interest spread that youre looking at or targeting kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so the answer is yes by different loan categories okay and as dale said were basically pricing at the margin today so effective fed funds gets offset by sofr plus and that spread is what drives us and overall the spread is very close to what you see as our net interest margin spread so different if youre doing a construction loan versus the ci loan versus a hotel loan versus a warehouse lending but the blend of those spreads are pretty much seen in our net interest margin rate timothy coffey q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay great those are my questions appreciate the time thank you operator our next question comes from david smith with autonomous research please go ahead david david smith q analyst bernsteinautonomous thank you i know were getting late just a few quick ones on capital do you have plans for additional credit linked note issuance from here given the way that youve reevaluated the existing cln base is it something youve ruled out or just kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp its something we dont need going forward at this point and its expensive david smith q analyst bernsteinautonomous got it western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp very expensive so when were done we so we dont need that incremental cost david smith q analyst bernsteinautonomous okay can you talk about what changed that led to that reevaluation because it was something that the bank had done a decent amount of in recent quarters kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp well i mean one of the benefits of them was that youve got a reduction in riskweighted assets when it held capital were moving away from that to a higher capital level so that whatever the next storm is with that and with our insured deposit levels in the top decile relative to the largest banks were not going to be in a situation for a short game and so i dont think the clns were productive in avoiding that scenario david smith q analyst bernsteinautonomous okay and with the new target is that something you view as a longterm target for western alliance or do you think it will come back down towards say after everything settles down at some point kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp i think as i said we want to be competitive with the money center banks now no one is ever going to confuse jpmorgan and western alliance as one in the same company or at least not in the next quarter let me just say that says here pause for laughter but i think one of the things we learned when were out on the road talking to nonsophisticated banking people they understand their business theyre very smart but they dont spend a lot of time for us to come in to say our capital like there are a number of studies that were done that we used that put into the model cet1 less htm marks less afs marks right and when we went in and we showed people and talked to people and said that we were one of the best in terms of this adjusted cet1 they didnt have to understand what the word adjusted meant they didnt have to understand cet1 but when they heard our percentage and compared it to a lot of the other large money center banks and we were higher than that boom they understood that as i said to folks if my mom was alive what she was she was over i made it as simple as i could if she was alive to tell her money center bank a was at were at were better money center b has insured deposit level of this were higher when people just got that very basic math the meetings went very very well and it was well understood and they were able to check the box and say lets move on david smith q analyst bernsteinautonomous got it thank you operator our final question today comes from jon arfstrom with rbc please go ahead jon western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks this can be quick the provision it looks like it was driven by a chargeoff and it feels like youre comfortable with credit and growth is slowing intentionally but anything that prevents that provision from coming way back down next quarter dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well yeah i mean it was driven by a chargeoff we had or we disclosed in there we had a debt obligation of actually signature bank and so weve written that off jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay but just in terms of the provision indiscernible kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp tim bruckners comments about credit quality they are whole jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah so you dont feel like you need to be building reserves here i guess is my kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah we dont know jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer chief banking officerregional banking western alliance bancorp not any way other than the consistency that weve seen jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes okay thats helpful and then back to the return question when you guys flesh out your model are you a midteen return on tangible company is that the goal or are you a highteen return on tangible company how do you think about that in your mind kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 in terms of return on average tangible common equity jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc return on tangible yeah kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp i think were going to be low or greater as we move forward through the end of the year and into remember too that with a smaller balance sheet and small and less spread income the fee income plays a more dominant role and thats coming from amerihome and right now were seeing we got fingers crossed when we say this were seeing the trends move in our favor and i think thats going to give us a little extra push in the return on an average tangible common equity ratio jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good thats a good message with your valuation and then i guess last question it probably wouldve been a good first question but do you feel like youre dealing with any abnormal stresses right now at your company or is this kind of over in terms of managing the stressful situations from midmarch kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp all right so i want to be careful that im not like george bush that things are signed on the aircraft carrier that says mission accomplished right jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah indiscernible kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp the waters are calmer okay so i think whats important is what we returned to a lot more calm as it relates to the depositors starting the wednesday february cash inflows and outflows are about the same and as you saw starting on the 20th or thereabouts we started to grow and weve grown and so there is calm with the depositors for us there is still a heightened level of sensitivity to make sure that everything we just said on this call gets executed upon right and that to me is an incredibly important one of course we like to be known as a company thats transparent but also when we tell you were going to do something we do it we also like to be known as trying to be a little more innovative to looking at problems and solving them and then solving them right away so if youre asking me about anxiety and what keeps me up at night is making sure that we work hard to execute on everything that weve said here if youre asking me for what the other one or two events that could be out there that maybe could impact the industry a little bit i think first republic hasnt been solved yet but i think we have now shown that we are completely different and separated from that company there was a point where whatever happens to them affected us but i think we have now separated ourselves from there western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript  earnings call 19apr2023 and the other thing that we are just waiting for is you saw that fitch gave us kept us investment grade but lower a notch or two we still have one of the rating agency that is probably going to do something or other since theyve had us on watch and were waiting for that but we saw no outflow with any impact to fitch zero no incoming calls zero and we just want that one last item to be passed and then its all about execution or its still right execution on the plan that we presented here and also working on growth so what i think you saw here during the cause of this crisis is managements dexterity ive said that to our board several times we can balance a few things keep a few balls in the air and do them well i like to think we did okay through this whole crisis here and thats whats front and center in our minds these days jon i appreciate the big question at the end jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay thanks for everything kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thank you operator those are all the questions we have ill turn the call back to ken vecchione for closing remarks kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah listen this is probably our longest call ever not surprising i would hope we answered all your questions and we look forward to the next earnings call well talk some more thank you all for your time today operator thank you everyone for joining us today this concludes our call and you may now disconnect
