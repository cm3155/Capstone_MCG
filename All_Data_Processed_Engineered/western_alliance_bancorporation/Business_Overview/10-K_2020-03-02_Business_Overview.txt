actual cre commercial and industrial construction and land development residential real estate consumer table end asset quality general to measure asset quality the company has instituted a loan grading system consisting of nine different categories the first five are considered satisfactory pass ratings the other four nonpass grades range from a special mention category to a loss category and are consistent with the grading systems used by federal banking regulators all loans are assigned a credit risk grade at the time they are made and each assigned loan officer reviews the credit with his or her immediate supervisor on a quarterly basis to determine whether a change in the credit risk grade is warranted in addition the grading of the companys loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis by its internal loan review department collection procedure if a borrower fails to make a scheduled payment on a loan bank personnel attempt to remedy the deficiency by contacting the borrower and seeking payment contacts generally are made within business days after the payment becomes past due the bank maintains regional special assets departments which generally service and collect loans rated substandard or worse each division is responsible for monitoring activity that may indicate an increased risk rating including but not limited to pastdues overdrafts and loan agreement covenant defaults loans deemed uncollectible are chargedoff nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include loans past due days or more and still accruing interest nonaccrual loans tdr loans and repossessed assets including oreo in general loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the company determines that ultimate collection of principal and interest is in doubt due to the borrowers financial condition collateral value and collection efforts a tdr loan is a loan for which the company for reasons related to a borrowers financial difficulties grants a concession to the borrower that the company would not otherwise consider other repossessed assets result from loans where the company has received title or physical possession of the borrowers assets the company

of the years ended december and however losses may be experienced in future periods criticized assets federal bank regulators require banks to classify its assets on a regular basis in addition in connection with their examinations of the bank examiners have authority to identify problem assets and if appropriate reclassify them a loan grade of special mention from the companys internal loan grading system is utilized to identify potential problem assets and loan grades of substandard doubtful and loss are utilized to identify actual problem assets the following describes the potential and actual problem assets using the companys internal loan grading system definitions table start special mention grade generally these are assets that possess potential weaknesses that warrant managements close attention these loans may involve borrowers with adverse financial trends higher debt to equity ratios or weaker liquidity positions but not to the degree of being considered a problem loan where risk of loss may be apparent loans in this category are usually performing as agreed although there may be noncompliance with financial covenants table endtable start substandard grade these assets are characterized by welldefined credit weaknesses and carry the distinct possibility that the company will sustain some loss if such weakness or deficiency is not corrected all loans days or more past due and all loans on nonaccrual status are considered at least substandard unless extraordinary circumstances would suggest otherwise table endtable start doubtful grade these assets have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts conditions and values highly questionable and improbable but because of certain known factors which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset for example capital injection perfecting liens on additional collateral and refinancing plans classification as an estimated loss is deferred until a more precise status may be determined table endtable start loss grade these assets are considered uncollectible and having such little recoverable value that it is not practical to defer writing off the asset this classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value but rather that it is not practicable or desirable to defer writing off the asset even though partial recovery may be achieved in the future table end allowance for credit losses the company must maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is established through a provision for credit losses and is reflected as a reduction in earnings loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes that collectability of the contractual principal or interest is unlikely subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance the allowance is reported at an amount believed adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectable based on evaluation of the collectability of loans and prior credit loss experience together with other factors for a detailed discussion of the companys methodology see managements discussion and analysis and financial condition critical
