ongoing covid19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the united states and international economies and financial markets the spread of covid19 in the united states has caused illness quarantines cancellation of events and travel business and school shutdowns reduction in commercial activity and financial transactions supply chain interruptions increased unemployment and overall economic and financial market instability many states including arizona where we are headquartered and california and nevada in which we have significant operations declared states of emergency these states like many others continue to be significantly impacted by the pandemic in response to the covid19 pandemic the cares act was signed into law by president trump on march the cares act provides for approximately trillion in emergency economic relief measures including among other things loan programs for small and midsized businesses and other economic relief for impacted businesses and industries including financial institutions separately and also in response to covid19 the federal reserves fomc has set the federal funds target rate ie the interest rate at which depository institutions such as the bank lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight on an uncollateralized basis to a historic low on march the fomc set the federal funds target rate at to percent in addition to the general impact of the covid19 pandemic certain provisions of the cares act and other recent legislative and regulatory relief efforts are expected to have a material impact on our operations which are further discussed below financial position and results of operations the companys financial position and results of operations as of and for the three and nine months ended september have been significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic the worsening of forecasted economic conditions from december to september attributable to the pandemic contributed to the million and million provision for credit losses recognized during the three and nine months ended september respectively under the new cecl accounting standard adopted by the company on january while the company has not to date experienced significant writeoffs related to the covid19 pandemic the continued uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the pandemic and related economic effects will continue to affect the companys estimate of its allowance for credit losses and resulting provision for credit losses to the extent the impact of the pandemic is prolonged and economic conditions continue to worsen or persist longer than forecast such estimates may be insufficient and may change significantly in the future the companys interest income also may be negatively impacted in future periods as we continue to work with our affected borrowers to defer payments interest and fees additionally net interest margin may be reduced generally as a result of the low rate environment these uncertainties and the economic environment will continue to affect earnings slow growth and may result in deterioration of asset quality in the companys loan and investment portfolios the below table details the companys exposure to borrowers in industries generally considered to be the most impacted by the covid19 pandemic september business segments loan balance

business segments that manage the significant majority of industry relationships consists of real estate secured loan amounts that have significant retail dependency while the company has not experienced disproportionate impacts among its business segments to date borrowers in the industries detailed in the table above could have greater sensitivity to the economic downturn with potentially longer recovery periods than other business lines lending operations and accommodations to borrowers the cares act created a new guaranteed unsecured loan program under the sba called the payroll protection program or the ppp which the bank participates in to fund operational costs of eligible businesses organizations and selfemployed persons during the pandemic period the sba has used funds authorized for the ppp to guarantee of the amounts loaned under the ppp by lenders to eligible small businesses nonprofits veterans organizations and tribal businesses one of the notable features of the ppp is that borrowers are eligible for loan forgiveness if borrowers maintain their staff and payroll and if loan amounts are used to cover eligible expenses such as payroll mortgage interest rents and utilities payments these loans have a twoyear term and will earn interest at a rate of the company assisted our customers with applications for resources through the program and approved over applications as of september the outstanding balance of loans originated under the ppp totaled billion the cares act permits financial institutions to suspend requirements under gaap for loan modifications to borrowers affected by covid19 and is intended to provide interpretive guidance as to conditions that would constitute a shortterm modification that would not meet the definition of a tdr this includes the following i the loan modification is made between march and the earlier of december or days after the end of the coronavirus emergency declaration and ii the applicable loan was not more than days past due as of december the company is applying this guidance to qualifying loan modifications as of september the company has outstanding modifications meeting these conditions on loans with a net balance of billion as of september further residential mortgage loans in forbearance have a net balance of million as of september the mslp supports lending to small and mediumsized businesses that were in sound financial condition before the onset of the covid19 pandemic the mslp operates through five facilities the main street new loan facility the main street priority loan facility the main street expanded loan facility the nonprofit organization new loan facility and the nonprofit organization expanded loan facility the federal reserve bank of boston maintains the legal forms and agreements for eligible borrowers and eligible lenders to participate in the mslp and continues to refine the mslps operational infrastructure and facilities the bank has registered as a lender under the mslp and continues to monitor developments related thereto capital and liquidity while the company has sufficient capital and does not anticipate any need for additional liquidity in response to the uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic the company has taken several actions to ensure the strength of its capital and liquidity position these actions include issuance of million in subordinated debt at our bank subsidiary in may establishing a federal reserve lending facility in connection with funding loans to small and mediumsized businesses and temporarily suspending stock repurchases since midapril in addition the company is also in a position to pledge additional collateral to increase its borrowing capacity with the frb if necessary further management has elected to take advantage of the capital relief option that delays the estimated impact on regulatory capital by up to two years with a threeyear transition period to phase out the cumulative benefit to regulatory capital provided during the twoyear delay asset valuation while the companys stock price has experienced volatility and periodic declines in value during the pandemic management does not consider this decline to be a triggering event that would indicate that an interim goodwill impairment test was necessary as of september continued and sustained declines in the companys stock price andor other credit related impacts could give rise to triggering events in the future that could result in a writedown in the value of our goodwill which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations our processes controls and business continuity plan the company has focused first on ensuring the wellbeing of our people customers and communities preventive health measures were put in place which included establishing social distancing precautions for all employees in the office and customers

basic earnings per share diluted nongaap financial measures the following discussion and analysis contains financial information determined by methods other than those prescribed by gaap the companys management uses these nongaap financial measures in their analysis of the companys performance management believes presentation of these nongaap financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a complete understanding of the operating results of the company since the presentation of these nongaap performance measures and their impact differ between companies these nongaap disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with gaap nor are they necessarily comparable to nongaap performance measures that may be presented by other companies preprovision net revenue ppnr is defined by the federal reserve in sr which requires companies subject to the rule to project ppnr over the planning horizon for each of the economic scenarios defined annually by the regulators banking regulations define ppnr as net interest income plus noninterest income less noninterest expense management believes that this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the company it enables investors and others to assess the companys ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through the credit cycle and provides consistent reporting with a key metric used by bank regulatory agencies the following table shows the components of ppnr for the three and nine months ended september and

table presents certain financial measures related to regulatory capital under basel iii which includes common equity tier and total capital the frb and other banking regulators use common equity tier and total capital as a basis for assessing a banks capital adequacy therefore management believes it is useful to assess financial condition and capital adequacy using this same basis specifically the total capital ratio takes into consideration the risk levels of assets and offbalance sheet financial instruments in addition management believes that the classified assets to common equity tier plus allowance measure is an important regulatory metric for assessing asset quality as permitted by the regulatory capital rules the company elected to delay the estimated impact of cecl on its regulatory

and net interest margin the companys primary source of revenue is interest income for the three months ended september interest income was million a decrease of million or compared to million for the three months ended september this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in other interest income from interest bearing cash accounts and federal funds sold of million also contributing to the decrease in total interest income were net declines in interest income from loans and investment securities each totaling million the decline in interest rates from september outweighed the increases in the related average asset balances resulting in a decrease in total interest income for the nine months ended september interest income was million an increase of million or compared to million for the nine months ended september this increase was primarily the result of a billion increase in the average loan balance which offset the decline in interest rates and drove a million increase in loan interest income for the nine months ended september this increase was offset in part by decreases in other interest income of million and interest income from investment securities of million for the comparable period due to the lower interest rate environment for the three months ended september interest expense was million a decrease of million or compared to million for the three months ended september interest expense on deposits decreased million for the same period despite an increase in average interestbearing deposits of billion as the company benefited from repricing efforts in a lower rate environment resulting in a basis point reduction in average cost of interestbearing deposits for the nine months ended september interest expense was million a decrease of million or compared to million for the nine months ended september interest expense on deposits decreased million for the same period despite an increase in average interestbearing deposits of billion resulting in a basis point reduction in average cost of interestbearing deposits for the three months ended september net interest income was million an increase of million or compared to million for the three months ended september the increase in net interest income reflects a billion increase in average interestearning assets partially offset by an increase of billion in average interestbearing liabilities the decrease in net interest margin of basis points to is largely the result of excess liquidity from deposit growth that has outpaced loan growth as well as a decrease in loan yields due to a lower rate environment and lower yields on ppp loans primarily driven by changes in prepayment assumptions that reduced net deferred loan fee accretion on ppp loans during the three months ended september these decreases to net interest margin were offset by lower deposit and funding costs for the three months ended september compared to the same period in for the nine months ended september net interest income was million an increase of million or compared to million for the nine months ended september the increase in net interest income reflects a billion increase in average interestearning assets partially offset by an increase of billion in average interestbearing liabilities the decrease in net interest margin of basis points to is the result of excess liquidity and a lower rate environment as explained in the above paragraphs provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses in each period is reflected as a reduction in earnings for that period and upon the adoption of cecl includes amounts related to funded loans unfunded loan commitments and investment securities the provision is equal to the amount required to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level that is adequate to absorb estimated lifetime credit losses inherent in the loan and investment securities portfolios for the three and nine months ended september the provision for credit losses was million and million compared to million and million for the three and nine months ended september respectively the significant increase in the provision for credit losses from the three and nine months ended september is primarily related to the current economic environment and estimating expected credit losses under the new cecl accounting standard this standard changes the methodology for estimating credit losses on financial instruments from an incurred loss model to an expected total loss model this results in the recognition of expected losses over the life of loans and htm investment securities at the time that the loan is originated or the security is purchased rather than after a loss has been incurred which results in an acceleration in the timing of loss recognition further as the companys cecl models incorporate historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts in measuring expected credit losses the worsening of economic assumptions due to the ongoing pandemic has also contributed to an elevated provision for credit losses for the nine months ended september noninterest income

decreased million due to a decrease in warrant income from the three months ended september total noninterest income for the nine months ended september compared to the same period in decreased by million the most significant decrease in noninterest income of million relates to a net fair value loss adjustment incurred during the nine months ended september as mentioned above this change is predominantly related to valuation declines on preferred stock investments in addition there was a million gain on security sales recognized during the nine months ended september that did not recur in the current period these decreases were offset in part by an increase in income from bank owned life insurance of million primarily attributable to a onetime enhancement fee of million from the

the nine months ended september and the companys effective tax rate was and respectively the increase in the effective tax rate from the three and nine months ended september is due primarily to tax

policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions the critical accounting policies upon which the companys financial condition and results of operations depend and which involve the most complex subjective decisions or assessments are included in the discussion entitled critical accounting policies in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the companys annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december and all amendments thereto as filed with the sec during the first quarter of the company adopted the asus related to credit losses which include asu measurement of credit losses on financial instruments asu codification improvements to topic financial instruments credit losses topic derivatives and hedging and topic financial instruments asu financial instruments credit losses and asu codification improvements to topic financial instrumentscredit losses the new standards significantly change the impairment model for most financial assets that are measured at amortized cost including offbalance sheet credit exposures from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model the amendments in asu require that an organization measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain in future periods evaluations of the overall loan portfolio in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses and credit loss expense in those future periods the allowance level is influenced by loan volumes loan asset quality ratings delinquency status historical credit loss experience loan performance characteristics and other conditions influencing loss expectations such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions changes to the assumptions in the model in future periods could have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements see note summary of significant accounting policies for a detailed discussion of the companys methodologies for estimating expected credit losses there were no other material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in the companys annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december liquidity liquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals fund asset growth and business operations and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in the companys business operations or unanticipated events including the ongoing covid19 pandemic the ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay fully maturing liabilities is of primary importance to depositors creditors and regulators the companys liquidity represented by cash and amounts due from banks federal funds sold and nonpledged marketable securities is a result of the companys operating investing and financing activities and related cash flows in order to ensure funds are available when necessary on at least a quarterly basis the company projects the amount of funds that will be required over a twelvemonth period and it also strives to maintain relationships with a diversified customer base liquidity requirements can also be met through shortterm borrowings or the disposition of shortterm assets while the company does not anticipate any need for additional liquidity in response to the uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic the company has taken several actions to ensure the strength of its liquidity position these actions include establishing a billion federal reserve lending facility in connection with funding loans to small and mediumsized businesses and suspending stock repurchases effective as of april in addition the company is also in a position to pledge additional collateral to increase its borrowing capacity with the frb if necessary the following table presents the available and outstanding balances on the companys lines of credit september available balance outstanding balance in millions unsecured fed funds credit lines at correspondent banks in addition to lines of credit the company has borrowing capacity with the fhlb and frb from pledged loans and securities the borrowing capacity outstanding borrowings and available credit as of september are presented in the following table september in millions fhlb borrowing capacity outstanding borrowings letters of credit total available credit frb borrowing capacity outstanding borrowings total available credit the company has a formal liquidity policy and in the opinion of management its liquid assets are considered adequate to meet cash flow needs for loan funding and deposit cash withdrawals for the next days at september there was billion in liquid assets comprised of billion in cash and cash equivalents and billion in unpledged marketable securities at december the company maintained billion in liquid assets comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents and billion of unpledged marketable securities the parent maintains liquidity that would be sufficient to fund its operations and certain nonbank affiliate operations for an extended period should funding from normal sources be disrupted since deposits are taken by wab and not by the parent parent liquidity is not dependent on the banks deposit balances in the companys analysis of parent liquidity it is assumed that the parent is unable to generate funds from additional debt or equity issuances receives no dividend income from subsidiaries and does not pay dividends to stockholders while continuing to make nondiscretionary payments needed to maintain operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the parent and affiliated companies under this scenario the amount of time the parent and its nonbank subsidiary can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered as part of the parent liquidity analysis management believes the parent maintains adequate liquidity capacity to operate without additional funding from new sources for over twelve months wab maintains sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements such as deposit outflows this capacity is comprised of liquidity derived from a reduction in asset levels and various secured funding sources on a longterm basis the companys liquidity will be met by changing the relative distribution of its asset portfolios for example by reducing investment or loan volumes or selling or encumbering assets further the company can increase liquidity by soliciting higher levels of deposit accounts through promotional activities andor borrowing from correspondent banks the fhlb of san francisco and the frb at september the companys longterm liquidity needs primarily relate to funds required to support loan originations commitments and deposit withdrawals which can be met by cash flows from investment payments and maturities and investment sales if necessary the companys liquidity is comprised of three primary classifications cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities and cash flows provided by financing activities net cash provided by or used in operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for changes in certain other asset and liability accounts and certain noncash income and expense items such as the provision for credit losses investment and other amortization and depreciation for the nine months ended september and net cash provided by operating activities was million and million respectively the companys primary investing activities are the origination of real estate and commercial loans the collection of repayments of these loans and the purchase and sale of securities the companys net cash provided by and used in investing activities has been primarily influenced by its loan and securities activities the net increase in loans for the nine months ended september and was billion and billion respectively there was a net increase in investment securities for the nine months ended september and of million and million respectively net cash provided by financing activities has been impacted significantly by increased deposit levels during the nine months ended september and net deposits increased billion and billion respectively fluctuations in core deposit levels may increase the companys need for liquidity as certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity and as nonmaturity deposits such as checking and savings account balances are withdrawn additionally the company is exposed to the risk that customers with large deposit balances will withdraw all or a portion of such deposits due in part to the fdic limitations on the amount of insurance coverage provided to depositors to mitigate the uninsured deposit risk the company participates in the cdars and ics programs which allow an individual customer to invest up to million and million respectively through one participating financial institution or a combined total of million per individual customer with the entire amount being covered by fdic insurance as of september the company has million of cdars and billion of ics deposits as of september the company has million of wholesale brokered deposits outstanding brokered deposits are generally considered to be deposits that have been received from a third party who is engaged in the business of placing deposits on behalf of others a traditional deposit broker will direct deposits to the banking institution offering the highest interest rate available federal banking laws and regulations place restrictions on depository institutions regarding brokered deposits because of the general concern that these deposits are not relationship based and are at a greater risk of being withdrawn and placed on deposit at another institution offering a higher interest rate thus posing liquidity risk for institutions that gather brokered deposits in significant amounts federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid the total amount of dividends which may be paid at any date is generally limited to the retained earnings of the bank dividends paid by wab to the parent would be prohibited if the effect thereof would cause the banks capital to be reduced below applicable minimum capital requirements during the three and nine months ended september wab paid dividends to the parent of million and million respectively subsequent to september wab paid dividends to the parent of million recent accounting pronouncements
