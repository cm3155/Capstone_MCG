analysis contains financial information determined by methods other than those prescribed by gaap the companys management uses these nongaap financial measures in their analysis of the companys performance management believes presentation of these nongaap financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a complete understanding of the operating results of the company since the presentation of these nongaap performance measures and their impact differ between companies these nongaap disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with gaap nor are they necessarily comparable to nongaap performance measures that may be presented by other companies preprovision net revenue banking regulations define ppnr as the sum of net interest income and noninterest income less expenses before adjusting for loss provisions management believes that this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the company it enables investors and others to assess the companys ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through the credit cycle and provides consistent reporting with a key metric used by bank regulatory agencies the following table shows the components used in the calculation of ppnr three months ended march in millions total noninterest income net interest income

financial measures related to regulatory capital under basel iii which includes cet1 and total capital the frb and other banking regulators use cet1 and total capital as a basis for assessing a banks capital adequacy therefore management believes it is useful to assess financial condition and capital adequacy using this same basis specifically the total capital ratio takes into consideration the risk levels of assets and offbalance sheet financial instruments in addition management believes that the classified assets to cet1 plus allowance measure is an important regulatory metric for assessing asset quality as permitted by the regulatory capital rules the company elected the cecl transition option that delayed the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption
