prescribed by gaap the companys management uses these nongaap financial measures in their analysis of the companys performance management believes presentation of these nongaap financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a complete understanding of the operating results of the company since the presentation of these nongaap performance measures and their impact differ between companies these nongaap disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with gaap nor are they necessarily comparable to nongaap performance measures that may be presented by other companies preprovision net revenue ppnr is defined by the federal reserve in sr which requires companies subject to the rule to project ppnr over the planning horizon for each of the economic scenarios defined annually by the regulators banking regulations define ppnr as net interest income plus noninterest income less noninterest expense management believes that this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the company it enables investors and others to assess the companys ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through the credit cycle and provides consistent reporting with a key metric used by bank regulatory agencies the following table shows the components of ppnr for the three months

to regulatory capital under basel iii which includes common equity tier and total capital the frb and other banking regulators use cet1 and total capital as a basis for assessing a banks capital adequacy therefore management believes it is useful to assess financial condition and capital adequacy using this same basis specifically the total capital ratio takes into consideration the risk levels of assets and offbalance sheet financial instruments in addition management believes that the classified assets to cet1 plus allowance measure is an important regulatory metric for assessing asset quality as permitted by the regulatory capital rules the company elected to delay the estimated impact of cecl on its regulatory capital over a fiveyear transition period ending december as a

attributable to both volume and rate are designated as volume changes comparison of interest income interest expense and net interest margin the companys primary source of revenue is interest income for the three months ended march interest income was million an increase of million or compared to million for the three months ended march this increase was primarily the result of a billion increase in the average loan balance that drove a million increase in interest income from loans from the three months ended march interest income from investment securities also increased by million for the

federal funds sold of million for the three months ended march interest expense was million a decrease of million or compared to million for the three months ended march interest expense on deposits decreased million for the same period despite an increase in average interestbearing deposits of billion as the company benefited from repricing efforts in a lower rate environment resulting in a

ended march the increase in net interest income reflects a billion increase in average interestearning assets partially offset by an increase of billion in average interestbearing liabilities the decrease in net interest margin of basis points to is largely the result of excess liquidity from deposit growth that has outpaced loan growth as well as a decrease in loan yields due to a lower rate environment and lower yields during the three months ended march these decreases to net interest margin were offset by lower deposit and funding costs for the three months ended march compared to the same period in provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses in each period is reflected as a reduction in earnings for that period and includes amounts related to funded loans unfunded loan commitments and investment securities the provision is equal to the amount required to maintain the allowance for credit losses at a level that is adequate to absorb estimated lifetime credit losses inherent in the loan and investment securities portfolios at the time that the loan is originated or the security is purchased the companys cecl models incorporate historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts in measuring expected credit losses for the three months ended march a release of credit loss provisions of million was recognized compared to a
