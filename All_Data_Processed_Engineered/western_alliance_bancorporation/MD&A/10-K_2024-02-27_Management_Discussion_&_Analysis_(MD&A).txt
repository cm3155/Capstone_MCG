prescribed by gaap the companys management uses these nongaap financial measures in their analysis of the companys performance management believes presentation of these nongaap financial measures provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a complete understanding of the operating results of the company since the presentation of these nongaap performance measures and their impact differ between companies these nongaap disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with gaap nor are they necessarily comparable to nongaap performance measures that may be presented by other companies preprovision net revenue banking regulations define ppnr as the sum of net interest income and noninterest income less expenses before adjusting for loss provisions management believes this is an important metric as it illustrates the underlying performance of the company it enables investors and others to assess the companys ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through the credit cycle and provides consistent reporting with a key metric used by bank regulatory agencies the following table shows the components used in the calculation of ppnr table start year ended december in millions net interest income total noninterest income net revenue total noninterest expense preprovision net revenue less provision for

useful to assess financial condition and capital adequacy using this same basis specifically the total capital ratio takes into consideration the risk levels of assets and offbalance sheet financial instruments in addition management believes the classified assets to cet1 plus allowance measure is an important regulatory metric for assessing asset quality as permitted by the regulatory capital rules the company elected the cecl transition option that delayed the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of cecl over a fiveyear transition period ending december

subject to liquidity and other regulatory requirements as administered by the federal banking agencies these agencies have broad powers and at their discretion could limit or prohibit the companys payment of dividends payment of certain debt service and issuance of capital stock and debt as they deem appropriate and as such actions by the agencies could have a direct material effect on the companys business and financial statements the company is also required to maintain specified levels of capital to remain in good standing with certain federal government agencies including fnma fhlmc gnma and hud these capital requirements are generally tied to the unpaid balances of loans included in the companys servicing portfolio or loan production volume noncompliance with these capital requirements can result in various remedial actions up to and including removing the companys ability to sell loans to and service loans on behalf of the respective agency the company believes it is in compliance with these requirements as of december critical accounting estimates the notes to the consolidated financial statements contain a discussion of the companys significant accounting policies including information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements adoption of such policies and the related impact of their adoption the company believes certain of these policies along with various estimates it is required to make in recording its financial transactions are important to have a complete understanding of the companys financial position in addition these estimates require management to make complex and subjective judgments many of which include matters with a high degree of uncertainty the following is a summary of these critical accounting policies and significant estimates allowance for credit losses the acl guidance requires an organization to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date including offbalance sheet credit exposures based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain in future periods evaluations of the overall loan portfolio in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing may result in significant changes in the acl and credit loss expense in those future periods the allowance level is influenced by loan volumes and mix average remaining maturities loan performance metrics asset quality characteristics delinquency status historical credit loss experience and other conditions influencing loss expectations such as reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions during the year ended december the allowance level was most impacted by the bank failures in and heightened economic uncertainty particularly in the commercial real estate market which resulted in recognition of a provision for credit losses of million changes to the assumptions in the model in future periods could have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements see note summary of significant accounting policies in item of this form 10k for a detailed discussion of the companys methodologies for estimating expected credit losses fair value of financial instruments the company uses fair value measurements to recognize certain financial instruments at fair value the company holds financial instruments including loans hfs msrs and derivative instruments that are recorded at fair value and require management to make significant judgments in estimating the fair value of these financial instruments the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market inputs for financial instruments that are actively traded and have quoted market prices or observable market inputs there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value however when quoted market prices or observable market inputs are not fully available significant management judgment may be necessary to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments the fair value of msrs is determined using a discounted cash flow model based on certain unobservable inputs assumptions used to value the companys msrs represent managements best estimate of assumptions market participants would use to value this asset and may require significant judgment the primary risk of material changes to the value of the msrs resides in the potential volatility and judgment in the assumptions used specifically prepayment speeds option adjusted spreads and discount rates hypothetical changes in the value of msrs based on assumed immediate changes in certain inputs are disclosed in note mortgage servicing rights in item of this form 10k goodwill impairment the company performs its annual goodwill impairment test as of october each year or more often if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as described in note summary of significant accounting policies in item of this form 10k the company may first elect to assess through qualitative factors whether it is more likely than not goodwill is impaired this qualitative assessment includes consideration of relevant events and circumstances such as macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors overall financial performance other events specific to the company significant events affecting a reporting unit and a sustained decrease in stock price if after assessing all relevant events or circumstances the qualitative assessment indicates potential impairment a quantitative impairment test is performed a quantitative valuation involves determining the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing the fair value to its corresponding carrying amount if based on the quantitative test a reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value a goodwill impairment charge for this difference is recorded to current period earnings as noninterest expense after considering the economic uncertainty and market volatility resulting from the rising rate environment and the industry disruption from the bank failures in which impacted the companys stock price and market capitalization the company elected to perform a quantitative valuation to assess goodwill impairment for each of its reporting units as of october the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments particularly related to forecasted cash flows the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium the determination of the fair value of the companys reporting units as of october employed both an income and a market approach the income approach utilizes the reporting units forecasted cash flows including a terminal value approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the forecast and the reporting units estimated cost of equity as the discount rate to estimate value significant management judgment is necessary in the preparation of each reporting units forecasted cash flows as it relates to expectations for earnings projections growth and credit loss expectations and actual results may differ from forecasted results the market approach relies upon valuation multiples derived from stock prices and enterprise values of publicly traded companies and also incorporates a control premium to develop an estimate of value the selection of comparable companies and an appropriate control premium under this approach is subjective changes to any of these assumptions or judgments either individually or collectively may have a significant effect on the estimated fair value of the companys reporting units as calculated under both these approaches based on the results of the companys annual goodwill impairment test the fair value of each of the companys reporting units with goodwill exceeded its carrying value the company monitored events and circumstances during the period from october through december including macroeconomic conditions industry and market events and companyspecific performance indicators and concluded it was not more likely than not the fair value of each of the companys reporting units was below its respective carrying value as of december therefore no impairment charges were recorded during the year ended december the carrying value of goodwill by reporting unit is disclosed in note goodwill and other intangible assets in item of this form 10k income taxes the companys income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid the company is subject to federal and state income taxes in the united states significant judgments and estimates are required in the determination of the consolidated income tax expense deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future in evaluating the companys ability to recover its dtas in the jurisdictions from which they arise all available positive and negative evidence is considered including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities tax planning strategies projected future taxable income and recent operating results the assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying business liquidity liquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals fund asset growth and business operations and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in the companys business operations or unanticipated events the ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay fully maturing liabilities is of primary importance to depositors creditors and regulators the companys liquidity represented by cash and amounts due from banks federal funds sold loans hfs and nonpledged

termination of the trust the lesser of the liquidation amount and all accrued and unpaid distributions and the amount of assets of the trust remaining available for distribution the company does not believe these offbalance sheet arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on its financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources however there can be no assurance such arrangements will not have a future effect the company has a formal liquidity policy and in the opinion of management its liquid assets are considered adequate to meet financial obligations and support client activity during normal and stressed operating conditions at december there were billion in liquid assets comprised of million in cash on deposit at the frb and billion in liquid securities not currently used as collateral for borrowings or other purposes the company had billion in unpledged marketable securities at december the parent maintains liquidity that would be sufficient to fund its operations and certain nonbank affiliate operations for an extended period should funding from normal sources be disrupted in the companys analysis of parent liquidity it is assumed the parent is unable to generate funds from additional debt or equity issuances receives no dividend income from subsidiaries and does not pay dividends to stockholders while continuing to make nondiscretionary payments needed to maintain operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the parent and affiliated companies under this scenario the amount of time the parent and its nonbank subsidiary can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered as part of the parent liquidity analysis management believes the parent maintains adequate liquidity capacity to operate without additional funding from new sources for over twelve months wab maintains sufficient funding capacity to address large increases in funding requirements such as deposit outflows this capacity is comprised of liquidity derived from a reduction in asset levels and various secured funding sources on a longterm basis the companys liquidity will be met by changing the relative distribution of its asset portfolios for example by reducing investment or loan volumes or selling or encumbering assets further the company can increase liquidity by soliciting higher levels of deposit accounts through promotional activities andor borrowing from correspondent banks the fhlb of san francisco and the frb at december the companys longterm liquidity needs primarily relate to funds required to support loan originations commitments and deposit withdrawals which can be met by cash flows from investment payments and maturities and investment sales if necessary the companys liquidity is comprised of three primary classifications cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities and cash flows provided by financing activities net cash provided by or used in operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for changes in certain other asset and liability accounts and certain noncash income and expense items such as the provision for credit losses investment and other amortization and depreciation for the years ended december and net cash used in provided by operating activities was million billion and billion respectively the companys primary investing activities are the origination of real estate and commercial loans the collection of repayments of these loans and the purchase and sale of securities the companys net cash used in investing activities has been primarily influenced by its loan and securities activities during the year ended december the companys cash balance increased by billion as a result of a net decrease in loans compared to a reduction in cash of billion during the year ended december primarily from a net increase in loans a net increase in investment securities of billion and billion for the years ended december and respectively partially offset the increase to the companys cash balance during the year ended december and contributed to the reduction during the year ended december net cash provided by financing activities has been impacted significantly by deposit levels during the years ended december and net deposits increased billion billion and billion respectively fluctuations in core deposit levels may increase the companys need for liquidity as certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity and as nonmaturity deposits such as checking and savings account balances are withdrawn additionally the company is exposed to the risk that customers with large deposit balances will withdraw all or a portion of such deposits due in part to the fdic limitations on the amount of insurance coverage provided to depositors to mitigate the uninsured deposit risk the company participates in the cdars and ics programs which allow an individual customer to invest up to million and million respectively through one participating financial institution or a combined total of million per individual customer with the entire amount being covered by fdic insurance as of december the company has billion of cdars and billion of ics deposits as of december the company has billion of wholesale brokered deposits outstanding brokered deposits are generally considered to be deposits that have been received from a third party who is engaged in the business of placing deposits on behalf of others a traditional deposit broker will direct deposits to the banking institution offering the highest interest rate available federal banking laws and regulations place restrictions on depository institutions regarding brokered deposits because of the general concern that these deposits are not relationship based and are at a greater risk of being withdrawn and placed on deposit at another institution offering a higher interest rate thus posing liquidity risk for institutions that gather brokered deposits in significant amounts federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid the total amount of dividends which may be paid at any date is generally limited to the retained earnings of the bank dividends paid by wab to the parent would be prohibited if the effect thereof would cause the banks capital to be reduced below applicable minimum capital

subject to limitations under delaware law on the payment of dividends under the delaware general corporation law dividends may only be paid out of surplus or out of net profits for the year in which the dividend is declared or the preceding year and no dividends may be paid on common stock at any time during which the capital of outstanding preferred stock or preference stock exceeds the companys net assets from time to time the company may become a party to financing agreements and other contractual obligations that have the effect of limiting or prohibiting the declaration or payment of dividends under certain circumstances holding company expenses and obligations with respect to its outstanding preferred stock trust preferred securities and subordinated debt also may limit or impair the companys ability to declare and pay dividends since the company has no significant assets other than the voting stock of its subsidiaries it currently depends on dividends from wab and to a lesser extent its nonbank subsidiaries for a substantial portion of its revenue and as the primary sources of its cash flow the ability of a state member bank such as wab to pay cash dividends is subject to restrictions by the frb and the state of arizona the frbs regulation h states that a member bank may not declare or pay a dividend if the total of all dividends declared during that calendar year exceed the banks net income during that calendar year and the retained net income of the prior two years further without receiving prior approval from both the frb and twothirds of its stockholders a bank cannot declare or pay a dividend that would exceed its undivided profits or withdraw any portion of its permanent capital under section of the arizona revised statutes wab may pay dividends on the same basis as any other arizona corporation except that cash dividends paid out of capital surplus require the prior approval of the arizona superintendent under section of the arizona revised statutes a corporation may not make a distribution to stockholders if to do so would render the corporation insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they become due however an arizona bank may not declare a nonstock dividend out of capital surplus without the approval of the arizona superintendent federal reserve system as a member of the federal reserve system wab has historically been required by law to maintain reserves against its transaction deposits which were to be held in cash or with the frb in response to the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve reduced the reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective on march additionally on june the federal reserve adopted amendments to regulation d reserve requirements of depository institutions cfr part to eliminate references to an interest on required reserves rate and to an interest on excess reserves rate and replace them with a reference to a single interest on reserve balances rate the amendments also simplified the formula used to calculate the amount of interest paid on balances maintained by or on behalf of eligible institutions in master accounts at federal reserve banks and to made other conforming amendments the rule became effective on july bank term funding program in response to the bank failures that occurred earlier in the federal reserve system has established the btfp which is intended to provide additional funding to eligible depository institutions to help ensure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors the btfp functions similarly to the federal reserves traditional discount window offering loans of up to one year in length to eligible depository institutions pledging any collateral eligible for purchase by the federal reserve banks in open market operations for example us treasuries us agency securities and us agency mortgagebacked securities which are valued at par the us department of the treasury will provide billion as credit protection to the federal reserve banks in connection with the btfp the btfps goal is to be an additional source of liquidity against high quality securities eliminating an institutions need to quickly sell those securities in times of stress the company borrowed billion under the btfp all of which was repaid as of december source of strength doctrine frb policy requires bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks section of the doddfrank act codified the requirement that bank holding companies act as a source of financial strength as a result the company is expected to commit resources to support wab including at times when the company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks the us bankruptcy code provides that in the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal banking agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment capital adequacy the capital rules established a comprehensive capital framework for us banking organizations the capital rules generally implement the basel committees basel iii final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards the capital rules revise the definitions and the components of regulatory capital as well as address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions regulatory capital ratios the capital rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in banking institutions regulatory capital ratios and replaced the existing general riskweighting approach with a more risksensitive approach the capital rules i include cet1 and the related regulatory capital ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets ii specify that tier capital consists of cet1 and additional tier capital instruments meeting certain revised requirements iii mandate that most deductionsadjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to cet1 and not to the other components of capital and iv expand the scope of the deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations under the capital rules for most banking organizations the most common form of additional tier capital is noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common forms of tier capital are subordinated notes and a portion of the allocation for loan and lease losses in each case subject to the capital rules specific requirements pursuant to the capital rules the minimum capital ratios are as follows cet1 to riskweighted assets tier capital that is cet1 plus additional tier capital to riskweighted assets total capital that is tier capital plus tier capital to riskweighted assets and tier capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements called leverage ratio the capital rules also include a capital conservation buffer composed entirely of cet1 in addition to these minimum riskweighted asset ratios the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking institutions with a ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends equity and other capital instrument repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall thus the capital standards applicable to the company include an additional capital conservation buffer of of cet1 effectively resulting in minimum ratios inclusive of the capital conservation buffer of i cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least ii tier capital to riskweighted assets of at least and iii total capital to riskweighted assets of at least the capital rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 these include for example the requirement that mortgage servicing assets dtas arising from temporary differences that could not be realized through net operating loss carrybacks and significant investments in nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from cet1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds of cet1 or all such items in the aggregate exceed of cet1 the capital rules further prescribe that the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss items reported as a component of stockholders equity be included in cet1 capital however nonadvanced approaches banking organizations may make a onetime permanent election to exclude these items the company as a nonadvanced approaches institution has made this onetime election the capital rules also preclude certain hybrid securities such as trust preferred securities issued on or after may from inclusion in bank holding companies tier capital the company has used trust preferred securities in the past as a tool for raising additional tier capital and otherwise improving its regulatory capital ratios although the company may continue to include its existing trust preferred securities as tier capital the prohibition on the use of these securities as tier capital going forward may limit the companys ability to raise capital in the future the riskweighting categories in the capital rules are standardized and include a risksensitive number of categories depending on the nature of the assets generally ranging from for us government and agency securities to for certain equity exposures and up to risk weights for a variety of higher risk asset classes as of april final rules became effective simplifying the capital treatment for mortgage servicing assets certain dtas investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions and minority interest management believes the company is in compliance and will continue to be in compliance with the targeted capital ratios in response to the covid19 pandemic the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule in late august that allows institutions that adopted the cecl accounting standard in to mitigate cecls estimated effects on regulatory capital for two years followed by a threeyear transition period the company has elected this capital relief option prompt corrective action and safety and soundness pursuant to section of the fdia federal banking agencies are required to take prompt corrective action should a depository institution fail to meet certain capital adequacy standards at each successive lower capital category an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions including restrictions on growth restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits furthermore if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan based upon its capital levels a bank that is classified as wellcapitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency after notice and opportunity for hearing determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment for purposes of prompt corrective action to be i wellcapitalized a bank must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least a tier risk based capital ratio of at least a cet1 risk based capital ratio of at least and a tier leverage ratio of at least ii adequately capitalized a bank must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least a tier risk based capital ratio of at least a cet1 risk based capital ratio of at least and a tier leverage ratio of at least iii undercapitalized a bank would have a total risk based capital ratio of less than a tier risk based capital ratio of less than a cet1 risk based capital ratio of less than and a tier leverage ratio of less than iv significantly undercapitalized a bank would have a total risk based capital ratio of less than a tier risk based capital ratio of less than a cet1 risk based capital ratio of less than and a tier leverage ratio of less than v critically undercapitalized a bank would have a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is less than or equal to bank holding companies and insured banks also may be subject to potential enforcement actions of varying levels of severity by the federal banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business or for violation of any law rule regulation condition imposed in writing by the agency or term of a written agreement with the agency in more serious cases enforcement actions may include i the issuance of directives to increase capital ii the issuance of formal and informal agreements iii the imposition of civil monetary penalties iv the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced v the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers directors and other institutionaffiliated parties vi the termination of the banks deposit insurance vii the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank and viii the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted transactions with affiliates and insiders under federal law transactions between insured depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by sections and of the fra and regulation w in a bank holding company context at a minimum the parent holding company of a bank and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank generally sections and of the fra are intended to protect insured depository institutions from losses arising from transactions with noninsured affiliates by limiting the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate and with all affiliates of the bank in the aggregate and requiring such transactions be on terms consistent with safe and sound banking practices further section 22h of the fra and its implementing regulation o restricts loans to directors executive officers and principal stockholders insiders under section 22h loans to insiders and their related interests may not exceed together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated entities the institutions total capital and surplus loans to insiders above specified amounts must receive the prior approval of the bod further under section 22h of the fra loans to directors executive officers and principal stockholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons except that such insiders may receive preferential loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the banks employees and does not give preference to the insider over the employees section 22g of the fra places additional limitations on loans to executive officers lending limits in addition to the requirements set forth above state banking law generally limits the amount of funds that a statechartered bank may lend to a single borrower under section of the arizona revised statutes the obligations of one borrower to a bank may not exceed of the banks capital plus an additional of its capital if the additional amounts are fully secured by readily marketable collateral brokered deposits section of the fdia and fdic regulations generally limit the ability of any bank to accept renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless it is well capitalized or with the fdics approval adequately capitalized on december the fdic issued rules to revise brokered deposit regulations in light of modern deposittaking methods the rules established a new framework for certain provisions of the deposit broker definition and amended the fdics interest rate methodology calculating rates and rate caps the rules became effective on april and to date there has been no material impact to either the company or the bank from the rules consumer protection and cfpb supervision the doddfrank act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the cfpb an independent agency charged with responsibility for implementing enforcing and examining compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws the company is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population these laws include the equal credit opportunity act the fair credit reporting act the fair debt collection procedures act the truth in lending act the home mortgage disclosure act the real estate settlement practices act various state law counterparts and the consumer financial protection act of which is part of the doddfrank act the doddfrank act does not prevent states from adopting stricter consumer protection standards state regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect the companys business financial condition or operations depositor preference the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of depositors of the institution including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the parent bank holding company with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution federal deposit insurance substantially all of the deposits of wab are insured up to applicable limits by the fdics dif the basic limit on fdic deposit insurance is per depositor wab is subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif the fdic uses a riskbased assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a banks camels rating the risk matrix utilizes different risk categories distinguished by capital levels and supervisory ratings as a result of the doddfrank act the base for insurance assessments is now consolidated average assets less average tangible equity assessment rates are calculated using formulas that take into account the risk of the institution being assessed wab is classified as and subject to the scorecard for a large and highly complex institution to determine its total base assessment rate under the fdia the fdic may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by the fdic the companys management is not aware of any practice condition or violation that might lead to the termination of its deposit insurance to recover the loss to the deposit insurance fund arising from the bank failures that occurred earlier in the fdic approved an annual special assessment rate of approximately basis points the assessment base for the special assessments would be equal to an institutions estimated uninsured deposits as of december adjusted to exclude the first billion of estimated uninsured deposits the special assessments will be collected over an eightquarter collection period at a quarterly special assessment rate of basis points with the first quarterly assessment period beginning on january however the amount of the total special assessment is subject to adjustment and will not be finalized by the fdic until after termination of the receiverships in connection with the special assessment the company recognized a charge of million during the year ended december financial privacy and data security the company is subject to federal laws including the glba and certain state laws containing consumer privacy protection provisions these provisions limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to affiliated and nonaffiliated third parties and limit the reuse of certain consumer information received from nonaffiliated institutions these provisions require notice of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to affiliates or nonaffiliated third parties by means of opt out or opt in authorizations for example in august the cfpb published its final rule to update regulation p pursuant to the amended glba under this rule certain qualifying financial institutions are not required to provide annual privacy notices to customers to qualify a financial institution must not share nonpublic personal information about customers except as described in certain statutory exceptions that do not trigger a customers statutory optout right in addition the financial institution must not have changed its disclosure policies and practices from those disclosed in its most recent privacy notice the rule sets forth timing requirements for delivery of annual privacy notices in the event a financial institution that qualified for the annual notice exemption later changes its policies or practices in such a way that it no longer qualifies for the exemption the glba also requires financial institutions to implement comprehensive written information security programs that include administrative technical and physical safeguards to protect consumer information further pursuant to interpretive guidance issued under the glba and certain state laws financial institutions are required to notify customers of security breaches resulting in unauthorized access to their nonpublic personal information for example under california law every business that owns or licenses personal information about a california resident must maintain reasonable security procedures and policies to protect that information and comply with specific requirements relating to the destruction of records containing personal information and disclosure of breaches to customers and restrictions on the use of customer information unless the customer opts in other states including arizona and nevada where wab has branches may also have applicable laws requiring businesses that retain consumer personal information to develop reasonable security policies and procedures notify consumers of a security breach or provide disclosures about the use and sharing of consumer personal information the federal banking regulators have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and cybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of a financial institutions board of directors these guidelines along with related regulatory materials increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the provision of financial products and services the federal banking agencies expect financial institutions to establish lines of defense and ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials and also expect financial institutions to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure rapid recovery resumption and maintenance of the institutions operations after a cyberattack in addition all federal and state banking regulators continue to increase focus on cybersecurity programs and risks as part of regular supervisory exams on november the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule to improve the sharing of information about cyber incidents that may affect the us banking system the rule requires a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulator of any significant computersecurity incident as soon as possible and no later than hours after the banking organization determines a cyber incident has occurred notification is required for incidents that have materially affectedor are reasonably likely to materially affectthe viability of a banking organizations operations its ability to deliver banking products and services or the stability of the financial sector in addition the rule requires a bank service provider to notify affected banking organization customers as soon as possible when the provider determines that it has experienced a computersecurity incident that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect banking organization customers for four or more hours the rule became effective may community reinvestment act and fair lending laws wab has a responsibility under the cra to help meet the credit needs of its communities including low and moderate income neighborhoods the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institutions discretion to develop the types of products and services it believes are best suited to its particular community consistent with the cra on october the federal bank regulatory agencies jointly issued a final rule to modernize cra regulations consistent with the following key goals to encourage banks to expand access to credit investment and banking services in low to moderate income communities to adapt to changes in the banking industry including internet and mobile banking and the growth of nonbranch delivery systems to provide greater clarity and consistency in the application of the cra regulations including adoption of a new metricsbased approach to evaluating bank retail lending and community development financing and to tailor cra evaluations and data collection to bank size and type recognizing differences in bank size and business models may impact cra evaluations and qualifying activities most of the final cra rules requirements will be applicable beginning january with certain requirements including the data reporting requirements applicable as of january wab is currently evaluating the impact of the modified cra regulations but does not anticipate any resulting material impact to its operations or compliance objectives in addition the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act prohibit discrimination in lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes wabs failure to comply with the provisions of the cra could at a minimum result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the activities of the company wabs failure to comply with the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act could result in enforcement actions wab received a rating of satisfactory in its most recent cra examination in april federal home loan bank of san francisco wab is a member of the fhlb of san francisco which is one of regional fhlbs that provide funding to their members to support residential lending as well as affordable housing and community development loans each fhlb serves as a reserve or central bank for the members within its assigned region each fhlb makes loans to its members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the fhlb as a member wab must purchase and maintain stock in the fhlb of san francisco at december wabs total investment in fhlb stock was million incentive compensation the doddfrank act requires the federal banking agencies and the sec to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements at specified regulated entities including the company and wab with at least billion in total consolidated assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer employee director or principal stockholder with excessive compensation fees or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the entity the federal banking agencies and the sec most recently proposed such regulations in but the regulations have not yet been finalized if the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed they will restrict the manner in which executive compensation is structured the doddfrank act also requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a nonbinding vote on executive compensation at least every three years and on socalled golden parachute payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions wal gives stockholders a nonbinding vote on executive compensation annually preventing suspicious activity under title iii of the usa patriot act all financial institutions are required to take certain measures to identify their customers prevent money laundering monitor customer transactions and report suspicious activity to us law enforcement agencies financial institutions are also required to respond to

complying financial institutions from the privacy provisions of the glba and other privacy laws financial institutions that hold correspondent accounts for foreign banks or provide private banking services to foreign individuals are required to take measures to avoid dealing with certain foreign individuals or entities including foreign banks with profiles that raise money laundering concerns and are prohibited from dealing with foreign shell banks and persons from jurisdictions of particular concern the primary federal banking agencies and the secretary of the treasury have adopted regulations to implement several of these provisions all financial institutions are also required to establish internal antimoney laundering programs the effectiveness of a financial institution in combating money laundering activities is a factor to be considered in any application submitted by the financial institution under the bank merger act the company has a bank secrecy act and usa patriot act bodapproved compliance program and engages in relatively few transactions with foreign financial institutions or foreign persons the fcras red flags rule requires financial institutions

future legislative initiatives federal and state legislatures may introduce legislation that will impact the financial services industry in addition federal banking agencies may introduce regulatory initiatives that are likely to impact the financial services industry generally however it is not clear whether such changes will be enacted or if enacted what their effect on the company will be new legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the company in substantial and unpredictable ways if enacted such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks savings associations credit unions and other financial institutions the company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted and if enacted the effect it or any implementing regulations would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the company a change in statutes
