item risk factors item risk factors of the companys annual report on form 10k for the year ended december includes a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and impact our results of operations or financial condition the information presented below updates and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors and information disclosed in the annual report on form 10k the covid19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions have adversely impacted our business and results and could have a more material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations the ongoing covid19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the united states and international economies and financial markets the spread of covid19 in the united states has caused illness quarantines cancellation of events and travel business and school shutdowns reduction in commercial activity and financial transactions supply chain interruptions increased unemployment and overall economic and financial market instability many states including arizona where we are headquartered and california and nevada in which we have significant operations declared states of emergency these states like many others subsequently moved to a phased reopening but continue to be significantly impacted by the pandemic although the bank has continued operating the covid19 pandemic has caused disruptions to our business and could cause material disruptions to our business and operations in the future impacts to our business have included the transition of a significant portion of our workforce to home locations increases in costs due to additional health and safety precautions implemented at our branches and an increase in draws on unfunded loan commitments and requests for forbearance and loan modifications to the extent that commercial and social restrictions remain in place or increase our expenses delinquencies foreclosures and credit losses may materially increase in addition the unprecedented nature of covid19 related disruptions heighten the inherent uncertainty of forecasting future economic conditions and their impact on our loan portfolio and therefore increases the risk that the assumptions judgments and estimates used to determine the appropriate allowance for future credit losses may prove to be incorrect resulting in actual credit losses that exceed the companys recorded allowance unfavorable economic conditions also may make it more difficult for us to maintain deposit levels and loan origination volume and to obtain additional financing furthermore such conditions have and may continue to adversely impact accounting estimates that we use to determine our allowance and provision for credit losses such conditions also could impact the value of assets we carry on our balance sheet such as goodwill and cause the value of collateral associated with our existing loans to decline further certain debt and equity instruments may experience significant fluctuations in value due to market disruption widening of credit spreads and governmental purchase intervention in addition in march the federal reserve lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to a range from to percent in part as a result of the pandemic sudden or unexpectedly large changes in interest rates could impact our ability to effectively manage our interest rate risk and could result in maturity imbalances in our assets and liabilities a prolonged period of very low interest rates or an increase in interest rates that affects our borrowers ability to repay loans could reduce our net interest income and have a material adverse impact on our cash flows while we have taken and are continuing to take actions to protect the safety and wellbeing of our employees and customers no assurance can be given that the steps being taken will be deemed to be adequate or appropriate nor can we predict the level of disruption which will occur to our employees ability to perform their jobs or provide customer support and service the continued or renewed spread of covid19 could negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business the business and operations of our thirdparty service providers who perform critical services for our business or the businesses of many of our customers and borrowers a sizable percentage of our workforce has returned to working in our office buildings and it is possible that one or more members of our senior management or other key employees contracts the virus and is unable to perform their essential duties at the same time many of our employees and employees of companies we do business with continue to work remotely as a result of the pandemic and the risk of cyberattacks breaches or similar events whether through our systems or those of third parties on which we rely therefore has increased among the factors outside our control that are likely to affect the impact the covid19 pandemic will ultimately have on our business are the pandemics course and severity the direct and indirect results of the pandemic such as recessionary economic trends including with respect to employment wages and benefits commercial activity consumer spending and real estate market values political legal and regulatory actions and policies in response to the pandemic including the effects of restrictions on commerce and banking such as moratoria and other suspensions of collections foreclosures and related obligations the timing magnitude and effect of public spending directly or through subsidies its direct and indirect effects on commercial activity and incentives of employers and individuals to resume or increase employment wages and benefits and commercial activity the timing and availability of direct and indirect governmental support for various financial assets including mortgage loans the potential longterm impact on the tourism and hospitality industries which could affect our hotel franchise finance business and portfolio the longterm effect of the economic downturn on our intangible assets such as our deferred tax asset and goodwill potential longerterm effects of increased government spending on the interest rate environment and borrowing costs for nongovernmental parties the ability of our employees and our thirdparty vendors to work effectively during the course of the pandemic potential longerterm shifts toward mobile banking telecommuting and telecommerce and geographic variation in the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic including in states in which we operate physically such as arizona california and nevada the ongoing covid19 pandemic has resulted in severe volatility in the financial markets and meaningfully lower stock prices for many companies including our common stock depending on the extent and duration of the covid19 pandemic the price of our common stock may continue to experience volatility and declines the company is a participating lender in the ppp a loan program administered through the sba that was created to help eligible businesses organizations and selfemployed persons fund their operational costs during the covid19 pandemic under this program the sba guarantees of the amounts loaned under the ppp the ppp opened on april however because of the short window between the passing of the cares act and the opening of the ppp there is some ambiguity in the laws rules and guidance regarding the requirements and operation of the ppp which exposes the company to risks relating to noncompliance with the ppp for instance other financial institutions have experienced litigation related to their policies and procedures for accepting and processing applications for the ppp any financial liability litigation costs or reputational damage caused by ppp related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition the company may be exposed to credit risk on a ppp loan if a determination is made by the sba that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated funded or serviced in such a case the sba may deny its liability under the guaranty reduce the amount of the guaranty or if it has already paid under the guaranty seek recovery of any related loss from the company we are continuing to monitor the covid19 pandemic and related risks although the rapid development and fluidity of the situation precludes any specific prediction as to its ultimate impact on us however if the pandemic continues to spread or otherwise results in a continuation or worsening of the current economic and commercial environments our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios could be materially adversely affected
