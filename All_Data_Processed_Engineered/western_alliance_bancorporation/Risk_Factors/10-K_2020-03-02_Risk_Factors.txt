item risk factors table end investing in the companys common stock involves various risks many of which are specific to the companys business the discussion below addresses the material risks and uncertainties of which the company is currently aware that could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial condition other risks that the company does not know about now or that the company does not currently believe are significant could negatively impact the companys business or the trading price of the companys securities see additional discussions about credit interest rate market and litigation risks in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks relating to the companys business the companys financial performance may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally the companys financial performance is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the company operates and in the us as a whole unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth business activity or investor or business confidence limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital increases in inflation or interest rates government shutdowns the imposition of tariffs on trade natural disasters the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics terrorist attacks acts of war or a combination of these or other factors the specific impact on the company of many of these factors is difficult to predict could be long or short term and may be indirect such as disruptions in our customers supply chain or a reduction in the demand for their products or services a worsening of business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which the company conducts business could have adverse effects including the following table start a decrease in deposit balances or the demand for loans and other products and services the company offers table endtable start an increase in the number of borrowers who become delinquent file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the company which could lead to higher levels of nonperforming assets net chargeoffs and provisions for credit losses table endtable start a decrease in the value of loans and other assets or in the value of collateral table endtable start a decrease in net interest income from the companys lending and deposit gathering activities table endtable start an impairment of certain intangible assets such as goodwill and table endtable start an increase in competition resulting from increasing consolidation within the financial services industry table end in the us financial services industry the commercial soundness of financial institutions is closely interrelated as a result of credit trading clearing or other relationships between the institutions as a result concerns about or a default or threatened default by one institution could lead to significant marketwide liquidity and credit problems losses or defaults by other institutions this is sometimes referred to as systemic risk and may adversely affect financial intermediaries such as clearing agencies clearing houses banks securities firms and exchanges with which the company interacts on a daily basis and therefore could adversely affect the company it is possible that the business environment in the us will experience volatility in the future there can be no assurance that these conditions will improve in the near term or that conditions will not worsen such conditions could adversely affect the companys business results of operations and financial condition the company is highly dependent on real estate and events that negatively impact the real estate market will hurt the companys business and earnings the company is located in areas in which economic growth is largely dependent on the real estate market and a majority of the companys loan portfolio is secured by or otherwise dependent on real estate the market for real estate is cyclical and the outlook for this sector is uncertain a decline in real estate activity would likely cause a decline in asset and deposit growth and negatively impact the companys earnings and financial condition the companys loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial and industrial and cre loans which contain concentrations in certain business lines or product types that have unique risk characteristics and may expose the company to increased lending risks the companys loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial and industrial and cre loans which contain material concentrations in certain business lines or product types such as mortgage warehouse real estate corporate finance municipal and nonprofit loans as well as in specific business sectors such as technology and innovation these loan concentrations present unique risks and involve specialized underwriting and management as they often involve large loan balances to a single borrower or group of related borrowers consequently an adverse development with respect to one commercial loan or one credit relationship may adversely affect the company in addition based on the nature of lending to these specialty markets repayment of loans may be dependent upon borrowers receiving additional equity financing or in some cases a successful sale to a third party public offering or other form of liquidity event unforeseen adverse events changes in regulatory policy or a general decline in the borrowers industry may have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operations due to the inherent risk associated with accounting estimates the companys allowance for credit losses may be insufficient which could require the company to raise additional capital or otherwise adversely affect the companys financial condition and results of operations credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the companys consolidated loan portfolio and maintains an allowance for estimated credit losses based on a number of factors including the size of the portfolio asset classifications economic trends industry experience and trends industry and geographic concentrations estimated collateral values managements assessment of the credit risk inherent in the portfolio historical loan loss experience and loan underwriting policies in addition the company evaluates all loans identified as problem loans and augments the allowance based upon its estimation of the potential loss associated with those problem loans additions to the allowance for credit losses recorded through the companys provision for credit losses decrease the companys net income if such assumptions and judgments are incorrect the companys actual credit losses may exceed the companys allowance for credit losses at december the companys allowance for credit losses and loss contingency on unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit is million and million respectively deterioration in the real estate market or general economic conditions could affect the ability of the companys loan customers to service their debt which could result in additional loan provisions and increases in the companys allowance for credit losses in addition the company may be required to record additional loan provisions or increase the companys allowance for credit losses based on new information regarding existing loans input from regulators in connection with their review of the companys allowance changes in regulatory guidance regulations or accounting standards identification of additional problem loans changes in economic outlook and other factors both within and outside of the companys managements control moreover because future events are uncertain and because the company may not successfully identify all deteriorating loans in a timely manner there may be loans that deteriorate in an accelerated time frame any increases in the provision or allowance for credit losses will result in a decrease in the companys net income and potentially capital and may have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and results of operations if actual credit losses materially exceed the companys allowance for credit losses the company may be required to raise additional capital which may not be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all the companys inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could materially and adversely affect the companys financial condition results of operations and capital recent changes to the fasb accounting standards will result in a significant change to the companys recognition of credit losses and may materially impact the companys financial condition or results of operations the incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses was replaced with an expected loss model referred to as cecl which became effective on january and will be reported in the companys first quarter financial results under the incurred loss model the company delays recognition of losses until it is probable that a loss has been incurred the cecl model represents a dramatic departure from the incurred loss model the cecl model requires the company to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost such as loans held for investment and heldtomaturity debt securities at the net amount expected to be collected additionally the measurement of expected credit losses will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet with periodic updates thereafter and will be based on current conditions information about past events including historical experience and reasonable and supportable forecasts that impact the collectability of the reported amount as such the cecl model will materially impact how the company determines its acl and the companys acl may experience more fluctuations under the cecl model which may result in significant volatility in the provision for credit losses and therefore earnings upon transition from the incurred loss model to the cecl model on january the company recognized an increase to its allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded loan commitments of million and million respectively and established an allowance of million on its htm securities these increases resulted in a onetime cumulative adjustment to retained earnings of million which is net of related tax effects the company could be subject to tax audits challenges to its tax positions or adverse changes or interpretations of tax laws the company is subject to federal and applicable state income tax laws and regulations income tax laws and regulations are often complex and require significant judgment in determining the companys effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions the companys determination of its tax liability is subject to review by applicable tax authorities any audits or challenges of such determinations may adversely affect the companys effective tax rate tax payments or financial condition us tax legislation enacted in late made significant changes to federal tax law including the taxation of corporations by among other things reducing the corporate income tax rate disallowing certain deductions that had previously been allowed and altering the expensing of capital expenditures further changes in tax laws changes in interpretations guidance or regulations that may be promulgated or challenges to judgments or actions that the company may take with respect to tax laws could negatively impact the companys business because of the geographic concentration of the companys assets changes in local economic conditions could adversely affect the companys business and results of operations the companys business is primarily concentrated in selected markets in arizona california and nevada as a result of this geographic concentration the companys financial condition and results of operations depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas deterioration in economic conditions in these markets could result in one or more of the following an increase in loan delinquencies and chargeoffs an increase in problem assets and foreclosures a decrease in the demand for the companys products and services or a decrease in the value of collateral for loans especially real estate the companys financial instruments expose the company to certain market risks and may increase the volatility of earnings and aoci the company holds certain financial instruments measured at fair value for those financial instruments measured at fair value the company is required to recognize the changes in the fair value of such instruments in earnings or aoci each quarter therefore any increases or decreases in the fair value of these financial instruments have a corresponding impact on reported earnings or aoci fair value can be affected by a variety of factors many of which are beyond the companys control including the companys credit position interest rate volatility capital markets volatility and other economic factors accordingly the company is subject to marktomarket risk and the application of fair value accounting may cause the companys earnings and aoci to be more volatile than would be suggested by the companys underlying performance if the company loses a significant portion of its core deposits or a significant deposit relationship or its cost of funding deposits increases significantly the companys liquidity andor profitability would be adversely impacted the companys success depends on its ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund its current obligations and support loan growth and specifically to attract and retain a stable base of relatively lowcost deposits the competition for these deposits in the companys markets is strong and customers may demand higher interest rates on their deposits or seek other investments offering higher rates of return the company offers reciprocal deposit products through third party networks to customers seeking federal insurance for deposit amounts that exceed the applicable deposit insurance limit at a single institution the company also from time to time offers other credit enhancements to depositors such as fhlb letters of credit and for certain deposits of public monies pledges of collateral in the form of readily marketable securities any event or circumstance that interferes with or limits the companys ability to offer these products to customers that require greater security for their deposits such as a significant regulatory enforcement action or a significant decline in capital levels at the companys bank subsidiary could negatively impact the companys ability to attract and retain deposits if the company were to lose a significant deposit relationship or a significant portion of its lowcost deposits the company would be required to borrow from other sources at higher rates and the companys liquidity and profitability would be adversely impacted from time to time the company has utilized borrowings from the fhlb and the frb and there can be no assurance these programs will be available as needed as of december the company has no borrowings from the fhlb of san francisco or the frb however in the past the company has utilized borrowings from the fhlb of san francisco and the frb to satisfy its shortterm liquidity needs the companys borrowing capacity is generally dependent on the value of its collateral pledged to these entities these lenders could reduce the companys borrowing capacity or eliminate certain types of collateral and could otherwise modify or even terminate their loan programs any change or termination could have an adverse effect on the companys liquidity and profitability the companys business may be adversely affected by fraud as a financial institution the company is inherently exposed to a wide range of operational risks including but not limited to theft and other fraudulent activity by employees customers and other third parties targeting the company andor the companys customers or data such activity may take many forms including check fraud electronic fraud wire fraud phishing social engineering and other dishonest acts although the company devotes substantial resources to maintaining effective policies and internal controls to identify and prevent such incidents given the persistence and increasing sophistication of possible perpetrators the company may experience financial losses or reputational harm as a result of fraud a failure in or breach of the companys operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of the companys thirdparty vendors and other service providers including as a result of cyberattacks could disrupt the companys businesses result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information damage the companys reputation increase the companys costs and cause losses the companys operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information although the company takes numerous protective measures to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of the companys and its customers information across all geographies and product lines and endeavors to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant the nature of the threats continues to evolve as a result the companys computer systems software and networks and those of the companys customers and thirdparty vendors may be vulnerable to unauthorized payments and account access loss or destruction of data including confidential client information account takeovers unavailability of service computer viruses or other malicious code cyberattacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact and result in significant losses to the company andor its customers these threats may originate externally from increasingly sophisticated third parties including foreign governments organized criminal groups and other hackers or from outsourced or infrastructuresupport providers and application developers or the threats may originate from within the companys organization the company also faces the risk of operational disruption failure termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate the companys business activities including vendors exchanges clearing agents clearing houses or other financial intermediaries such parties could also be the source or cause of an attack on or breach of the companys operational systems data or infrastructure in addition the company may be at risk of an operational failure with respect to its customers systems the companys risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of among other things the evolving nature of these threats the outsourcing of many of the companys business operations and the continued uncertain global economic environment as cyber threats continue to evolve the company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities the company maintains insurance policies that it believes provide reasonable coverage at a manageable expense for an institution of the companys size and scope with similar technological systems however the company cannot assure that these policies will afford coverage for all possible losses or would be sufficient to cover all financial losses damages or penalties including lost revenues should the company experience any one or more of its or a third partys systems failing or experiencing an attack the company relies on third parties to provide key components of its business infrastructure the company relies on third parties to provide key components for its business operations such as data processing and storage recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services internet connections and network access while the company selects these thirdparty vendors carefully it does not control their actions any problems caused by these third parties including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes cyberattacks and security breaches at a vendor failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance by a vendor could adversely affect the companys ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business financial or operational difficulties of a thirdparty vendor could also hurt the companys operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendors ability to serve the company replacing these thirdparty vendors also could create significant delays and expense any of these things could adversely affect the companys business and financial performance a change in the companys creditworthiness could increase the companys cost of funding or adversely affect its liquidity market participants regularly evaluate the companys creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of the companys longterm debt based on a number of factors some of which are not entirely within the companys control including the companys financial strength and conditions within the financial services industry generally there can be no assurance that the companys perceived creditworthiness will remain the same changes could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which the company is able to obtain funding and its access to the capital markets and could increase the companys cost of capital likewise any loss of or decline in the credit rating assigned to wab could impair its ability to attract deposits or to obtain other funding sources or increase its cost of funding the companys controls and processes its reporting systems and procedures and its operational infrastructure may not be able to keep pace with its growth which could cause it to experience compliance and operational problems or lose customers or incur additional expenditures beyond current projections any one of which could adversely affect the companys financial results the companys future success will depend on the ability of officers and other key employees to effectively implement solutions designed to improve operational credit financial management and other internal risk controls and processes as well as improve reporting systems and procedures while at the same time maintaining and growing existing businesses and client relationships the company may not successfully implement such changes or improvements in an efficient or timely manner or it may discover deficiencies in its existing systems and controls that adversely affect the companys ability to support and grow its existing businesses and client relationships and could require the company to incur additional expenditures to expand its administrative and operational infrastructure if the company is unable to maintain and implement improvements to its controls processes and reporting systems and procedures the company may lose customers experience compliance and operational problems or incur additional expenditures beyond current projections any one of which could adversely affect the companys financial results the companys expansion strategy may not prove to be successful and its market value and profitability may suffer the company continually evaluates expansion through acquisitions of banks and other financial assets and businesses like previous acquisitions by the company any future acquisitions will be accompanied by risks commonly encountered in such transactions including among other things table start time and expense incurred while identifying evaluating and negotiating potential acquisitions and transactions table endtable start difficulty in accurately estimating the value of target companies or assets and in evaluating target companies or assets credit operations management and market risks table endtable start potential payment of a premium over book and market values that may cause dilution of the companys tangible book value or earnings per share table endtable start exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company table endtable start potential exposure to asset quality issues of the target company table endtable start difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel table endtable start potential disruption of the companys ongoing business table endtable start failure to retain key personnel at the acquired business table endtable start inability of the companys management to maximize its financial and strategic position by the successful implementation of uniform product offerings and the incorporation of uniform technology into the companys product offerings and control systems and table endtable start failure to realize any expected revenue increases cost savings and other projected benefits from an acquisition table end the company expects that competition for suitable acquisition candidates may be significant the company may compete with other banks or financial service companies with similar acquisition strategies many of which are larger and have greater financial and other resources the company cannot assure that it will be able to successfully identify and acquire suitable acquisition targets on acceptable terms and conditions or that it will be able to obtain the regulatory approvals needed to complete any such transactions the company cannot provide any assurance that it will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with acquisitions potential regulatory enforcement actions could also adversely affect the companys ability to engage in certain acquisition activities the companys inability to overcome the risks inherent in the successful completion and integration of acquisitions could have an adverse effect on the achievement of the companys business strategy there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with the introduction or expansion of lines of business or new products and services within existing lines of business from time to time the company may implement new lines of business offer new products and services within existing lines of business or offer existing products or services to new industries or market segments there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed or industries are heavily regulated in developing and marketing new lines of business andor new products and services the company may invest significant time and resources initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business andor new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove attainable external factors such as compliance with laws and regulations competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences or government policies may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business product or service or the offering of existing products and services to an emerging industry furthermore any new line of business andor new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the companys system of internal controls failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial condition the companys future success depends on its ability to compete effectively in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market the company faces substantial competition in all phases of its operations from a variety of different competitors the companys competitors including large commercial banks community banks thrift institutions mutual savings banks credit unions finance companies insurance companies securities dealers brokers mortgage bankers investment advisors money market mutual funds and other financial institutions compete with lending and depositgathering services offered by the company increased competition in the companys markets may result in reduced loans and deposits or less favorable pricing there is competition for financial services in the markets in which the company conduct its businesses including from many local commercial banks as well as numerous national and regionally based commercial banks in particular the company has experienced intense price and terms competition in some of the lending lines of business and deposits in recent years many of these competing institutions have much greater financial and marketing resources than the company has due to their size larger competitors can achieve economies of scale and may offer a broader range of products and services or more attractive pricing than the company in addition some of the financial services organizations with which the company competes are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured depository institutions as a result these nonbank competitors have certain advantages over the company in accessing funding and in providing various services the banking business in the companys primary market areas is very competitive and the level of competition facing the company may increase further which may limit its asset growth and financial results in particular the companys predominate source of revenue is net interest income from its loan portfolio therefore if the company is unable to compete effectively including sustaining loan and deposit growth at its historical levels its business and results of operations may be adversely affected the financial services industry also is facing increasing competitive pressure from the introduction of disruptive new technologies often by nontraditional competitors and financial technology companies among other things technology and other changes are allowing customers to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks at one or both ends of the transaction the elimination of banks as intermediaries for certain transactions as well as further disruption of traditional bank businesses and products by nonbanks could result in the loss of fee income and deposits and otherwise adversely affect our business and results the companys success is dependent upon its ability to recruit and retain qualified employees including members of its divisional and business line leadership and management teams the companys business plan includes and is dependent upon hiring and retaining highly qualified and motivated executives and employees at every level in particular the companys relative success to date has been partly the result of its managements ability to identify and retain highly qualified employees in administrative support roles as well as those with expertise in certain specialty areas or that have longstanding relationships in their communities or markets these professionals bring with them valuable knowledge specialized skills and expertise and customer relationships and have been an integral part of the companys ability to attract deposits and to expand its market share additionally as part of the companys strategy the company depends on divisional and business line leadership and management teams in each of its significant geographic locations in addition to their skills and experience as bankers these persons provide the company with extensive ties within markets upon which the companys competitive strategy is based the companys ability to retain these highly qualified and motivated persons may be hindered by the fact that it has not entered into employment agreements with most of them the company incentivizes employee retention through its equity incentive plans however the company cannot guarantee the effectiveness of its equity incentive plans in retaining these key employees and executives were the company to lose key employees it may not be able to replace them with equally qualified persons who bring the same knowledge of and ties to the communities and markets within which the company operates if the company is unable to hire or retain qualified employees it may not be able to successfully execute its business strategy or may incur additional costs to achieve its objectives the company could be harmed if its succession planning is inadequate to mitigate the loss of key members of its senior management team the company believes that its senior management team including but not limited to robert sarver its executive chairman and kenneth vecchione its ceo have contributed greatly to its performance in addition the company from time to time experiences retirements and other changes to its senior management team the companys future performance depends on a smooth transition of its senior management including finding and training highly qualified replacements who are properly equipped to lead the company the company has adopted retention strategies including equity awards from which its senior management team benefits in order to achieve its goals and entered into an employment agreement with mr vecchione which expires in however the company cannot assure its succession planning and retention strategies will be effective and the loss of senior management could have an adverse effect on the companys business the companys risk management practices may prove to be inadequate or not fully effective the companys risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return the company has established policies and procedures intended to identify monitor and manage the types of risk to which it is subject including but not limited to credit risk market risk liquidity risk operational risk legal and compliance risk and reputational risk a bod level risk committee approves and reviews the companys key risk management policies and oversees operation of the companys risk management framework although the company has devoted significant resources to developing its risk management policies and procedures and expects to continue to do so in the future these policies and procedures as well as the companys risk management techniques may not be fully effective in addition as regulations and the markets in which the company operates continue to evolve the companys risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes if the companys risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate its risks the company could suffer unexpected losses or other material adverse impact management of the companys risks in some cases depends upon the use of analytical andor forecasting models if the models the company uses to mitigate these risks are inadequate or are subject to ineffective governance the company may incur increased losses in addition there may be risks that exist or that develop in the future that the company has not appropriately anticipated identified or mitigated the companys internal controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented and the accuracy of the companys judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters may impact operating results and financial condition the companys management regularly reviews and updates its internal controls over financial reporting disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls and procedures however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of the companys controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could result in materially inaccurate reported financial statements andor have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial condition similarly the companys management makes certain estimates and judgments in preparing the companys financial statements the quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will impact the companys operating results and financial condition if the company is unable to understand and adapt to technological change the companys business could be adversely affected the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services the effective use of technology can increase efficiency and enable financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs however some new technologies needed to compete effectively result in incremental operating costs the companys future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations many of the companys competitors because of their larger size and available capital have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements the company may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the companys business and in turn its financial condition and results of operations the markets in which the company operates are subject to the risk of both natural and manmade disasters many of the real and personal properties securing the companys loans are located in california much of california experiences wildfires from time to time that cause significant damage throughout the state while these wildfires did not significantly damage the companys own properties it is possible that its borrowers may experience losses as a result which may materially impair their ability to meet the terms of their obligations california is also prone to other natural disasters including but not limited to drought earthquakes flooding and mudslides additional significant natural or manmade disasters in the state of california or in the companys other markets could lead to damage or injury to the companys own properties andor employees and could increase the risk that many of its borrowers may experience losses or sustained job interruption which may materially impair their ability to maintain deposits or meet the terms of their loan obligations therefore additional natural disasters a manmade disaster or a catastrophic event or a combination of these or other factors in any of the companys markets could have a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition results of operations and cash flows risks related to the banking industry the company operates in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern the companys operations corporate governance executive compensation and accounting principles or changes in them or the companys failure to comply with them may adversely affect the company the company is subject to extensive regulation supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of its operations intended to protect customers depositors and the dif these laws and regulations among other matters prescribe minimum capital requirements impose limitations on the business activities in which the company can engage require monitoring and reporting of suspicious activity and of customers who are perceived to present a heightened risk of money laundering or other illegal activity limit the dividends or distributions that wab can pay to the company or that the company can pay to its stockholders restrict the ability of affiliates to guarantee the companys debt impose certain specific accounting requirements on the company that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in the companys capital than does gaap among other things compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly and changes to laws and regulations often impose significant additional compliance costs to the extent the company continues to grow larger and become more complex regulatory oversight and risk and the cost of compliance will likely increase which may adversely affect the company see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations supervision and regulation included in this form 10k for a more detailed summary of the regulations and supervision to which the company are subject changes to the legal and regulatory framework governing the companys operations including the passage and continued implementation of the doddfrank act and egrrcpa have drastically revised the laws and regulations under which the company operates in general bank regulators have increased their focus on risk management and regulatory compliance and the company expects this focus to continue additional compliance requirements may be costly to implement may require additional compliance personnel and may limit the companys ability to offer competitive products to its customers the company is also subject to changes in federal and state law as well as regulations and governmental policies income tax laws and accounting principles regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions are undergoing continuous review and frequently change and the ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted regulations and laws may be modified at any time and new legislation may be enacted that will affect the company wab and the companys other subsidiaries any changes in federal and state law as well as regulations and governmental policies income tax laws and accounting principles could affect the company in substantial and unpredictable ways including ways that may adversely affect the companys business financial condition or results of operations failure to appropriately comply with any such laws regulations or principles or an alleged failure to comply even if the company acted in good faith or the alleged failure reflects a difference in interpretation could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties or damage to the companys reputation all of which could adversely affect the companys business financial condition or results of operations state and federal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of the companys business including compliance with laws and regulations and the companys failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which the company is or becomes subject as a result of such examinations may adversely affect the company state and federal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of the companys business including for compliance with laws and regulations if as a result of an examination an agency were to determine that the financial condition capital resources asset quality earnings prospects management liquidity or other aspects of any of the companys operations had become unsatisfactory or that the company or its management was in violation of any law or regulation federal banking agencies may take a number of different remedial or enforcement actions it deems appropriate to remedy such a deficiency these actions include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced to direct an increase in the companys capital to restrict the companys growth and to assess civil monetary penalties against the company andor officers or directors and to remove officers and directors if the fdic concludes that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors it may terminate wabs deposit insurance under arizona law the state banking supervisory authority has many of the same enforcement powers with respect to its statechartered banks finally the cfpb has the authority to examine the company and has authority to take enforcement actions including the issuance of ceaseanddesist orders or civil monetary penalties against the company if it finds that the company offers consumer financial products and services in violation of federal consumer financial protection laws or in an unfair deceptive or abusive manner if the company were unable to comply with regulatory directives in the future or if the company were unable to comply with the terms of any future supervisory requirements to which the company may become subject then it could become subject to a variety of supervisory actions and orders including cease and desist orders prompt corrective actions mous andor other regulatory enforcement actions if the companys regulators were to take such supervisory actions then the company could among other things become subject to restrictions on its ability to enter into acquisitions and develop any new business as well as restrictions on its existing business the company also could be required to raise additional capital dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time or both failure to implement the measures in the time frames provided or at all could result in additional orders or penalties from federal and state regulators which could result in one or more of the remedial actions described above in the event the company was ultimately unable to comply with the terms of a regulatory enforcement action it could fail and be placed into receivership by the fdic or the chartering agency the terms of any such supervisory action and the consequences associated with any failure to comply therewith could have a material negative effect on the companys business operating flexibility and financial condition uncertainty about the future of libor and its accepted alternatives may adversely affect our business the united kingdom financial conduct authority the agency that regulates libor has announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after which may result in the use of libor in financial contracts being phased out by the end of the arrc has proposed that the sofr represents best practice as the alternative to libor for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to libor arrc has proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from libor and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to libor it is not possible at this time to predict what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for liborindexed financial instruments the market transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate such as the sofr is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our loan and lease and investment portfolios assetliability management business financial condition and results of operations libor is the reference rate for many transactions in which the company lends and borrows money issues purchases and sells securities and enters into derivative contracts to manage its or its customers risk related to these transactions accordingly management has established a libor transition team to lead the company in the execution of its project plan despite these efforts the manner and impact of this transition and related developments as well as the effect of these developments on the companys funding costs investment and trading securities portfolios and business is uncertain and could have a
