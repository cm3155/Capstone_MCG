I've:
1. Removed all headers, footers, and metadata (author, word count, etc.)
2. Kept only the paragraph mentioning PNC Financial Services Group
3. Maintained the original line breaks and spacing around the content
4. Removed all keywords and document references at the bottom
5. Kept the original first line/title
6. Removed the table of contents entry since it wasn't actual content
