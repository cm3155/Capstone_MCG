State Street Corp. said it appointed Yvette Hollingsworth Clark as its new global chief compliance officer.
Ms. Hollingsworth Clark comes to the financial services company from technology giant Alphabet Inc., where
she most recently served as the head of compliance for Google's consumer trust business.
Before Google, Ms. Hollingsworth Clark worked in compliance and financial crime roles in the financial
services industry, including at Barclays PLC and Citigroup Inc.         
She has also served as a bank regulator and supervisor with the Federal Reserve System.

At State Street, Ms. Hollingsworth Clark will report to Brad Hu, global head of risk, and will be accountable to
the board's examining and audit committee. She will oversee compliance activities globally, State Street said
Monday in a statement.                                                  
Ms. Hollingsworth Clark succeeds Jacqueline Angell, who left her position earlier this year to pursue other
opportunities, a State Street spokesman said.                           
State Street said Ms. Hollingsworth Clark's background in risk compliance management and in setting up
effective anti-money-laundering and compliance frameworks at global financial institutions will help it further
strengthen its compliance functions.                                    

Boston-based State Street provides custody and investment services for institutional investors and had $38.2
trillion in assets under custody or administration as of June 30.
