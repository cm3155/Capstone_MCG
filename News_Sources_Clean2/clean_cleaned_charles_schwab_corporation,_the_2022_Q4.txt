At Charles Schwab Corp., the parent of TD Ameritrade, Jeff Starr, a managing director, said, "When you see
the sort of execution quality that we're getting, it's really hard to say that payment for order flow is a problem."

Executives at brokerages and market-makers have questioned the methodology of the BestEx paper.
Schwab said it got midpoint executions or better on 52% of its customers' market orders last year.

"There has been a secular trend in the last two decades toward an improved retail trading experience," said
Jason Clague, a managing director at Schwab. "What we're struggling to understand from Chair Gensler and
his staff is why they feel the market is broken, despite a wealth of evidence to the contrary."
