          Stocks pulled back Tuesday in their first trading after a five-week rally carried Wall Street to its highest level
          since the spring of last year.                                          
          The S&P 500 fell 0.5 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.7 percent. The Nasdaq
          composite lost 0.2 percent.                                             
          The stock market took a step back following many steps forward on hopes the economy can avoid a
          recession and inflation is easing enough for the Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates soon. A frenzy
          around artificial intelligence has also vaulted a select group of tech stocks to huge gains.
          Those hopes are battling against worries that stubborn inflation will force the Fed to keep interest rates higher
          for longer, which could grind down the economy. With some of the easiest improvements in year-over-year
          inflation soon to be lapped, a tougher road may be ahead for both the economy and financial markets.
          ''Leaning on the lessons of the 1970s, the Fed is right to be cautious, even if that represents an inconvenient
          truth for stock investors,'' said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.
                                                                                  
          During the '70s, inflation remained high for much longer than hoped, forcing the Fed to ultimately drive the
          economy into a painful recession by sharply raising interest rates.     
          In China, meanwhile, the world's second-largest economy is stumbling in its recovery following the relaxation
          of anti-Covid restrictions.                                             
          Stocks in Hong Kong tumbled 1.5 percent Tuesday after China's central bank cut interest rates by less than
          some investors had hoped. Stocks in Shanghai slipped 0.5 percent amid disappointment Chinese authorities
          didn't do more to support one of the world's main drivers of economic growth.
                                                                                  
          Tuesday was the first trading for Wall Street following a meeting between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and
          Secretary of State Antony Blinken. It yielded no signs of progress from either of the world's largest economies
          on Taiwan, human rights, technology and other issues of contention.     
          Most of Wall Street fell, with four out of five stocks in the S&P 500 lower.
          Worries about the global economy's strength dragged down prices for crude oil and stocks of companies that
          pull it from the ground. Energy stocks fell 2.3 percent for the largest loss among the 11 sectors that make up
          the S&P 500. Exxon Mobil fell 2.3 percent, and Chevron lost 2.3 percent.
          Ball Corp., which makes aluminum cans and other products, dropped 4.2 percent. It said Tuesday that it was
          considering options for its aerospace business but that ''there is no certainty that any formal decision will be
          made.'' Its stock had jumped 7.2 percent Friday following a report that it was looking to sell the unit.
                                                                                  
          On the winning side was Dice Therapeutics, which soared 37.2 percent after Eli Lilly said it would buy the
          biopharmaceutical company for $2.4 billion in cash. Lilly added 0.9 percent.
