          The reservoir at the Kakhovka dam near the Ukrainian town of Nova Kakhovka contained about 18 billion
          cubic meters of water. A Page One article on Wednesday about the dam's destruction incorrectly gave the
          figure as about 18 million cubic meters.

          Stocks fell on Wall Street Tuesday after reports on the economy came in weaker than expected.
          The S&P 500 dropped 0.6 percent to break a four-day winning streak. The Dow Jones industrial average fell
          0.6 percent and the Nasdaq composite sank 0.5 percent.                  
          Investors are still split on whether the U.S. economy will fall into a recession and how badly corporate profits
          are set to drop. The biggest question remains what the Federal Reserve will do next with interest rates after
          raising them furiously over the last year to get high inflation under control.
          The reports on job openings and factory orders released Tuesday may have heightened recession fears. But
          they may also give the Fed reason to hold rates steady at its next meeting, for the first time in more than a
          year, offering a possible upside for markets.                           
          One report showed employers advertised 9.9 million job openings in February, a sharper falloff than
          economists expected. A separate report showed that factory orders weakened in February more than
          economists expected.                                                    
                                                                                  
          ''It's all suggesting that the economy is slowing down, which was the Fed's intent all along in terms of raising
          rates,'' said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for SPDR business at State Street Global Advisors.
          Some relatively encouraging data on inflation came in from other parts of the world on Tuesday.
                                                                                  
          In Europe, a survey by the European Central Bank showed expectations for inflation in the coming year was
          falling among consumers in the region. Lower expectations can help the economy avoid a vicious cycle
          where inflation keeps building momentum.                                
          A separate report also showed that inflation at the wholesale level in the region slowed by more in February
          than economists expected.                                               
          In Australia, the country's central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged at 3.6 percent. It said it wanted
          time to see how its past increases were working through the system.     
          While Australia's economy is much smaller than that of the U.S. or European Union, its central bank and that
          of New Zealand tend to ''set the tone for monetary policy cycles,'' Ipek Ozkardeskaya of Swissquote.com said
          in a commentary.                                                        
                                                                                  
          In the United States, traders flipped bets back toward the Fed holding steady on rates at its meeting next
          month. A day earlier, a slight majority was betting on another increase in rates. That helped lower yields in
          the bond market.                                                        
          The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 3.33 percent from 3.42 percent late Monday. The two-year Treasury,
          which moves more on expectations for the Fed, dropped to 3.82 percent from 3.97 percent.
          Longer term, there seems to be more confidence on Wall Street that the Fed will have to cut rates later this
          year.                                                                   
                                                                                  
          That has helped to buoy stocks, particularly technology and other high-growth companies, because rate cuts
          tend to act like steroids for markets. But the Fed has been consistent in saying it does not expect any rate
          cuts this year.

          On Wall Street, shares of Virgin Orbit plunged 23.2 percent to 15 cents after the company filed for Chapter 11
          bankruptcy protection. It has been contending with the fallout of a failed mission this year and increasing
          difficulty in raising funding for future missions.                      
          Stocks in industries whose profits are closely tied to the strength of the economy, such as industrial and
          energy companies, fell more than the rest of the market. Valero Energy fell 8 percent for one of the biggest
          losses in the S&P 500.                                                  
          Oil prices swung through the day before adding to their big gains from Monday, when they shot higher on
          worries about tighter supplies. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 29 cents to $80.71 per barrel. Brent crude, the
          international standard, rose a penny to $84.94 per barrel.
