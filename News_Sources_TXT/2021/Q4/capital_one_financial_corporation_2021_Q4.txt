          Capital One Settles Suit Over Data Hack in 2019                         
          Capital One has agreed to pay $190 million to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by customers of the bank
          after a hacker stole the personal data of more than a 100 million people in 2019.
                                                                                  
          The settlement would cover 98 million customers who were affected by the breach, which was one of the
          largest data thefts from a bank. Capital One and its cloud services provider, Amazon Web Services, denied
          liability but said they would settle ''in the interest of avoiding the time, expense and uncertainty of continued
          litigation,'' according to a filing this week in federal court in the Eastern District of Virginia.
          Last year, the bank agreed to pay $80 million to settle regulators' claims that it lacked proper cybersecurity
          procedures as it began to use cloud storage tech.                       
          The hacker, Paige Thompson, left an online trail for investigators to follow as she boasted about the breach,
          according to court documents in Seattle at the time. LANANH NGUYEN

          American Ports to Receive $241 Million in Grants                        
          Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, right, is awarding more than $241 million in grants to bolster
          American ports, part of the Biden administration's near-term plan to address America's clogged supply chain
          with infrastructure improvements to speed the flow of goods.            
                                                                                  
          The transportation money is being made available immediately to 25 projects in 19 states. Next year, the
          amount of money for port improvements will nearly double to $450 million in grants annually for five years
          under President Biden's new infrastructure law.                         
          ''These investments in our nation's ports will help support American jobs, efficient and resilient operations and
          faster delivery of goods to the American people,'' Mr. Buttigieg said on Thursday.
          The grant money includes $52.3 million to help increase rail capacity at the port in Long Beach, Calif., with a
          new locomotive facility, 10,000-foot support track and extensions of five existing tracks to speed up freight
          movement. ASSOCIATED PRESS
