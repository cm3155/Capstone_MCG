          U.S. stocks ticked to more records on Monday ahead of a week with several top-tier reports on inflation due,
          as well as the Federal Reserve's latest meeting on interest rates.      
          The S&P 500 rose 13.80 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,360.79 and topped its high set last week. The Nasdaq
          composite also set a record after rising 59.40, or 0.3 percent, to 17,192.53, while the Dow Jones industrial
          average gained 69.05, or 0.2 percent, to 38,868.04.                     
          Southwest Airlines flew to one of the market's biggest gains, up 7 percent, after Elliott Investment
          Management said it took a $1.9 billion ownership stake in the company.  
          Diamond Offshore Drilling jumped 10.9 percent after Noble agreed to buy its rival in a cash-and-stock deal
          valued at roughly $1.6 billion. Noble added 6.1 percent in a signal that traders expect the combination to be a
          winner. Other energy producers also climbed as the price of crude oil recovered some of its sharp losses
          since the spring.                                                       
          Huntington Bancshares dropped 6.1 percent for one of the market's largest losses after cutting its forecast for
          a key component of profit this year.                                    
          Apple fell 1.9 percent after a highly anticipated conference where it showed how its operating systems will
          use ChatGPT to offer services using artificial-intelligence technology. A furor around A.I. broadly on Wall
          Street has helped send stocks to records despite worries about high interest rates and the slowdown in the
          U.S. economy that they induce.                                          
                                                                                  
          Data on the economy have come in mixed recently, and traders are hoping they will ultimately show a
          slowdown that stops short of a recession and is just right in magnitude. A cool-down would put less upward
          pressure on inflation, which could encourage the Federal Reserve to cut its main interest rate from its most
          punishing level in more than two decades.                               
          But the data have been tough to parse, with Friday's stronger-than-expected jobs report quickly on the heels
          of weaker-than-expected reports on U.S. manufacturing and other areas of the economy. Even within U.S.
          consumer spending, the heart of the economy, is a sharp divide between lower-income households struggling
          to keep up with still-high inflation and higher-income households doing much better.
          ''Bottom line, the data remains mixed, leaving all of the major macro outcomes still on the table for this year,''
          according to Morgan Stanley strategists, led by Michael Wilson.         
          In the meantime, companies benefiting from the A.I. boom are continuing to report big growth almost
          regardless of what the economy and interest rates are doing.            
          Nvidia, for example, is worth roughly $3 trillion and rose 0.7 percent Monday after reversing an early-morning
          loss. It was the first day of trading for the company since a 10-for-one stock split made its share price more
          affordable to investors, after it ballooned to more than $1,000 amid the A.I. frenzy.
          Treasury yields were mixed in the bond market ahead of reports later in the week that will show whether
