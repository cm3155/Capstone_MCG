          NYCB's stock went on a wild ride Wednesday. The Wall Street Journal reported that the troubled regional
          lender was seeking to raise equity capital in a bid to shore up confidence, sending shares down more than
          40% during the session. Amid several trading halts, NYCB said it raised more than $1 billion from a group of
          investors including former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The company also disclosed a sweeping
          overhaul of its management. NYCB shares recovered once trading resumed, ending 7.5% higher
          Wednesday, followed by a 5.8% gain Thursday after NYCB cut its quarterly dividend.

          Rivian hopes to jump-start sales with its new, more affordable electric cars. The electric-vehicle startup
          unveiled two new SUVs on Thursday: the midsize R2, which is slated to go on sale in 2026, and a smaller
          model called the R3. Rivian didn't say when the R3 would go on sale. The R2 resembles a smaller version of
          Rivian's $75,000 R1S SUV, with a lower price tag of $45,000. Rivian reported a $5.4 billion net loss for last
          year, and in February said it would lay off 10% of its salaried workforce. Rivian shares jumped 13% Thursday.

          Kroger bagged more sales in the latest quarter. The supermarket chain on Thursday said sales rose 6% in
          the fourth quarter as customer visits increased. Chief Executive Rodney McMullen told The Wall Street
          Journal that shoppers' attitudes are improving after persistent increases in food costs. The Biden
          administration has criticized grocery companies for price hikes and the Federal Trade Commission sued to
          block Kroger and Albertsons' $25 billion merger, saying the deal would lead to higher prices. Kroger shares
          jumped 9.9% Thursday.

          Target has its eyes set on a turnaround. The retailer on Tuesday posted stronger-than-expected profits in the
          holiday quarter and announced a new paid membership program, Target Circle 360. Target also introduced
          plans to open hundreds of new stores and to invest in improvements to most of its locations over the next

          Spirit and JetBlue Airways have grounded their merger plans for good. The two airlines on Monday said they
          were terminating the $3.8 billion deal, after deciding that they likely couldn't overcome the legal and
          regulatory hurdles in the way of the merger. A judge in January ruled that combining the two airlines would
          reduce competition and harm cost-conscious fliers. The two would have formed the fifth-largest U.S. carrier.
          Spirit shares dropped 11% Monday, while JetBlue shares gained 4.3%.

          Broadcom's giant deal with VMware overshadowed AI appetite in its latest quarter. The chip and software
          maker posted weaker-than-expected quarterly profit due to deal-related costs after closing its acquisition of
          the software company last year. The deal, valued at $69 billion, is one of the largest-ever tech tie-ups. Chief
          Executive Hock Tan gave a stronger outlook for artificial-intelligence chip revenue for the fiscal year.
          Broadcom shares fell 7% Friday.

          Cosmetics giant Estee Lauder said it would lay off up to 5% of its staff, or up to 3,100 workers. The company
          also reported falling profits in the latest quarter. The maker of MAC Cosmetics and Aveda, which has roughly
          62,000 employees, said that it expects to take restructuring and other charges of between $500 million and
          $700 million, and that it would retrain and redeploy some staff. Estee Lauder shares soared 12% Monday.

          Regional lender NYCB on Wednesday named Alessandro DiNello as executive chairman. The move comes
          after NYCB reported a fourth-quarter loss and slashed its dividend to build capital after acquiring Flagstar
          Bank and the failed Signature Bank. DiNello is the former head of Flagstar Bank. Since the report, NYCB
          stock has dropped, reigniting fears of regional bank failures. NYCB executives raced to say the bank is
          sound. NYCB shares gained 6.7% Wednesday.

          Israel's war in Gaza is weighing on McDonald's. Price increases and menu promotions helped boost its U.S.
          sales in the latest quarter, but the conflict in the Middle East hit its international sales. McDonald's has been
          the target of online criticism and boycotts, as the company pushed back against accusations that it has
          favored one side or the other in the conflict. McDonald's shares lost 3.7% Monday.
