          [Financial Analysis and Commentary]                                     
          Scale is crucial in the wealth-management business, but it needs to be the right kind of scale.
          Managing money for the rich is today's golden goose in banking, because it generates stable fees and has
          low capital requirements. Many are eager to ape Morgan Stanley, which has become a wealth mammoth
          following the acquisition of Smith Barney from Citi in 2009, and later Eaton Vance. Its American wealth
          business, which now amounts to $4.6 trillion in client assets, is so large that it yields a 29% pretax profit
          margin, according to estimates by Anke Reingen at RBC Capital Markets.  
          Meanwhile, the U.S. wealth arm of its main global competitor, UBS, has only $2 trillion in client assets and a
          12% margin, even after merging with Credit Suisse last year. Globally, it has $4.3 trillion in assets and a 21%
          margin.                                                                 
          The U.S. is a difficult market for outsiders to penetrate. Top banks have a 48% market share, figures by
          Coalition Greenwich show, compared with a 32% world average. Retaining financial advisers is expensive
          because they are increasingly thriving by going independent.            
          Last week, executives at the Swiss bank told staff that the business will be restructured, and that a new
          division will focus on less-wealthy individuals. Recently, UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher, formerly of Morgan
          Stanley, opened the door to eventually growing through acquisitions.    
          Yet catering to the ultra-rich, the rich and the merely well-off are very different propositions.
                                                                                  
          The financial industry usually places the cutoff between "ultra-high net worth" and "high net worth" or
          "affluent" at $10 million in investible assets. Below that, in the bracket between $100,000 and $1 million, are
          the "mass affluent." According to credit-reporting agency Equifax, 35% of U.S. households count as mass
          affluent, and 10% are above that. But in terms of assets, the mass affluent account for just 27% of investible
          wealth, while the top 10% of the population accounts for 70% of it.     
          Though some mass-market brokers such as Schwab have gone upscale, high net worth remains mostly the
          turf of the likes of Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Citi and UBS. These clients pay big bucks for bespoke,
          one-to-one services.                                                    
          Big banks are particularly well suited to cater to ultra-high-net-worth individuals who have complex needs,
          including complying with cross-border regulations, setting out strategies for their businesses and creating
          charitable foundations.                                                 
          UBS is trying to build a cross-selling point by seeking a broader U.S. banking license that would make it
          easier to extend loans and take deposits.                               
          Still, making larger moves would first require fixing the cost issues of its American wealth arm: At similar size,
          Wells Fargo and Raymond James are more profitable.                      
                                                                                  
          To be fair, the Swiss bank isn't oblivious to this, which is why it is cutting compensation for lower-performing
          financial advisers. Nor is it attempting an in-house version of its failed Wealthfront takeover: The new division
          will still be adviser-led, and only service people with more than $500,000.
