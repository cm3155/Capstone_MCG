          U.S. stocks rose, with the S&P 500, Dow industrials and Nasdaq posting gains of 0.8%, 0.4% and 0.5%,
          respectively.

          Palantir Technologies Inc. and Asana Inc. both completed direct listings on the New York Stock Exchange on
          the same day, a milestone for the little-tested way to go public.       
          But Palantir's debut was mired by technical issues with Morgan Stanley software that prevented some
          existing investors in the company from unloading shares for much of the afternoon, according to people
          familiar with the matter, throwing into question whether there are more sellers waiting in the wings.
          The data-mining company's stock opened for trading at $10 a share around 1:40 p.m. New York time. Once it
          did, current and former employees of Palantir who wanted to sell some of their stake on the open market had
          difficulty doing so, these people said. Palantir employees use Morgan Stanley's stock-plan business, called
          Shareworks, which suffered from technical difficulties Wednesday. The Shareworks platform is used by many
          companies, not just those going public via direct listings.             
          The problems eased late in the day and the system was fully functional by 3:30 p.m. ET, according to a
          person familiar with the matter. Some individuals' sell orders were able to be executed on the platform before
          the close of trading. Others said they struggled to sell their stock through the closing bell and were also
          unable to sell by phone.                                                
          By the time markets closed, Palantir's stock was worth less than it was earlier in the day. The stock closed at
          $9.50, below its high of $11.42 and its first-trade price. Still, that netted the company a valuation of roughly
          $21 billion, and shares remained above the $7.31 and $9.17 average prices where they had changed hands
          in private trades in August and September, respectively.                
          "We experienced slowness that may have resulted in delayed logins into our system. At all times, our call
          centers were available to execute trades. We will work through any issue that is brought to our attention and
          ensure that no employee will be disadvantaged," a Shareworks by Morgan Stanley spokeswoman said. The
          implication is that employees who had to sell at a lower price will be "made whole," according to a person
          close to the bank.                                                      
          Palantir didn't respond to requests for comment.                        
          In Slack channels, former employees complained about problems getting into Shareworks as the system
          experienced timeouts and errors saying the website was down, according to people familiar with the
          communications.                                                         
          Palantir Chief Executive and co-founder Alex Karp, in an interview with CNBC, said he had been skeptical
          about the public markets, but that it was important to let employees sell shares. "I believe the people who've
          built this company over 17 years deserved access to liquidity," he said.
          The Palantir hiccup came on what was already shaping up to be a tricky day for its advisers and the NYSE.
          The exchange had never dealt with opening two direct listings on the same day. Given the relatively untested
          nature of direct listings and their complexities, some people close to the Palantir and Asana offerings had told
          The Wall Street Journal they weren't thrilled that two were happening on the same day.
          But the listings seemed to go off without a hitch from an exchange perspective, with both stocks opening
          smoothly and not experiencing much volatility throughout the trading day.
                                                                                  
          Doing a direct listing skirts investment-banking underwriters, allowing companies to save millions of dollars in
          fees. It also means the companies don't raise money for themselves. Instead, employees and early investors
          are typically able to cash out stock on the first day of trading as shares simply list on the exchange and
          advisers match buyers and sellers. Both Asana and Palantir enlisted Citadel Securities as designated market
          maker and Morgan Stanley as lead financial adviser for their debuts.

          Palantir and Asana both entered a red-hot IPO market in which investors have paid up for growing
          technology companies. September was the busiest month for initial public offerings in the NYSE's history.
          Asana and Palantir became the third and fourth notable firms to use the direct listing model. Only two other
          major companies, Spotify Technology SA and Slack Technologies Inc., had ever completed direct listings
          before Wednesday.                                                       
          Both stocks closed above their reference price, a guidepost that is set by the New York Stock Exchange
          where no money changes hands.                                           
                                                                                  
          Asana's shares closed at $28.80, which is 37% above their reference price of $21 and above the average
          price of $25.11 where private shares changed hands in August. That gave the company, which makes
          workplace tools for productivity and communication, a valuation of about $5.9 billion.
