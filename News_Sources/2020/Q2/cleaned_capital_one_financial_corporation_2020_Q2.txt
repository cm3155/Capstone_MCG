          Robert Rodriguez and Migdalia Wharton, a married couple in Orlando, Fla., have been out of work for more
          than a month and can't afford to pay their credit-card bills.           
          When they called Capital One Financial Corp. to explain, the bank told them they could skip their April
          payments. But they doubt they will have money in May. Ms. Wharton, a school-bus driver, was told she
          wouldn't get paid until school reopens. Mr. Rodriguez, a cancer survivor, is worried for his health and has
          stopped driving for Uber.                                               
          "We don't know what we're going to do," Mr. Rodriguez said.             
                                                                                  
          Many large card issuers, including Capital One, Discover Financial Services and Synchrony Financial, are
          letting borrowers pause their credit-card payments for a month or longer. Some are lowering or waiving late
          fees and interest charges, or even forgiving portions of customers' balances.
                                                                                  
          Capital One, which has about 120 million credit-card accounts in the U.S., according to the Nilson Report, said it enrolled 1% of its active card accounts into
          deferral programs. The three banks are a good gauge of the financial health of a swath of U.S. consumers.
          Discover and Synchrony generally don't market to affluent customers, and Capital One has a large number of
          customers with less-than-pristine credit scores.                        
                                                                                  
          Discover, Capital One, American Express Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other card issuers have together
          socked away billions of extra dollars to prepare for big potential loan losses.
                                                                                  
          In Orlando, Mr. Rodriguez and Ms. Wharton used their Capital One credit cards to buy groceries, toilet paper
          and medicine for several weeks after they found themselves out of work. They recently were approved for
          food stamps.                                                            
          They told Capital One they might not be able to pay their bills in May, either. They said they were told to call
          back at the end of April if they are still in financial distress.
