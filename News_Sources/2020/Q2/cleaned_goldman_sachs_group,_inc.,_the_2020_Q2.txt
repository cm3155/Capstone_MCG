          At Goldman Sachs, profits fell 46 percent to $1.2 billion, reflecting a set-aside of an additional $937 million for
          potential credit losses, losses in its asset-management division and a rise in technology costs.
          But the bank's revenue was essentially flat, helped in part by a 28 percent upswing in trading revenue and a
          25 percent rise in investment-banking fees related primarily to direct lending to corporations and help when
          they raised public money through the bond and stock markets.
