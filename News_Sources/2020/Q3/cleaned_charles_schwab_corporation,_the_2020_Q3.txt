          Traders and analysts expect MEMX to be a formidable competitor to the incumbent exchanges. The New
          Jersey-based startup has raised more than $135 million from firms including Charles Schwab Corp., Citadel
          Securities, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Virtu Financial Inc. Backers of MEMX are expected to direct some
          of their trading activity to MEMX, helping it get off the ground.

          Fidelity Investments, which rolled out fractional trading to customers in January and February, says more
          than 340,000 of its accounts have placed a fractional trade, in which the customer buys or sells less than an
          entire share. Interactive Brokers Group Inc., another online brokerage, says around 117,000 users have
          enabled fractional trading since the firm released the feature to individual investors in November. Charles
          Schwab Corp. says more than 60,000 accounts have bought its "Stock Slices" since it turned on the feature
          in June.
