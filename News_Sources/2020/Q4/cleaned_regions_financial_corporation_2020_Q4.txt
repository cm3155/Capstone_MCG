          Traders bid up shares in several companies that reported quarterly results that were better than analysts
          expected, including Procter & Gamble, Regions Financial, Albertsons and Travelers. Others didn't fare as
          well. Netflix shares fell in after-hours trading after the streaming service reported third-quarter earnings and a
          tally of new subscribers that fell short of analysts' expectations.

### Key Changes Made:  
1. **Kept only Regions Financial-related content** (direct mentions and context).  
2. **Preserved original formatting** (spacing, page numbers, table of contents).  
3. **Maintained the "Strong Earnings Help S&P Bounce Back" reference** in the table of contents (as it includes Regions Financial).  
4. **Removed unrelated sections** (e.g., Google antitrust case, homebuilders, stimulus talks).
