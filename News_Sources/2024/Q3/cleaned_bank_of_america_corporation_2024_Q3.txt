          JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America plan to limit and more closely track young bankers' hours following a
          Wall Street Journal investigation that detailed a dangerous culture of overwork on Wall Street.
          Meanwhile, Bank of America is implementing a new timekeeping tool that requires junior bankers
          to go into more detail about how their time is spent, other people familiar with the matter said.
          The changes come after the Journal investigation, based on conversations with more than three dozen
          current and former bankers, revealed that junior bankers at Bank of America were routinely instructed to lie
          about their hours to avoid exceeding hourly limits.                     
          The death of a 35-year-old Bank of America associate who had been working 100-hour weeks led to an
          outcry in the industry about employee protections being ignored. Leo Lukenas III had been working on a team
          completing a $2 billion deal. An autopsy found he died of a blood clot that formed in a coronary artery.
          Bank of America had already capped young bankers' hours, but the Journal found that the guidelines were
          routinely violated and in some cases bosses told direct reports to lie about how much they were working.
          Shortly after the Journal's investigation was published, the bank told employees to alert superiors or the
          human-resources department if they were being pressured to lie about their hours, the Journal reported at the
          time.                                                                   
          In recent days, Bank of America unveiled a new tool in the company's timekeeping software that requires
          U.S.-based junior investment bankers to log their hours daily rather than weekly, people familiar with the
          matter said. They also will be required to detail which deals they are working on when, and which senior
          bankers are overseeing the assignments, the people said. Junior staff also can gauge how much capacity
          they have for more work on a scale from 1 to 4.                         
          The new reporting tool will go live next week, the people said. It was being developed before Lukenas's
          death.                                                                  
          "We successfully piloted this improved technology platform earlier this year to help our team more efficiently

          The death over a decade ago of a Bank of America intern in London who had logged long hours at the office
          prompted some soul-searching in the industry. But enforcement of protective guidelines put in place by many
          banks has been inconsistent over the years.

          Yuliya Lavysh was thrilled to accept a job offer from Bank of America while a student at Smith College. She
          quit in 2022 after three years in the Chicago office, where senior bankers kept her and her teammates at their
          desks until 5 a.m. and instructed them to lie about their hours. Once, she said, she worked until 4 a.m. in the
          office and was on her way home in a taxi, only for her boss to request more changes for a proposal to a client
          and to leave a printed copy for senior staff to review later that morning. She asked the cabdriver to turn
          around.                                                                 
          Roy Wang worked as a junior investment banker for the bank in Tokyo. He said he meticulously logged his
          overtime hours. But when human resources told his bosses he was working too much, a manager told him to
          report only as many as were allowed by the bank's policies. He said he continued to work at least one
          all-nighter every week -- saying it wasn't unusual for junior bankers to catch a few hours of sleep in a
          bathroom stall or a conference room. He left after his doctor flagged his cholesterol and other indicators had
          spiked to unhealthy levels.                                             
          An analyst on the Latin American finance team in New York collapsed last year after working long hours,
          prompting his colleagues to call an ambulance to the office.            
          Another New York banker, currently a vice president, checked into a hospital this year after he felt rundown
          and sick from working around the clock -- yet he chose to continue fulfilling tasks and took client calls from his
          bed.                                                                    
          Then in May, a Bank of America associate died. He had been putting in over 100 hours a week to finish work
          on a $2 billion acquisition.                                            
          The Wall Street Journal spoke to more than three dozen people familiar with the working conditions at Bank
          of America, including former and current investment bankers ranging from junior to executive level in offices
          around the world.                                                       
          Many described how superiors instruct junior bankers to ignore policies that limit working hours. The
          experiences clash with rules added a decade ago to protect bankers from being overworked, raising scrutiny
          of the bank's work culture. The restrictions were put in place after another death -- a Bank of America intern in
          London died of a seizure after working several all-nighters in a row.   
          The death in May sparked a new public outcry over banks' treatment of young employees and the potential
          consequences of too much work. The experiences at Bank of America are echoed in banks across Wall
          Street, where long hours and deference to bosses' commands, no matter how unreasonable, are the norm
          industrywide. In jobs where entry level salaries can reach $200,000, many bankers say they hesitate to raise
          concerns about their working conditions.                                
          A spokeswoman for Bank of America said that "our practices are clear and we expect all employees including
          managers to follow them. When we've learned of violations, disciplinary actions have been taken." She said
          investment banking jobs at the bank are "sought after [and] challenging jobs," and that the bank received
          roughly 500,000 applications for entry-level positions over the past four years, while turnover for associates is
          under 10%.

          Since the recent death, some managers have told junior bankers the bank is enforcing rules about hours
          more strictly, people who work at the bank said. Senior bankers have also vowed to keep better tabs on
          bankers' work loads, the people said.                                   
                                                                                  
          Some banks rolled out "protected weekends" to guarantee at least one day off a week, but many at Bank of
          America said those policies are frequently ignored by their managers.   
                                                                                  
          Moritz Erhardt, the Bank of America intern in London, died in 2013 after logging long hours at the office. The
          bank appointed a group to review "all aspects of the tragedy" including whether employees were encouraged
          to work overly long hours or had been pushed into unhealthily competitive environments on the job, the
          Journal reported at the time.                                           
          An autopsy found Erhardt died of an epileptic seizure that was possibly brought on by fatigue.
          In response, the bank in 2014 instituted policies to limit young bankers' hours. It required them to start logging
          their hours, and managers would receive a warning when they logged more than 80 in a week. If they worked
          more than 100, they would be flagged to the bank's human resources department, which would intervene to
          get them time off.                                                      
          It also instituted a protected weekends policy, under which junior bankers were required to take off either a
          Saturday or Sunday every week, unless managers had received exemptions for must-do work from human
          resources. Other banks including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan followed suit on protected weekends.
                                                                                  
          Bank of America later tweaked its weekend policy, shifting it to a "protected Saturday" policy -- making
          Sunday a regular workday.                                               
          Several current and former bankers at Bank of America said they were asked to violate those policies or
          directly witnessed them being contravened. They said many senior bankers across the institution tell junior
          bankers to avoid logging their actual hours, leaving them to work 15- or 16-hour days "off the books" for
          weeks.                                                                  
          One current associate said the bank's human-resources department intervened after he worked over 100
          hours a week for a month. When his bosses were forced to give him a day off, he planned a long bike ride to
          clear his mind. He had just started biking when his manager called and said he needed him to work several
          hours that day without logging the hours.                               
          Junior bankers working in Bank of America's leveraged-finance group, which specializes in financing
          corporate takeovers with high-interest debt, said their team has been overburdened after the bank laid off
          junior bankers during a slowdown last year. The pressure to perform has been acute at the bank, which has
          said it is fighting to expand its investment-banking business.          
          Bank of America declined to comment on the specific examples of working conditions.
                                                                                  
          The hard-nosed work culture at Bank of America and elsewhere on Wall Street again came under scrutiny
          after Leo Lukenas III, the Bank of America associate, died on May 2.    
          Lukenas, who was 35 years old, had been working over 100-hour weeks for about a month, according to
          people working on his team, as the group finalized the $2 billion acquisition of Heartland Finance by UMB
          Bank, which was announced April 29. He attended a celebratory dinner for the deal two days later. He died
          before coming into work the following day.                              
          An autopsy found he died when a blood clot formed in a coronary artery. 
                                                                                  
          Junior bankers working with Lukenas said they told co-workers they were exhausted and had been
          underreporting their hours to avoid human resources getting involved. They also said it was a common
          practice on the team for bosses to assign work on Saturdays without requesting formal exceptions.
          Bank of America declined to comment on Lukenas's work conditions. Lukenas's family members didn't
          respond to requests for comment or declined to comment.                 
          Lukenas became a banker after serving in the U.S. Special Forces for over a decade. As a Green Beret, he
          did several tours in the Middle East.                                   
          Lukenas had a wife and two young children as well as a twin brother -- also a veteran -- who started in
          investment banking at Goldman Sachs weeks after his brother's death.    
                                                                                  
          A few days after Lukenas died, managers at Bank of America held calls with junior bankers and some
          acknowledged that they might be asking too much of them. Midlevel staff responsible for setting junior
          bankers' schedules also told some of them in private conversations that the bank is focused on keeping
          closer tabs on hours.                                                   
                                                                                  
          One Bank of America associate said she worked from around 8 a.m. to 4 a.m. every day for about a week
          last year, adding new debt transaction ideas and acquisition target analyses to a client proposal at her boss's
          behest. The hours should have tripped the bank's controls, but her boss had asked her not to log all of them.
          She worked overnight Wednesday and Thursday to meet the deadline. The boss responded by requesting
          more changes by the next morning.                                       
                                                                                  
          The associate, who still works at the bank, said she got a reprieve when another senior employee overheard
          her crying in the bathroom and confronted her boss, saying she had been pushed too far. The client they
          pitched went on to make several acquisitions, but never hired Bank of America on any.
