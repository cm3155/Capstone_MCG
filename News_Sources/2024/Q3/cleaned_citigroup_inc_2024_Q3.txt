          JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo reported last week jumps in investment-banking revenue. More
          favorable economic conditions and booming markets gave corporate executives the confidence to pursue
          mergers, refinance debt and issue stock.                                
          Both JPMorgan and Wells Fargo posted 6% revenue increases in their asset- and wealth-management businesses, while Citi's
          wealth-unit revenue was up 2%. All four banks reported higher trading revenue.
          JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo reported increases in investment-banking revenue of 46%, 60% and
          38%, respectively, in the second quarter from a year earlier.           
                                                                                  
          Goldman's investment-banking revenue increased 21%, though it was down from the bank's first quarter this
          year, as were Citi's and Wells Fargo's. This marks the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth
          in Goldman's investment-banking fees following two years of mostly declines. Solomon said the firm's
          investment-banking backlog increased significantly.
