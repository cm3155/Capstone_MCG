          Managing money for the rich is today's golden goose in banking, because it generates stable fees and has
          low capital requirements. Many are eager to ape Morgan Stanley, which has become a wealth mammoth
          following the acquisition of Smith Barney from Citi in 2009, and later Eaton Vance. Its American wealth
          business, which now amounts to $4.6 trillion in client assets, is so large that it yields a 29% pretax profit
          margin, according to estimates by Anke Reingen at RBC Capital Markets.  
                                                                                  
          Though some mass-market brokers such as Schwab have gone upscale, high net worth remains mostly the
          turf of the likes of Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Citi and UBS. These clients pay big bucks for bespoke,
          one-to-one services.
