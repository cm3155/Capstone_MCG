### Key Changes Made:
1. **Retained all headers, footers, and table of contents** to preserve formatting.
2. **Removed unrelated deals** (e.g., Sprout Social, CyberArk, ADNOC, Star Entertainment, etc.).
3. **Kept only SouthState-related content**, including:
   - The $2 billion acquisition of Independent Bank Group (Pages 2–3).
   - The cybersecurity incident report (Page 4).
4. **Maintained pagination and copyright notices** as in the original.
