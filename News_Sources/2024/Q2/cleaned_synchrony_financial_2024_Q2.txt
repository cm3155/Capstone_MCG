          Last week, Apple announced one of those companies would be Affirm, which it is adding as an option in the
          fall. Citigroup and Synchrony Financial will also be a part of the rollout, Apple said. The company is also
          adding a scannable code that will help shoppers use Apple Pay across the web.

          Announcements out of the tech company's latest product showcase included enhancements to Apple Pay,
          the digital wallet whose size and stature has rapidly expanded in recent years. They included a feature that
          will enable banks to offer buy now, pay later installment payments via their cards loaded into users' Apple
          Pay wallets. In the U.S., Citigroup, Synchrony Financial and Apple Pay issuers using Fiserv, a software
          provider to many banks, will be part of the initial rollout, Apple said.
          Apple also is introducing the ability to pay for a purchase with card rewards, adding that much more value to
          those points, and giving banks another opportunity to win a transaction. Discover Financial Services,
          Synchrony and Fiserv's issuers will be the initial participants, Apple said.
