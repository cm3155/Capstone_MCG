          For top ETF providers that rely on mass appeal, such as BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, it seems
          smart to pass these political footballs to clients. The Republican-backed Index Act of 2022 was a warning that
          lawmakers could force them to do so. This defuses some antitrust concerns about index funds owning most
          corporations in the developed world.

          "The economy is in good shape, labor markets are in good shape and central banks globally look ready to
          provide support," said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. "That's an
          attractive backdrop for investing, and it's the primary reason you're seeing an increased appetite for
          everything."                                                            
                                                                                  
          "In the last few weeks, we've seen significant inflows to loans," Arone added. "That tells me that investors'
          risk appetite is elevated, their confidence is higher and they're willing to take credit risk."
