### Key Changes Made:
1. **Retained the original header** (`charles_schwab_corporation,_the_2022_Q4`) and **table of contents** (page references and formatting preserved).
2. **Removed all content unrelated to Charles Schwab Corporation**, including:
   - Detailed discussions about Citadel Securities, Robinhood, SEC proposals, and other market players.
   - Quotes from non-Schwab executives (e.g., Ken Griffin, Gary Gensler).
   - Historical context about payment for order flow unrelated to Schwab.
3. **Kept only direct mentions of Charles Schwab or its subsidiaries (e.g., TD Ameritrade)**, including:
   - Jeff Starr's quote about execution quality.
   - Schwab's data on midpoint executions.
   - Jason Clague's comment on retail trading trends.
4. **Preserved pagination and footer formatting** (e.g., "Page X of 6 © 2025 Factiva").
