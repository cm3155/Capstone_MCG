          Disappointing earnings reports from several big companies don't seem to be fazing investors, with the S&P
          500 up nearly 5% this month, and 2.5% last week, after a punishing start to the year.
          Even some companies that have posted sharply lower quarterly results have seen their shares rally in the
          following days. Bank of America Corp. posted a slimmer-than-expected profit last week, yet its shares
          finished the session little changed and jumped 3.4% the subsequent day.

          Bank of America's global fund manager survey for July, which was released last week, showed investor
          pessimism at a "dire level" and the market mood as "max bearish." Such bleak sentiment is often a contrarian
          signal that suggests stocks could rally in coming weeks, the bank's analysts said.

          Bank of America Fined$225 Million Over Aid                              
          Two federal regulators fined Bank of America $225 million on Thursday for mishandling prepaid debit card
          accounts used by a dozen states to distribute unemployment benefits during the pandemic, and the bank
          must compensate people for damages, an amount likely to total hundreds of millions more, federal officials
          said.                                                                   
          Because of a faulty fraud detection program, Bank of America improperly froze accounts and stymied
          customers who sought to have them unlocked, cutting people off from desperately needed funds in 2020 and
          2021, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said.                    
          Bank of America said the problems had stemmed from state systems besieged with fraudulent claims.
                                                                                  
          The pandemic ''created unprecedented criminal activity where illegal applicants were able to get states to
          approve tens of billions of dollars in payments,'' said Bill Halldin, a bank spokesman. STACY COWLEY
