          Wall Street's biggest banks have largely avoided investing directly in cryptocurrencies. But many are quietly
          working to integrate blockchain, the technology behind crypto, into trading and other businesses.
          JPMorgan Chase & Co. has a platform in place, called Onyx.                       
          Big Wall Street firms help make the economy run, connecting buyers and sellers of securities and lending
          money to businesses. But their sophisticated trades are often run on creaky old systems. Goldman and
          others hope they will be able to run faster, less-costly and ultimately more-profitable systems based on
          blockchains.                                                            
          Some rivals are also planning for wider platforms. JPMorgan's Onyx platform, launched in 2020, can be used
          by other banks. Goldman, BNP Paribas and others have been using it to trade repos, or repurchase
          agreements. JPMorgan said Onyx has processed more than $350 billion of repo transactions.
          "They're doing real trades," said Yuval Rooz, the chief executive of Digital Asset, which writes blockchain
          software and counts Goldman and the Australian Stock Exchange among its clients. Still, he said, competition
          is tight.

          JPMorgan Chase & Co. is assembling the pieces to launch a full-service travel business where customers
          can plan and book trips ranging from a domestic flight to an extravagant safari.
          The nation's largest bank bought a booking system, a restaurant-review company and a luxury travel agent. It
          is building its own airport lounges and a force of thousands of travel agents. A website will launch in the
          coming months.                                                          
          Travel has become one of the most important spending categories for banks and credit-card issuers, and
          JPMorgan wants a bigger piece of it. The bank hopes to turn those traveling customers into lifelong fans,
          drawing in more of their spending and other financial needs.            
          JPMorgan already plays a small role in the travel world. Its own credit cards, like the Sapphire Reserve, let
          customers build up travel rewards and cash them in through the bank's Ultimate Rewards booking website.
          JPMorgan estimates that its customers account for $1 of every $3 spent on leisure travel in the U.S., though
          those customers book only a tiny amount on the Ultimate Rewards website.
          With the new offerings, JPMorgan executives said the bank could capture $15 billion in bookings in 2025, five
          times what it handled before the recent buildup. That would make it the third-biggest travel agent in the U.S.,
          based on 2021 volumes, according to industry publication Travel Weekly. That is still far smaller than the
          parent companies of booking.com and Expedia, which each manage more than $70 billion.
          The idea is for JPMorgan to control the entire shopping and buying experience for a purchase customers are
          passionate about. Automobiles and homes might be next, executives said. 
          "These are huge circles of customer spend where we have a real opportunity to differentiate what it means to
          use Chase products," said Allison Beer, the head of cards and what the bank is calling connected commerce.
                                                                                  
          The plan has risks. Travel-rewards giveaways have proved expensive for JPMorgan and other banks, and
          they haven't always led to the lasting relationships the banks hoped for. JPMorgan also has important
          corporate partnerships with airlines and hotels that expect the bank to send customers their way. Some of
          those partners have already complained about the success of Sapphire taking away customers from their
          cards.                                                                  
          JPMorgan isn't alone in trying to cross into travel bookings. American Express Co. is the sixth-biggest travel
          agent. Capital One Financial Corp. last year invested in a booking company to build its own travel site and
          opened its first airport lounge.                                        
          JPMorgan said it believes it can differentiate itself partly because of its detailed insight into what its customers
          spend. Its data will power both travel agents and artificial-intelligence technology that can target customers
          with offers and ideas.                                                  
          "The issuers have learned that nothing drives spending like travel rewards," said Samuel Engel, senior vice
          president of aviation at consultant ICF International. "American consumers will stop at nothing to earn those
          magical points."                                                        
          Travel has been at the center of JPMorgan's card offerings since it launched the Sapphire Preferred, in 2009,
          allowing users to build up travel dollars not tied to a single airline or hotel.
          A flashier premium version in 2016, the Sapphire Reserve, became a hit, especially with young millennial
          spenders. The bank got a taste of being a travel agent, managing booking systems and purchasing trips on
          behalf of customers.

          Executives saw room for improvement. They thought existing booking systems made it hard to redeem
          rewards, which they feared would cost them customers.                   
          When the pandemic struck in early 2020 and travel ground to a halt, JPMorgan spied an opportunity for
          acquisitions. Discussions to switch its booking systems to cxLoyalty turned into buying the whole company in
          December 2020.                                                          
          In 2021, with travel spending ticking back up, the bank announced it would launch Chase Sapphire airport
          lounges. Its partner, the owner of The Club lounge chain, is constructing nine lounges in cities, including
          Boston, Hong Kong and Phoenix, each with local designs and food.        
          In September last year, JPMorgan announced it was buying The Infatuation, a restaurant review site that
          includes the Zagat brand. Chase wanted to give customers better advice on where to spend rewards. The
          business had significant customer overlap with Sapphire, said Chris Stang, Infatuation's co-founder and chief
          exexecutive.                                                            
          It is starting to review hotels and compile complete city guides.       
                                                                                  
          JPMorgan this year added luxury travel shop Frosch International Travel, with more than 1,000 agents. Now,
          the bank is building the website for Chase travel, which will open for credit-card customers by year-end and
          all bank customers in 2023, executives said.                            
          The bank hasn't disclosed how much it paid for any of the acquisitions. 
                                                                                  
          It signaled that the new travel business could eventually book an annual $750 million in profit, compared with
          the $48 billion it made last year.                                      
          JPMorgan executives say they want to dominate on extravagant itineraries, helping customers book spas,
          dinners and experiences.                                                
          "More people are interested in being inspired right now, saying, 'I want to have one of those
          social-media-type moments so tell me where to go,'" said said Jason Wynn, the head of the new travel unit.
                                                                                  
          The bank is already seeing early signs of that luxury demand. The average price Chase customers are
          paying for hotels is more than double the industry average, the bank said.
          One customer recently booked a seven-night stay in Maui for more than $48,000.
                                                                                  
          The bank also offers buy- now, pay-later installment plans on travel and executives said they want to book
          for less-wealthy customers too.                                         
          "You have a whole range of customers who are looking for these wonderful experiences some of the time,"
          Ms. Beer said, "but they aren't going to splurge all of the time."
