          This spring, Clive Kabatznik, an investor in Florida, called his local Bank of America representative to discuss
          a big money transfer he was planning to make. Then he called again.     
          Except the second phone call wasn't from Mr. Kabatznik. Rather, a software program had artificially
          generated his voice and tried to trick the banker into moving the money elsewhere.
          Mr. Kabatznik and his banker were the targets of a cutting-edge scam attempt that has grabbed the attention
          of cybersecurity experts: the use of artificial intelligence to generate voice deepfakes, or vocal renditions
          that mimic real people's voices.                                        
          In Mr. Kabatznik's case, the fraud was detectable. But the speed of technological development, the falling
          costs of generative artificial intelligence programs and the wide availability of recordings of people's voices on
          the internet have created the perfect conditions for voice-related A.I. scams.
          ''We regularly train our team to identify and recognize scams and help our clients avoid them,'' said William
          Halldin, a Bank of America spokesman. He said he could not comment on specific customers or their
          experiences.

          Broker-dealer Merrill Lynch has agreed to pay a total of $12 million in fines to regulators for failing to file
          about 1,500 suspicious-activity reports over more than a decade.        
          Under U.S. anti-money-laundering rules, broker-dealers like Merrill Lynch are required to file
          suspicious-activity reports to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network on transactions above $5,000 when
          they might signal criminal activities, such as tax evasion, to assist U.S. government agencies in detecting and
          preventing money laundering.                                            
          Merrill Lynch's parent company, which was implementing the broker-dealer's anti-money-laundering
          program following Bank of America's acquisition of Merrill during the 2008-09 financial crisis, used a $25,000
          threshold, instead of the $5,000 one, for reporting SARs between 2009 and late 2019, the Securities and
          Exchange Commission said Tuesday.                                       
          Merrill agreed to pay $6 million to settle the SEC charges.             
          In a parallel enforcement action, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the brokerage industry's
          self-regulator, fined Merrill an additional $6 million for longstanding anti-money-laundering program failures,
          the regulator said Tuesday. Finra alleged Merrill failed to apply the right threshold for SARs reporting for more
          than 10 years and failed to file nearly 1,500 SARs to regulators.       
          "Following an internal review, we reported this matter to regulators and have enhanced our process and
          training regarding these filings," a spokeswoman for Merrill Lynch said in an email.
