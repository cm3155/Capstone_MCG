          The News                                                                
          Goldman Sachs on Wednesday reported quarterly profit that fell short of even dampened expectations,
          another reminder of the troubles facing one of Wall Street's premier names.
          The investment bank, which has spent much of this year unwinding mistakes of years past, reported a profit
          half as large as that of its rival Morgan Stanley, to say nothing of larger lenders.
          At Goldman, the pain was distributed across the board, in its investment bank, sputtering consumer arm,
          slowing trading operations and commercial real estate portfolio. David Solomon, the bank's chief executive,
          called it ''obviously a tough quarter.''                                
                                                                                  
          Perhaps in an indication of how low analyst projections had been, shares rose nearly 1 percent on
          Wednesday.                                                              
          The Numbers                                                             
                                                                                  
          Goldman Sachs reported a profit of $1.1 billion in the second quarter, down more than 60 percent from a year
          earlier.                                                                
          The bank highlighted write-downs in the value of its commercial real estate portfolio, a $1.2 billion hit to profit,
          and the buy-now-pay-later firm GreenSky, which subtracted nearly $700 million from its earnings. Goldman
          acquired GreenSky less than two years ago, as part of an ill-fated foray into consumer lending.
          Quarterly revenue, at $10.9 billion, was 8 percent lower than it was a year earlier.
                                                                                  
          The bank employed 44,600 people at the end of June, down 2,400 from a year earlier. Goldman has gone
          through at least three rounds of layoffs this year, taking head count down 8 percent so far this year.
          Takeaways                                                               
          This seems to have been a rip-the-Band-Aid-off quarter for Goldman. The real estate write-down, in
          particular, appeared to pack potential losses into the period.          
                                                                                  
          There are, however, good reasons for the move. Remote or hybrid work appears here to stay, and that has
          bleak implications for office space and landlords in many cities. Having already conceded some losses in that
          area, Goldman can now shift attention to other areas of the business like investment banking, which tends to
          ebb and flow.                                                           
          ''It definitely feels better over the course of the last six to eight weeks than it felt earlier in the year,'' Mr.
          Solomon said.                                                           
          Context                                                                 
                                                                                  
          The big question for Mr. Solomon is whether he can convince investors -- and many inside his own firm -- of a
          return to the much-feared Goldman of yore.                              
          The bank is nearly a year into an extended apologia for its consumer woes, which at one point included
          Marcus, a consumer division named after the company's founder, credit-card offerings and savings accounts
          aimed at the mass market. The bank said this year that it had lost more than $3 billion tied to those efforts
          since December 2020.

          The bank is still unwinding most of the business, at a loss, and it may expect more ugly headlines until that is
          finished.                                                               
          What's Next                                                             
                                                                                  
          Unlike more diversified lenders like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman relies heavily on its Wall Street franchise,
          and corporate activity has been muted in the face of economic uncertainty, rising interest rates and the like.
          That means that if there is a prolonged chill in deal-making, there may be little that the bank can do to fully
          insulate itself.

          Goldman Sachs Group is trying to end its partnership with Apple.        
          The Wall Street firm is in talks with American Express to take over its Apple credit card and other ventures
          with the tech giant, according to people familiar with the matter.      
          Goldman went public with plans to scale back its consumer business late last year, but it appeared committed
          to the Apple relationship. The bank recently extended the partnership through the end of the decade, agreed
          to support Apple's "buy now, pay later" offering and launched a bank account with the tech company.
          Now it is in talks to offload those businesses and its credit-card partnership to Amex, according to people
          familiar with the discussions. Goldman has also discussed transferring its card partnership with General
          Motors to Amex or another issuer, some of the people said.              
          A deal with Amex isn't imminent or assured, people familiar with the conversations said, and it could take a
          while to transfer the partnership in any case. Apple would have to agree to a transfer. The tech company is
          aware of the talks, which have been ongoing for months, the people said.
                                                                                  
          A retreat from Apple and credit cards would effectively end Goldman's consumer-lending business. The bank
          has already stopped issuing personal loans, and it is trying to sell GreenSky, the home-improvement lender it
          bought just last year.                                                  
          Exiting the Apple partnership would also seal the fate of Goldman's grand plans to become a full-service
          bank. Goldman, a firm best known for dominating the Wall Street businesses of investment banking and
          trading, first made a play for Main Street with its Marcus high-yield savings account in 2016. Three years
          later, it expanded into credit cards with its splashy Apple partnership. Goldman reached a deal for GreenSky
          in late 2021 and closed on the purchase early last year.                
          Goldman quickly became a presence in the bidding wars for co-branded credit-card deals, long the territory of
          megabanks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup that have giant consumer arms.
          That changed when Goldman decided to scale back its consumer ambitions late last year following an
          internal review. Goldman ended talks with T-Mobile to launch a credit card and stepped away from bidding on
          new programs, The Wall Street Journal reported in February. A few months later, Goldman said it would look
          for a buyer for GreenSky.                                               
          Still, Goldman stayed close to Apple. On a call with analysts in October, Chief Executive David Solomon
          talked up the relationship after announcing the bank's broader retreat from full-service consumer banking.
          "It's a very, very strong partnership where there's a lot of opportunity," Solomon said at the time. The bank
          launched a savings account with Apple in April.                         
                                                                                  
          Solomon has fielded a lot of internal criticism for presiding over the costly consumer foray. In January,
          Goldman disclosed that it had lost about $3 billion on the consumer-lending push since 2020.
          Should Goldman get out of the credit-card business and sell GreenSky, its consumer business would be
          reduced to its original product: the Marcus savings account.            
          The bank has said it has no plans to stop taking consumer deposits.
