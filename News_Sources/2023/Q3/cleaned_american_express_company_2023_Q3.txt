          The Wall Street firm is in talks with American Express to take over its Apple credit card and other ventures
          with the tech giant, according to people familiar with the matter.

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Kept the header (first line)** and **table of contents** (references to pages 2 and 4).
2. **Retained only American Express-related content**:
   - From the first article, kept the mention of American Express's earnings-day selloff and stock decline.
   - From the second article, kept the section where Goldman Sachs is in talks with American Express to take over the Apple credit card venture.
3. **Removed unrelated content** (e.g., discussions about the Dow, other companies, commodities, bonds, etc.).
4. **Preserved original formatting**, spacing, and pagination.
