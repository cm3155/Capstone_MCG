          Moody's Investors Service downgraded 10 regional banks, sending bank shares down and renewing
          concerns about the health of the sector amid higher interest rates and recent failures.
          The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index and the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF both slipped about 1%.
          The Moody's downgrades late Monday hit the regional powerhouse M&T Bank as well as a number of smaller
          banks. Webster Financial, BOK Financial and Old National Bancorp were among the other banks that
          Moody's downgraded. Shares of all of those banks traded lower.          
          The reaction suggests the sector remains vulnerable to the problems that stirred a panic this spring after the
          failures of several midsize lenders: devalued bonds, jittery investors, deposit withdrawals and higher costs.
