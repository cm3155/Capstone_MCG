          Trying to keep the bad guys from stealing your credit-card number? Consider using a virtual card for online or
          phone purchases.                                                        
          Customers of credit-card firms such as Capital One can generate a
          virtual-card number for an individual purchase when they are concerned about the security of using their
          permanent-card number. This free service uses regular credit-card accounts to generate unique numbers,
          card-verification codes and expiration dates.                           
          Virtual credit cards have existed for many years, but many consumers and business owners haven't used
          them. Now, as online fraud and security breaches are on the rise, virtual credit cards are an underused tool
          that can help shoppers protect themselves, some security experts say.   
          Here are answers to frequently asked questions consumers may have about virtual cards:
          Why should I consider a virtual card?                                   
                                                                                  
          The primary reason: Virtual cards can reduce the damage done by fraud. They come with the same
          protections against fraud that plastic comes with; federal law says consumers aren't liable for more than $50
          in charges that result from lost or stolen credit-card information. But the time and energy expended to replace
          a compromised card can be a hassle, especially if it is used for automated payments.
          "Think about how much damage you would have to repair," says Rajendran Murthy, associate professor at
          the Rochester Institute of Technology's Saunders College of Business.   
          Issuers, merchants and financial institutions lost $32.34 billion to credit-card fraud in 2021, with the U.S.
          accounting for slightly more than one-third of the losses, according to the Nilson Report, a research
          publication for the payments industry. One way credit cards can be stolen is when shoppers keep their card
          on file with an online retailer for convenience. If a thief gains access to the company's databases, the saved
          data is vulnerable. Virtual cards help reduce the chance your actual card data will be stolen.
          Murthy says virtual cards also can help people manage subscriptions without being concerned about auto
          renewal; simply use a virtual card that expires before the renewal date, he says. Virtual cards could also be
          handy for parents whose children play online games that feature in-game purchases. These charges can
          quickly add up if no one is monitoring the card. By setting a limit, a parent can better control this type of
          spending, without constantly monitoring their credit card.              
          How do I get a virtual card?                                            
          First, your card company has to offer the option for your particular card. Several banks offer virtual cards only
          to corporate cardholders or for select cards. Assuming the option is available, the next step will depend on
          the provider. Sometimes, virtual cards can be created using a link on the card issuer's website after the user
          logs in to his or her account. With other providers, users can access virtual cards through internet browser
          extensions, meaning the types of data, like passwords, addresses and phone numbers, that a browser can
          remember. As an example, Amex users who are logged into their Google account can select their virtual card
          number from the payment options drop-down and Chrome automatically populates the payment information.
          Users then continue to check out, possibly receiving a one-time verification code by text to confirm their
          identity before completing the purchase.                                
          How do I use a virtual card?                                            
          Using a virtual card can require some extra work for consumers. Before customers use the service to make
          an online purchase, some card providers require them to first log in to their credit-card account and receive

          an authentication code. Once they are authenticated, they can shop using virtual cards. Some providers offer
          the option of using multiple virtual cards with different numbers that can vary by purchase limit. Other users
          have quick access to them through browser extensions.                   
          Are they all the same?                                                  
          While the basic concept is the same, virtual cards can function differently, depending on the provider. Some
          virtual cards are for single use, while others can be used multiple times and allow customers to set spending
          limits and expiration dates. Capital One
          users can lock or unlock their virtual cards at any time.               
          Privacy.com offers another option for shopping with virtual cards. Use of its virtual service is free for up to 12
          new cards a month. Each card can be either a single-use card that automatically closes itself or a card that
          can be used only at one merchant. Otherwise, there are two fee-based models, one at $10 a month for up to
          36 new cards a month and the other for $25 a month for up to 60 cards in that time frame.
          Do I need one if I have a mobile wallet?                                
                                                                                  
          Consumers like mobile wallets offered by providers such as Apple and Google because they enter their card
          into the wallet, but their actual number doesn't get transmitted to the merchant. Mobile wallet users also
          generally have liability protection against verified unauthorized transactions. However, not all online
          merchants support this type of payment, so virtual cards can be a safe alternative, industry professionals say.
          Could my bank stop offering virtual cards?                              
          Yes, nothing is guaranteed, and some banks stopped offering virtual cards a few years back based on lack of
          customer demand and the availability of other payment options that are also considered safe, such as digital
          wallets. But industry professionals don't think virtual cards are going away -- and some banks may even
          decide to add the option, depending on customer demand and fraud trends.
          Banks "have to offer the same services and conveniences that digital wallets and digital-payment
          mechanisms provide," says Ari Lightman, professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon
          University's Heinz College. Banks "don't want to be relegated to being a dumb pipe," where they simply move
          money but don't acquire any of the important customer data, he says.    
          How are banks making virtual cards easier to use?                       
                                                                                  
          Some card companies are starting to offer an option that "might bring virtual cards back to the forefront," says
          Odysseas Papadimitriou, CEO of WalletHub, which tracks credit-card trends.
          Capital One users have the option to get virtual-card numbers by using Eno, its 24/7 virtual assistant.
          Customers add the Eno browser extension and the assistant generates virtual-card numbers when it is time
          to pay. The only thing users need to do is fill in the shipping and billing information. Eno automatically saves
          virtual-card numbers for each merchant so they can be used again.       
          Some consumers may prefer using virtual cards in this manner since it is more seamless than logging into an
          account each time they want to make a purchase. They should, however, be sure their devices remain secure
          to mitigate the chance of unauthorized purchases.                       
          "This type of application for the virtual card has a bright future," Papadimitriou says.
