          House Panel Subpoenas BlackRock, State Street                           
          The House Judiciary Committee said it had subpoenaed BlackRock Inc. and State Street Corp. in its
          environmental, social and governance investigation.                     
                                                                                  
          BlackRock already drew scrutiny from a House committee in August that the New York-based asset manager
          was facilitating investments into blacklisted Chinese companies. BlackRock and State Street did not
          immediately respond to requests for comment.                            
          House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan earlier sent a subpoena to asset manager Vanguard, and the company
          said it was ''committed to working constructively with lawmakers and has cooperated with the committee's
          requests, including producing tens of thousands of pages of relevant documents to date.''
          Bloomberg News, which first reported the development, said the panel is looking into allegations that the
          firms colluded in committing to make the investments. REUTERS
