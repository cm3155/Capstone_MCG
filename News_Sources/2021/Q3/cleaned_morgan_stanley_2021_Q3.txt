          Medical startup ZocDoc Inc. named Edward Liu, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker, as its new chief
          financial officer as it looks to grow its business.                     
          Mr. Liu served as co-head of technology banking for the Americas at Morgan Stanley for about five years
          before joining ZocDoc on Monday. In his new role, he succeeds Netta Samroengraja, who was CFO of the
          New York-based company for 11 years. She is moving into a newly created role of chief corporate
          development officer, the company said.                                  
          Mr. Liu during his tenure at Morgan Stanley advised a number of tech and e-commerce companies on their
          public listings, including online pet-supply store Chewy Inc. in 2019. He also advised software company Red
          Hat on its $34 billion sale to International Business Machines Corp. that same year. In 2015, he advised
          ZocDoc on a funding round.

          Morgan Stanley said Thursday that second-quarter profit rose 10% from a year earlier, thanks to a boost in
          fees from deal making and advising wealthy clients.                     
          The New York-based bank reported profit of $3.51 billion, or $1.85 a share, on revenue of $14.76 billion. That
          exceeded the consensus estimates of analysts polled by FactSet of per-share earnings of $1.66 on revenue
          of $13.97 billion.                                                      
          Like the other big banks that reported earnings this week, Morgan Stanley delivered strong results across
          several business lines on the back of corporate America's rapid rebound this spring. Yet calmer markets,
          especially compared with the frenzied second quarter of 2020, damped trading revenue, albeit to levels that
          are still high by historical standards.                                 
          At Morgan Stanley, investment-banking revenue increased 16% to $2.38 billion, driven by a 44% rise in fees
          on advising on mergers. Morgan Stanley's investment bankers in Europe and Asia had their best period in
          more than a decade, and deal activity was higher across a variety of industries including technology,
          healthcare, financial services and real estate.                         
          Revenue at Morgan Stanley's wealth-management division increased 30% to $6.1 billion. The bank attracted
          $71 billion in net new assets, more than triple last year's second quarter. Growth came from do-it-yourself
          investors that use the bank's E*Trade brokerage, clients of Morgan Stanley's financial advisers and
          employees of companies where Morgan Stanley administers stock plans, a business bolstered by two recent
          acquisitions.                                                           
          "We kind of are creating -- not to be arrogant about it -- but a new mousetrap," Chief Executive James
          Gorman said on a conference call with analysts. "Every now and then in business you look and you sort of
          see a wave coming and you catch the wave, and it's a beautiful thing."  
          Meanwhile, trading revenue fell 20% to $4.51 billion, thanks to a 45% drop in bond-trading revenue, partially
          offset by a 8% increase in stock-trading revenue. That caused overall revenue in its institutional securities
          division to decline by 14%.                                             
          Trading activity among individual investors at Morgan Stanley's E*Trade unit helped offset some of the
          pullback in activity among big money managers. The number of retail-trading clients at Morgan Stanley
          increased 3% over the course of the second quarter to 7.4 million and the average daily number of retail
          trades the company handled for the quarter exceeded 1 million.          
          Retail-trading levels declined about 36% from the first quarter at the height of meme-stock mania but are still
          above their full-year 2020 averages, said Sharon Yeshaya, Morgan Stanley's new finance chief.
          At Morgan Stanley's investment-management division, revenue nearly doubled, helped by the recent
          acquisition of Eaton Vance Corp.                                        
                                                                                  
          Unlike other banks that have reported weak demand for loans among their consumer and commercial clients,
          Morgan Stanley boosted lending by 21% to $320 billion outstanding. The volume of loans backed by clients'
          securities portfolios and other collateral, a popular product among rich Americans, expanded 43% to $75.8
          billion.                                                                
          Operating expenses increased 12% to $10.12 billion thanks in part to a 6% increase in compensation and
          benefits. Morgan Stanley's second-quarter compensation expense of $6.42 billion was 44% of revenue, a
          similar ratio from a year earlier.                                      
          Morgan Stanley's return on tangible equity, a measure of how profitably it puts shareholders' money to use,
          was 18.6% on an annualized basis for the quarter. That is above the bank's long-term profitability target.
          Shares in Morgan Stanley are up 35% since the start of 2021 and hit an all-time high of $93.96 last month. It
          recently announced plans to double its quarterly dividend and buy back up to $12 billion of stock in the
          following year.                                                         
          Shareholders deserve a higher dividend because Morgan Stanley's earnings have become more predictable,
          especially in wealth and investment management, Mr. Gorman said.
