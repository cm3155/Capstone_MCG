          LONDON -- The founder of Greensill Capital spoke frequently about disrupting big banks. But before the
          financial startup collapsed this month, it relied on the apparatus of Wall Street to fuel its expansion.
          Greensill's closest Wall Street relationship was with Credit Suisse Group AG, which provided it financing
          through $10 billion of investment funds. But a clutch of other big players -- including Citigroup Inc., Morgan
          Stanley, Ernst & Young, and Moody's Investors Service -- played key roles in Greensill's rise.

          Greensill also leaned on Morgan Stanley, which for several years acted as an intermediary between Greensill
          and the investors in the notes. These included funds at Credit Suisse and Swiss asset manager GAM Holding
          AG, according to people familiar with the funds and the Greensill marketing document reviewed by the
          Journal.                                                                
          Morgan Stanley provided the funds with information about the notes, including pricing and duration of the
          underlying loans, and placed the notes with the funds for a fee, the people said.

          Morgan Stanley also helped Greensill's biggest client in 2019, when GAM shut a fund that had been an
          important source of financing for Greensill. Some of the assets in the GAM fund were tied to businesses
          owned by U.K. steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta.                              
          Morgan Stanley used a special-purpose vehicle to repackage about GBP 220 million, equivalent to $300
          million, of Greensill-arranged bonds related to Mr. Gupta's businesses held in the GAM funds. Morgan
          Stanley then sold them to its clients, according to some of the people familiar with the funds.
