          BlackRock Inc. is pulling some $2 trillion of assets out of State Street Corp.'s safekeeping, a move that will
          reduce the investing firm's reliance on a small number of parties and lower the fees it pays for back-office
          work.                                                                   
          For more than a decade, State Street served as the sole custodian to BlackRock's U.S. exchange-traded
          funds -- low-cost investment vehicles that have exploded in popularity in recent years. State Street services
          all of the roughly $2.3 trillion across those BlackRock funds.          
          While custody work often involves staid tasks such as maintaining investment records and handling and
          valuing assets, it is crucial to the smooth functioning of Wall Street and its multitrillion-dollar ETF machine.
          Traders, pensions and central banks depend on ETFs to invest across stock and bond markets.
          BlackRock, the world's largest ETF manager, is shifting some of the administrative and accounting tasks
          State Street had performed to Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp.
                                                                                  
          The decision reflects both the market power BlackRock wields as the world's largest money manager and the
          fierce competition among the coterie of banks that vie for investment firms' servicing business. Custody banks
          have often fought for clients by cutting the fees they charge, a price war that has crimped profit margins. The
          shift to lower-cost investments has raised the fee pressure on money managers.
          State Street warned its investors earlier this year that the move was coming. The portion of BlackRock's ETF
          business it expected to lose accounted for about 1.5% of its 2020 fee revenue, or $140 million, the bank's
          executives have said. That figure includes losses from BlackRock's Irish ETF business. The money manager
          is weighing custody bids for those funds.                               
          State Street will continue to play a critical role going forward as a long-term partner to BlackRock's ETF
          business and the firm, State Street said. "Beyond ETFs, State Street continues to be a critical service
          provider to a diverse set of BlackRock funds," the custody bank said.   
          Derek Stein, BlackRock's global head of technology and operations, said the changes allow the ETF
          business to grow further and "mitigate concentration risk."             
          By parceling out the U.S. ETF business to three other custodians, BlackRock will lower the fees it pays for the
          work they provide.
