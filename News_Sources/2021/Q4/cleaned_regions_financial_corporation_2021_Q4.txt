          Among a group of bigger banks tracked by analysts at Jefferies, the median contribution was just 1.4% in the
          third quarter of this year. The contribution ranged from Regions Financial at 4.6% to zero at a handful of
          banks, according to Jefferies. News of a bank doing away with such fees doesn't typically merit much stock
          reaction. A day after Capital One Financial last week said it was ditching overdraft and nonsufficient-fund
          fees, the stock rallied along with the sector.                          
          Regions has outperformed S&P 500 banks overall so far this year amid growth across its businesses. The
          Birmingham, Ala.-based bank has been guiding for service charges overall to decline, expecting them to be
          10% to 15% below 2019 levels for the foreseeable future. The bank has attributed this to a number of
          measures, such as adding more balance alerts and moving to process account transactions in real time, as
          well as relatively high customer balances. It also recently launched a checking account that doesn't incur
          overdraft or nonsufficient-fund fees.
