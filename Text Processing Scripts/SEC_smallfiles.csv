Recent events impacting the financial services industry could adversely affect BOK Financial ' s business. 

Recent events affecting the financial services industry have generated significant market volatility among publicly traded bank holding companies with particular focus on regional banks. These events occurred following a period of rapidly rising interest rates, which resulted in unrealized losses in longer duration securities and loans held by banks as well as more competition for bank deposits. These recent events have, and may continue to, adversely impact the market price and volatility of the Company&#8217;s stock. Potentially adverse changes to laws or regulations governing banks and bank holding companies may occur, including but not limited to, increased regulatory scrutiny in the course of routine examinations or otherwise and new regulations directed towards banks of similar size, which could increase the costs of doing business. In addition, the cost of resolving the recent bank failures may prompt the FDIC to increase its premiums above the recently increased levels or to issue additional special assessments, which could result in higher costs.

During the first three months of 2020 , there have been no material changes to the risk factors in Part I &#8211; Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors in the 2019 Form 10-K except as described below. The risk factor described below updates, and should be read together with, the risk factors disclosed in Part I &#8211; Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors, in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The challenging economic environment triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and will continue to impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

The COVID&#8209;19 pandemic has adversely impacted the economic environment, leading to lower interest rates across the curve, lower equity market valuations and heightened volatility in the financial markets. These developments have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees. Additionally, in March 2020, we experienced a significant increase in client cash balances held at our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, which caused our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio to decline and is likely to cause the ratio to further decline into the buffer we maintain between our long-term operating objective and our regulatory requirement. Furthermore, many of our employees and those of our outsourced service providers are subject to &#8220;shelter-in-place&#8221; restrictions. Certain of our client service response and processing times have increased as a result of very high levels of client engagement, our employees working remotely, and the temporary loss of services from some of our outsourced service providers. Credit markets have been adversely impacted due to both uncertainty regarding the pandemic&#8217;s economic impact and the anticipation that high levels of unemployment will have a significant impact on retail credit and commercial real estate forbearances and delinquencies. We may experience higher levels of delinquencies on our portfolios of first mortgages and home equity lines of credit. We may also experience higher credit spreads in certain sectors within our portfolio of investment securities, especially those asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities with exposure to retail loans and commercial real estate. These and other impacts of the COVID&#8209;19 pandemic could have the effects of heightening many of the other risks described in the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 incorporated by reference herein. The extent to which the COVID&#8209;19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities to contain the financial and economic impact of the pandemic and the spread of COVID&#8209;19, further changes in credit quality and spreads, and reactions in the financial markets.

A continuation of recent turmoil in our industry, and responsive measures to manage it, could have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 

In recent months, several financial services institutions have failed or required outside liquidity support&#8212;in many cases, as a result of the inability of the institutions to obtain needed liquidity. The impact of this situation has led to risk of additional stress to other financial services institutions and the financial services industry generally as a result of increased lack of confidence in the financial sector. U.S. and international regulators have taken action in an effort to strengthen public confidence in the banking system, including the creation of a new Bank Term Funding Program and international coordination to enhance the provision of liquidity via the standing U.S. dollar liquidity swap line arrangements. There can be no assurance that these actions will stabilize the financial services industry and financial markets. While we currently do not anticipate liquidity constraints of the kind that caused certain other financial services institutions to fail or require external support, constraints on our liquidity could occur as a result of unanticipated deposit withdrawals because of market distress or our inability to access other sources of liquidity, including through the capital markets due to unforeseen market dislocations or interruptions. Moreover, some of our customers may become less willing to maintain deposits at PNC because of broader market concerns with the level of insurance available on those deposits. Our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by continued soundness concerns regarding financial institutions generally and our counterparties specifically and limitations resulting from further governmental action in an effort to stabilize or provide additional regulation of the financial system as well as the impact of excessive deposit withdrawals.

Our financial results and condition may be adversely impacted by recent events in the banking industry or any future similar events. 

Recent events impacting the banking industry, including the bank failures in March and April 2023, have resulted in significant disruption and volatility in the capital markets, reduced current valuations of bank securities, and decreased confidence in banks among depositors and other counterparties as well as investors. These events occurred in the context of rapidly rising interest rates which, among other things, have resulted in unrealized losses in longer duration debt securities and loans held by banks, increased competition for deposits and potentially increased the risk of recession. These events have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. 

While the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC took steps to ensure that depositors of recently failed banks would have access to their insured and uninsured deposits, and to facilitate sales of certain failed banks, there is no assurance that these or similar actions will restore customer confidence in the banking system, and we may be further impacted by concerns regarding the soundness of other financial institutions, or other future bank failures or disruptions. Any loss of client deposits or changes in our credit ratings could increase the cost of funding, limit access to capital markets or negatively impact our overall liquidity or capitalization. The cost of resolving the recent bank failures may also prompt the FDIC to increase its premiums above current levels or to issue additional special assessments. 

These recent events and any future similar events may also result in changes to laws or regulations governing bank holding companies and banks, including higher capital requirements, or the imposition of restrictions through supervisory or enforcement activities, which could materially impact our business.

Recent events impacting the financial services industry could adversely affect BOK Financial ' s business. 

Recent events affecting the financial services industry have generated significant market volatility among publicly traded bank holding companies with particular focus on regional banks. These events occurred following a period of rapidly rising interest rates, which resulted in unrealized losses in longer duration securities and loans held by banks as well as more competition for bank deposits. These recent events have, and may continue to, adversely impact the market price and volatility of the Company&#8217;s stock. Potentially adverse changes to laws or regulations governing banks and bank holding companies may occur, including but not limited to, increased regulatory scrutiny in the course of routine examinations or otherwise and new regulations directed towards banks of similar size, which could increase the costs of doing business. In addition, the cost of resolving the recent bank failures may prompt the FDIC to increase its premiums above the recently increased levels or to issue additional special assessments, which could result in higher costs.

During the first three months of 2020 , there have been no material changes to the risk factors in Part I &#8211; Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors in the 2019 Form 10-K except as described below. The risk factor described below updates, and should be read together with, the risk factors disclosed in Part I &#8211; Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors, in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The challenging economic environment triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and will continue to impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

The COVID&#8209;19 pandemic has adversely impacted the economic environment, leading to lower interest rates across the curve, lower equity market valuations and heightened volatility in the financial markets. These developments have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees. Additionally, in March 2020, we experienced a significant increase in client cash balances held at our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, which caused our Tier 1 Leverage Ratio to decline and is likely to cause the ratio to further decline into the buffer we maintain between our long-term operating objective and our regulatory requirement. Furthermore, many of our employees and those of our outsourced service providers are subject to &#8220;shelter-in-place&#8221; restrictions. Certain of our client service response and processing times have increased as a result of very high levels of client engagement, our employees working remotely, and the temporary loss of services from some of our outsourced service providers. Credit markets have been adversely impacted due to both uncertainty regarding the pandemic&#8217;s economic impact and the anticipation that high levels of unemployment will have a significant impact on retail credit and commercial real estate forbearances and delinquencies. We may experience higher levels of delinquencies on our portfolios of first mortgages and home equity lines of credit. We may also experience higher credit spreads in certain sectors within our portfolio of investment securities, especially those asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities with exposure to retail loans and commercial real estate. These and other impacts of the COVID&#8209;19 pandemic could have the effects of heightening many of the other risks described in the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 incorporated by reference herein. The extent to which the COVID&#8209;19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities to contain the financial and economic impact of the pandemic and the spread of COVID&#8209;19, further changes in credit quality and spreads, and reactions in the financial markets.

A continuation of recent turmoil in our industry, and responsive measures to manage it, could have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 

In recent months, several financial services institutions have failed or required outside liquidity support&#8212;in many cases, as a result of the inability of the institutions to obtain needed liquidity. The impact of this situation has led to risk of additional stress to other financial services institutions and the financial services industry generally as a result of increased lack of confidence in the financial sector. U.S. and international regulators have taken action in an effort to strengthen public confidence in the banking system, including the creation of a new Bank Term Funding Program and international coordination to enhance the provision of liquidity via the standing U.S. dollar liquidity swap line arrangements. There can be no assurance that these actions will stabilize the financial services industry and financial markets. While we currently do not anticipate liquidity constraints of the kind that caused certain other financial services institutions to fail or require external support, constraints on our liquidity could occur as a result of unanticipated deposit withdrawals because of market distress or our inability to access other sources of liquidity, including through the capital markets due to unforeseen market dislocations or interruptions. Moreover, some of our customers may become less willing to maintain deposits at PNC because of broader market concerns with the level of insurance available on those deposits. Our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by continued soundness concerns regarding financial institutions generally and our counterparties specifically and limitations resulting from further governmental action in an effort to stabilize or provide additional regulation of the financial system as well as the impact of excessive deposit withdrawals.

Our financial results and condition may be adversely impacted by recent events in the banking industry or any future similar events. 

Recent events impacting the banking industry, including the bank failures in March and April 2023, have resulted in significant disruption and volatility in the capital markets, reduced current valuations of bank securities, and decreased confidence in banks among depositors and other counterparties as well as investors. These events occurred in the context of rapidly rising interest rates which, among other things, have resulted in unrealized losses in longer duration debt securities and loans held by banks, increased competition for deposits and potentially increased the risk of recession. These events have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. 

While the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC took steps to ensure that depositors of recently failed banks would have access to their insured and uninsured deposits, and to facilitate sales of certain failed banks, there is no assurance that these or similar actions will restore customer confidence in the banking system, and we may be further impacted by concerns regarding the soundness of other financial institutions, or other future bank failures or disruptions. Any loss of client deposits or changes in our credit ratings could increase the cost of funding, limit access to capital markets or negatively impact our overall liquidity or capitalization. The cost of resolving the recent bank failures may also prompt the FDIC to increase its premiums above current levels or to issue additional special assessments. 

These recent events and any future similar events may also result in changes to laws or regulations governing bank holding companies and banks, including higher capital requirements, or the imposition of restrictions through supervisory or enforcement activities, which could materially impact our business.

Market risk is the potential economic loss resulting from changes in market prices and interest rates. This risk can either result in diminished current fair values of financial instruments or reduced NII in future periods. Changes in fair value that result from movement in market rates cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Therefore, the impact that future changes in market rates will have on the fair values of financial instruments is uncertain. 

As of December 31, 2022, BancShares&#8217; market risk profile had changed since December 31, 2021, primarily due to the CIT Merger.

Market risk is the potential economic loss resulting from changes in market prices and interest rates. This risk can either result in diminished current fair values of financial instruments or reduced NII in future periods. Changes in fair value that result from movement in market rates cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Therefore, the impact that future changes in market rates will have on the fair values of financial instruments is uncertain. 

As of December 31, 2022, BancShares&#8217; market risk profile had changed since December 31, 2021, primarily due to the CIT Merger.

We are including the following new risk factor which should be read in conjunction with our risk factors provided in Part I, Item 1A of our 2019 10-K: 

The COVID-19 pandemic creates significant risks and uncertainties for our business. 

The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (&#8216;&#8216;COVID-19&#8217;&#8217;) pandemic creates significant and pervasive societal, economic and market disruption globally. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition will depend on future developments. These developments are highly uncertain, including the scope, duration and severity of the pandemic, the effectiveness of our remote working and virtual meeting arrangements and staffing levels, the measures that may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak (such as stimulus, quarantines and travel restrictions, effectiveness of health care, and new or interim regulation), the actions of other third parties in response to the pandemic, and the possible further impacts on the global economy. Given the uncertainty of future developments, we seek to manage our risks effectively, but our ability to do so is subject to the inherent limitations of obtaining timely, reliable analysis and information in a situation that continues to develop. 

Towards the end of the first quarter of 2020 and into April 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted each of our business segments and impacts would likely be experienced in future quarters if conditions persist. Consumer demand, our fee and investment income, our owned asset values, and our credit reserve and other financial or actuarial assumptions and reserve calculations have been (and may further be) negatively impacted from a decline and volatility of asset prices, reduction in interest rates, widening of credit spreads, credit deterioration, decreased liquidity in trading markets and other economic and market effects of the global pandemic. Should these conditions be prolonged or worsen for an extended time period, we could experience volatility and uncertainty in volumes, uncertainty in availability and price levels of financial assets and hedges, reduced client activity and fees, increased mortality and morbidity in our insurance policyholder base, increase constraints and costs of capital, possible impacts to our credit ratings and other negative impacts on our financial position. 

The COVID 19 pandemic may also affect the ability of our suppliers, distributors, vendors, reinsurers and other counterparties to provide products and services and otherwise fulfill their commitments to us. In addition, the market and economic uncertainty and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will heighten the other risks described in the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K.

The following risk factors supplement the Risk Factors described in the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and should be read in conjunction therewith 

Changes in the federal, state, or local tax laws may negatively impact our financial performance. On March 31, 2021, President Biden unveiled his infrastructure plan, which includes a proposal to increase the federal corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% as part of a package of tax reforms to help fund the spending proposals in the plan. The Biden plan is in the early stages of the legislative process, which is expected to proceed this year due to the Democratic Party's majority in both houses of Congress. If adopted as proposed, the increase of the corporate tax rate would adversely affect our results of operations in future periods.

Risks Related to our Business 

Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine may adversely affect us and create significant risks and uncertainties for our business, with the ultimate impact dependent on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable. 

Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine has negatively impacted the global and U.S. economies including supply chain disruptions, rising prices for oil and other commodities, volatility in capital markets and foreign currency exchange rates, rising interest rates and heightened cybersecurity risks. The extent to which the invasion adversely affects our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our liquidity and regulatory capital ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including the extent and duration of the invasion and economic sanctions imposed on Russia, and the immeasurable humanitarian toll inflicted on Ukraine. If the invasion adversely affects us, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks related to our business.

Risk Factors (Item 1A) 

The following is a change to the risk factors as previously disclosed in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 as updated by the Bancorp&#8217;s subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q: 

Recent bank failures have created significant market volatility and regulatory uncertainty which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

In response to recent bank failures, the United States government, particularly the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC and/or the U.S. Congress, is expected to adopt a variety of measures and new regulations designed to strengthen capital and liquidity standards and otherwise restore confidence in financial institutions. These reforms are expected to modify liquidity, long-term debt, and capital requirements and enhance existing stress testing frameworks as well as include special assessments to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund. 

Even without revisions to the regulatory framework, an enhanced level of scrutiny and escalation from our regulators could negatively impact our business activities as our regulators perform reviews of, among other things, our liquidity, capital, stress testing and risk management programs and may require us to enhance our liquidity position and take other steps regarding risk management. Under applicable banking laws such regulatory actions may not be disclosed to the public. 

These actions could limit our business activities (including lending) and our ability to expand organically or through acquisitions. They could also result in our taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders. 

In the current environment, we may also experience deposit volatility as customers react to adverse events impacting the banking industry in general or other specific institutions. As deposits remain our primary source of funding, we may be unable to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet our commitments, including commitments to depositors withdrawing funds, or be required to raise deposit interest rates which would adversely impact our net interest margin. Our failure to effectively manage and maintain adequate liquidity to satisfy our commitments would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Changes from previous risk factor disclosures: 

The following updates and restates the third highlighted topic under ""Operational Risks"" within Item 1A of FHN's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which appeared on page 30 of that report. 

An information technology security (cybersecurity) breach or other incident can cause significant damage, and can be difficult to detect even after it occurs. Among other things, that damage can occur due to outright theft, loss or extortion of our funds or our clients&#8217; funds, fraud or identity theft perpetrated on clients, loss of confidential or proprietary information, business disruption, or adverse publicity associated with a breach or incident and its potential effects. Perpetrators potentially can be associates, clients, and certain vendors, all of whom legitimately have access to some portion of our systems, as well as outsiders with no legitimate access. For example, in April 2021 we experienced a data security incident affecting a small number of client accounts. An unauthorized party gained access to certain client login credentials from an unknown source. Using those credentials and exploiting a vulnerability in third-party security software, the unauthorized party was able to fraudulently obtain funds from client accounts. Although our monetary loss from that incident was minimal, the incident illustrates that we are at risk for vulnerabilities not fully within our control, in this case related to third-party software and client credentials. 

Because of the potential for very serious consequences associated with these risks, our electronic systems and their upgrades need to address internal and external security concerns to a high degree, and our systems must comply with applicable banking and other regulations pertaining to bank safety and client protection. Although many of our defenses are systemic and highly technical, others are much older and more basic. For example, periodically we train all our associates to recognize red flags associated with fraud, theft, and other electronic crimes, and we educate our clients as well through regular and episodic security-oriented communications. We expect our systems and regulatory requirements to continue to evolve as technology and criminal techniques also continue to evolve.

Instability in global economic conditions and geopolitical matters, as well as volatility in financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. The macroeconomic environment in the United States is susceptible to global events and volatility in financial markets. For example, trade negotiations between the U.S. and other nations remain uncertain and could adversely impact economic and market conditions for the Company and its clients and counterparties. In addition, global demand for products may exceed supply during the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, and such shortages may cause inflation, adversely impact consumer and business confidence, and adversely affect the economy as well as the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results.

JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of First Republic Bank may not result in all of the benefits anticipated. 

On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. acquired the substantial majority of assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank from the FDIC (the &#8220;Acquisition&#8221;). There can be no assurance that the Acquisition will have the anticipated positive results, including with respect to: 

&#8226; the total cost of integration 

&#8226; the time required to complete the integration 

&#8226; the amount of longer-term cost savings 

&#8226; the overall performance of the assets and liabilities acquired in the Acquisition, or 

&#8226; an improved price for JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s common stock. 

Integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly, and typically will involve the combination of relevant accounting and data processing systems and management controls, as well as managing relevant relationships with employees, clients, suppliers and other business partners. Integration efforts could divert management attention and resources, which could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s operations or results. In addition, JPMorgan Chase could incur unanticipated costs or losses in connection with the Acquisition and its integration efforts. 

Acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause JPMorgan Chase to lose clients and customers, or cause clients and customers to move their business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the integration process could result in the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees. In addition, the loss of key employees in connection with the Acquisition could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s ability to successfully conduct its business.

Our participation in the Paycheck Protection Program may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny or litigation and could result in damage to our reputation. 

We provided $8 billion in funding and were the seventh overall lender in the PPP. The PPP and many lenders that participated in the PPP have been the subject of much publicity and regular media stories. There have been lawsuits by borrowers and purported agents against lenders related to the program, and we have been the subject of litigation related to the PPP. Although such litigation has not been material to date, our participation in the program could result in increased exposure to litigation in the future. In addition, our practices and procedures related to the PPP could be scrutinized by government or regulatory agencies. Government or regulatory scrutiny or increased litigation could result in financial liability or damage to our reputation. This could also result in increased legal and compliance costs.

Labor shortages and constraints in the supply chain could adversely affect our clients&#8217; operations as well as our operations. 

Many sectors in the United States and around the world are experiencing a shortage of workers. The shortage of workers is exacerbating supply chain disruptions around the world, causing certain industries to struggle to regain momentum due to a lack of workers or materials. Our commercial clients may be impacted by the shortage of workers and constraints in the supply chain, which could adversely impact our clients&#8217; operations. Clients may experience disruptions in their operations, which could lead to reduced cash flow and difficulty in making loan repayments. The financial services industry has also been affected by the shortage of workers, and Key has experienced the war for talent that is currently underway in the financial services industry. This may lead to open positions remaining unfilled for longer periods of time or a need to increase wages to attract workers. We have had to recently increase wages in certain positions to attract talent, particularly in entry-level type positions and certain specialty areas. Please also see the risk factor entitled &#8220;We may not be able to attract and retain skilled people&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 37 of our 2020 Form 10-K.

The additional risk factor set forth below discusses new material risks that have become applicable since the filing of our 2022 Form 10-K. 

Recent bank failures have created significant market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and decreased confidence in the U.S. banking system. 

The failures of Silicon Valley Bank (&#8220;SVB&#8221;) and Signature Bank (&#8220;Signature) in March 2023, followed by the failure of First Republic Bank in May 2023, have caused significant market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and decreased confidence in the U.S. banking system. The recent bank failures occurred during a period of rapidly rising interest rates which, among other things, has resulted in unrealized losses in longer duration securities and more competition for bank deposits, and may increase the risk of a potential economic recession in the United States. Given the current environment, we may experience more deposit volatility as customers react to adverse events or market speculation involving financial institutions. 

Ratings agencies have also reacted to recent events by issuing updated ratings and assessments. On April 21, 2023, Moody&#8217;s lowered the macro profile of the U.S. banking system reflecting general concern around the banking industry as a whole. Moody&#8217;s also changed the credit ratings, or outlooks, for 20 U.S. banks, including Key. Moody&#8217;s affirmed all long-term and short-term ratings and assessments of KeyCorp and KeyBank, while changing KeyCorp and KeyBank&#8217;s rating outlook from &#8220;stable&#8221; to &#8220;negative&#8221; related to uncertainty in the banking industry following the recent bank failures. Our ratings are subject to further adjustments based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings as well as factors not entirely within our control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. 

In response to the bank failures, the United States government may adopt a variety of measures and new regulations designed to strengthen capital levels, liquidity standards, and risk management practices and otherwise restore confidence in financial institutions. Any reforms, if adopted, could have a significant impact on banks and BHCs, including Key. We may also be subject to any special assessment that the FDIC adopts to recover the loss to the DIF arising from the use of the systemic risk exception with respect to SVB and Signature Bank which assessment, if significant, could have a material impact to our results of operations.

Our business, results of operations, and financial condition have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and governmental and societal responses thereto, have had a severe impact on recent global economic and market conditions, including significant disruption of, and volatility in, financial markets; global supply chain disruptions; and the institution of social distancing and shelter-in-place requirements that have resulted in temporary closures of many businesses, lost revenues, and increased unemployment. 

These conditions have impacted- or are expected in the future to impact-our business, results of operations, and financial condition negatively, including through lower revenue from certain of our fee-based businesses; lower net interest income resulting from lower interest rates; increased provisions for credit losses; impairments on the securities we hold; and decreased demand for certain of our products and services. Additionally, our liquidity and regulatory capital could be adversely impacted by volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets; volatility in foreign exchange rates; deposit flows; and continued client draws on lines of credit. Our business operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic. 

While governmental authorities have taken unprecedented measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses, stabilize the markets, and support economic growth, the success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to mitigate fully the negative impact of the ongoing pandemic. Further, some measures, such as a suspension of mortgage and other loan payments and foreclosures, may have a negative impact on our business, while our participation in other measures could result in reputational harm, litigation, or regulatory and government actions, proceedings, or penalties. 

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. The ongoing pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

&#8203; 

Investing in shares of our common stock involves certain risks, including those identified and described in Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, as well as cautionary statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including those under the caption &#8220;Cautionary Note Regarding Any Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; set forth in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, risks and matters described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other filings with the SEC.

&#8203; 

The Company is providing this additional risk factor to supplement the risk factors contained in Item 1A of our

Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.

&#8203; 

Changes to or the application of incorrect assumptions, estimates, or judgements in our financial statements could 

cause significant unexpected losses or impacts in the future 

&#8203; 

For example, the CECL standard, as of January 1, 2020, requires that we provide reserves for a current

estimate of lifetime expected credit losses for our loan portfolios and other financial assets, if applicable, at the time

those assets are acquired or originated. This estimate is adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit 

losses. Our allowance for credit losses estimate depends upon the CECL models and assumptions and forecasted 

&#160; 

macroeconomic conditions, including, among other things, the South Atlantic unemployment rate, and the credit indicators, composition, and other characteristics of our loan and other applicable portfolios. These model assumptions and forecasted macroeconomic conditions will change over time, whether due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors, resulting in greater variability in our ACL compared to its provision for loan losses under the previous GAAP methodology, and thus, will impact operations, as well as regulatory capital, including as the CECL phase-in begins as of January 1, 2022.

We are including the following new risk factor which should be read in conjunction with our risk factors provided in Part I, Item 1A of our 2019 10-K: 

The COVID-19 pandemic creates significant risks and uncertainties for our business. 

The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (&#8216;&#8216;COVID-19&#8217;&#8217;) pandemic creates significant and pervasive societal, economic and market disruption globally. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition will depend on future developments. These developments are highly uncertain, including the scope, duration and severity of the pandemic, the effectiveness of our remote working and virtual meeting arrangements and staffing levels, the measures that may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak (such as stimulus, quarantines and travel restrictions, effectiveness of health care, and new or interim regulation), the actions of other third parties in response to the pandemic, and the possible further impacts on the global economy. Given the uncertainty of future developments, we seek to manage our risks effectively, but our ability to do so is subject to the inherent limitations of obtaining timely, reliable analysis and information in a situation that continues to develop. 

Towards the end of the first quarter of 2020 and into April 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted each of our business segments and impacts would likely be experienced in future quarters if conditions persist. Consumer demand, our fee and investment income, our owned asset values, and our credit reserve and other financial or actuarial assumptions and reserve calculations have been (and may further be) negatively impacted from a decline and volatility of asset prices, reduction in interest rates, widening of credit spreads, credit deterioration, decreased liquidity in trading markets and other economic and market effects of the global pandemic. Should these conditions be prolonged or worsen for an extended time period, we could experience volatility and uncertainty in volumes, uncertainty in availability and price levels of financial assets and hedges, reduced client activity and fees, increased mortality and morbidity in our insurance policyholder base, increase constraints and costs of capital, possible impacts to our credit ratings and other negative impacts on our financial position. 

The COVID 19 pandemic may also affect the ability of our suppliers, distributors, vendors, reinsurers and other counterparties to provide products and services and otherwise fulfill their commitments to us. In addition, the market and economic uncertainty and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will heighten the other risks described in the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K.

The following risk factors supplement the Risk Factors described in the Corporation&#8217;s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and should be read in conjunction therewith 

Changes in the federal, state, or local tax laws may negatively impact our financial performance. On March 31, 2021, President Biden unveiled his infrastructure plan, which includes a proposal to increase the federal corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% as part of a package of tax reforms to help fund the spending proposals in the plan. The Biden plan is in the early stages of the legislative process, which is expected to proceed this year due to the Democratic Party's majority in both houses of Congress. If adopted as proposed, the increase of the corporate tax rate would adversely affect our results of operations in future periods.

Risks Related to our Business 

Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine may adversely affect us and create significant risks and uncertainties for our business, with the ultimate impact dependent on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable. 

Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine has negatively impacted the global and U.S. economies including supply chain disruptions, rising prices for oil and other commodities, volatility in capital markets and foreign currency exchange rates, rising interest rates and heightened cybersecurity risks. The extent to which the invasion adversely affects our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our liquidity and regulatory capital ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, including the extent and duration of the invasion and economic sanctions imposed on Russia, and the immeasurable humanitarian toll inflicted on Ukraine. If the invasion adversely affects us, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks related to our business.

Risk Factors (Item 1A) 

The following is a change to the risk factors as previously disclosed in the Bancorp&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 as updated by the Bancorp&#8217;s subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q: 

Recent bank failures have created significant market volatility and regulatory uncertainty which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

In response to recent bank failures, the United States government, particularly the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC and/or the U.S. Congress, is expected to adopt a variety of measures and new regulations designed to strengthen capital and liquidity standards and otherwise restore confidence in financial institutions. These reforms are expected to modify liquidity, long-term debt, and capital requirements and enhance existing stress testing frameworks as well as include special assessments to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund. 

Even without revisions to the regulatory framework, an enhanced level of scrutiny and escalation from our regulators could negatively impact our business activities as our regulators perform reviews of, among other things, our liquidity, capital, stress testing and risk management programs and may require us to enhance our liquidity position and take other steps regarding risk management. Under applicable banking laws such regulatory actions may not be disclosed to the public. 

These actions could limit our business activities (including lending) and our ability to expand organically or through acquisitions. They could also result in our taking steps to increase our capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders. 

In the current environment, we may also experience deposit volatility as customers react to adverse events impacting the banking industry in general or other specific institutions. As deposits remain our primary source of funding, we may be unable to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet our commitments, including commitments to depositors withdrawing funds, or be required to raise deposit interest rates which would adversely impact our net interest margin. Our failure to effectively manage and maintain adequate liquidity to satisfy our commitments would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Changes from previous risk factor disclosures: 

The following updates and restates the third highlighted topic under ""Operational Risks"" within Item 1A of FHN's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which appeared on page 30 of that report. 

An information technology security (cybersecurity) breach or other incident can cause significant damage, and can be difficult to detect even after it occurs. Among other things, that damage can occur due to outright theft, loss or extortion of our funds or our clients&#8217; funds, fraud or identity theft perpetrated on clients, loss of confidential or proprietary information, business disruption, or adverse publicity associated with a breach or incident and its potential effects. Perpetrators potentially can be associates, clients, and certain vendors, all of whom legitimately have access to some portion of our systems, as well as outsiders with no legitimate access. For example, in April 2021 we experienced a data security incident affecting a small number of client accounts. An unauthorized party gained access to certain client login credentials from an unknown source. Using those credentials and exploiting a vulnerability in third-party security software, the unauthorized party was able to fraudulently obtain funds from client accounts. Although our monetary loss from that incident was minimal, the incident illustrates that we are at risk for vulnerabilities not fully within our control, in this case related to third-party software and client credentials. 

Because of the potential for very serious consequences associated with these risks, our electronic systems and their upgrades need to address internal and external security concerns to a high degree, and our systems must comply with applicable banking and other regulations pertaining to bank safety and client protection. Although many of our defenses are systemic and highly technical, others are much older and more basic. For example, periodically we train all our associates to recognize red flags associated with fraud, theft, and other electronic crimes, and we educate our clients as well through regular and episodic security-oriented communications. We expect our systems and regulatory requirements to continue to evolve as technology and criminal techniques also continue to evolve.

Instability in global economic conditions and geopolitical matters, as well as volatility in financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. The macroeconomic environment in the United States is susceptible to global events and volatility in financial markets. For example, trade negotiations between the U.S. and other nations remain uncertain and could adversely impact economic and market conditions for the Company and its clients and counterparties. In addition, global demand for products may exceed supply during the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, and such shortages may cause inflation, adversely impact consumer and business confidence, and adversely affect the economy as well as the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results.

JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of First Republic Bank may not result in all of the benefits anticipated. 

On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. acquired the substantial majority of assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank from the FDIC (the &#8220;Acquisition&#8221;). There can be no assurance that the Acquisition will have the anticipated positive results, including with respect to: 

&#8226; the total cost of integration 

&#8226; the time required to complete the integration 

&#8226; the amount of longer-term cost savings 

&#8226; the overall performance of the assets and liabilities acquired in the Acquisition, or 

&#8226; an improved price for JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s common stock. 

Integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly, and typically will involve the combination of relevant accounting and data processing systems and management controls, as well as managing relevant relationships with employees, clients, suppliers and other business partners. Integration efforts could divert management attention and resources, which could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s operations or results. In addition, JPMorgan Chase could incur unanticipated costs or losses in connection with the Acquisition and its integration efforts. 

Acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause JPMorgan Chase to lose clients and customers, or cause clients and customers to move their business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the integration process could result in the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees. In addition, the loss of key employees in connection with the Acquisition could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s ability to successfully conduct its business.

Our participation in the Paycheck Protection Program may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny or litigation and could result in damage to our reputation. 

We provided $8 billion in funding and were the seventh overall lender in the PPP. The PPP and many lenders that participated in the PPP have been the subject of much publicity and regular media stories. There have been lawsuits by borrowers and purported agents against lenders related to the program, and we have been the subject of litigation related to the PPP. Although such litigation has not been material to date, our participation in the program could result in increased exposure to litigation in the future. In addition, our practices and procedures related to the PPP could be scrutinized by government or regulatory agencies. Government or regulatory scrutiny or increased litigation could result in financial liability or damage to our reputation. This could also result in increased legal and compliance costs.

Labor shortages and constraints in the supply chain could adversely affect our clients&#8217; operations as well as our operations. 

Many sectors in the United States and around the world are experiencing a shortage of workers. The shortage of workers is exacerbating supply chain disruptions around the world, causing certain industries to struggle to regain momentum due to a lack of workers or materials. Our commercial clients may be impacted by the shortage of workers and constraints in the supply chain, which could adversely impact our clients&#8217; operations. Clients may experience disruptions in their operations, which could lead to reduced cash flow and difficulty in making loan repayments. The financial services industry has also been affected by the shortage of workers, and Key has experienced the war for talent that is currently underway in the financial services industry. This may lead to open positions remaining unfilled for longer periods of time or a need to increase wages to attract workers. We have had to recently increase wages in certain positions to attract talent, particularly in entry-level type positions and certain specialty areas. Please also see the risk factor entitled &#8220;We may not be able to attract and retain skilled people&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 37 of our 2020 Form 10-K.

The failures of Silicon Valley Bank (&#8220;SVB&#8221;) and Signature Bank (&#8220;Signature) in March 2023, followed by the failure of First Republic Bank in May 2023, have caused significant market volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and decreased confidence in the U.S. banking system. The recent bank failures occurred during a period of rapidly rising interest rates which, among other things, has resulted in unrealized losses in longer duration securities and more competition for bank deposits, and may increase the risk of a potential economic recession in the United States. Given the current environment, we may experience more deposit volatility as customers react to adverse events or market speculation involving financial institutions. 

Ratings agencies have also reacted to recent events by issuing updated ratings and assessments. On April 21, 2023, Moody&#8217;s lowered the macro profile of the U.S. banking system reflecting general concern around the banking industry as a whole. Moody&#8217;s also changed the credit ratings, or outlooks, for 20 U.S. banks, including Key. Moody&#8217;s affirmed all long-term and short-term ratings and assessments of KeyCorp and KeyBank, while changing KeyCorp and KeyBank&#8217;s rating outlook from &#8220;stable&#8221; to &#8220;negative&#8221; related to uncertainty in the banking industry following the recent bank failures. Our ratings are subject to further adjustments based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings as well as factors not entirely within our control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. 

In response to the bank failures, the United States government may adopt a variety of measures and new regulations designed to strengthen capital levels, liquidity standards, and risk management practices and otherwise restore confidence in financial institutions. Any reforms, if adopted, could have a significant impact on banks and BHCs, including Key. We may also be subject to any special assessment that the FDIC adopts to recover the loss to the DIF arising from the use of the systemic risk exception with respect to SVB and Signature Bank which assessment, if significant, could have a material impact to our results of operations.

Our business, results of operations, and financial condition have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and governmental and societal responses thereto, have had a severe impact on recent global economic and market conditions, including significant disruption of, and volatility in, financial markets; global supply chain disruptions; and the institution of social distancing and shelter-in-place requirements that have resulted in temporary closures of many businesses, lost revenues, and increased unemployment. 

These conditions have impacted- or are expected in the future to impact-our business, results of operations, and financial condition negatively, including through lower revenue from certain of our fee-based businesses; lower net interest income resulting from lower interest rates; increased provisions for credit losses; impairments on the securities we hold; and decreased demand for certain of our products and services. Additionally, our liquidity and regulatory capital could be adversely impacted by volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets; volatility in foreign exchange rates; deposit flows; and continued client draws on lines of credit. Our business operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic. 

While governmental authorities have taken unprecedented measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses, stabilize the markets, and support economic growth, the success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to mitigate fully the negative impact of the ongoing pandemic. Further, some measures, such as a suspension of mortgage and other loan payments and foreclosures, may have a negative impact on our business, while our participation in other measures could result in reputational harm, litigation, or regulatory and government actions, proceedings, or penalties. 

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. The ongoing pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the section entitled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Investing in shares of our common stock involves certain risks, including those identified and described in Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, as well as cautionary statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including those under the caption &#8220;Cautionary Note Regarding Any Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; set forth in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, risks and matters described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other filings with the SEC.

&#8203; 

The Company is providing this additional risk factor to supplement the risk factors contained in Item 1A of our

Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.

&#8203; 

Changes to or the application of incorrect assumptions, estimates, or judgements in our financial statements could 

cause significant unexpected losses or impacts in the future 

&#8203; 

For example, the CECL standard, as of January 1, 2020, requires that we provide reserves for a current

estimate of lifetime expected credit losses for our loan portfolios and other financial assets, if applicable, at the time

those assets are acquired or originated. This estimate is adjusted each period for changes in expected lifetime credit 

losses. Our allowance for credit losses estimate depends upon the CECL models and assumptions and forecasted 

&#160; 

macroeconomic conditions, including, among other things, the South Atlantic unemployment rate, and the credit indicators, composition, and other characteristics of our loan and other applicable portfolios. These model assumptions and forecasted macroeconomic conditions will change over time, whether due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors, resulting in greater variability in our ACL compared to its provision for loan losses under the previous GAAP methodology, and thus, will impact operations, as well as regulatory capital, including as the CECL phase-in begins as of January 1, 2022.
