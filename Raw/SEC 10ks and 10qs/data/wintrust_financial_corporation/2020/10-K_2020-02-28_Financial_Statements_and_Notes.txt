 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Wintrust Financial Corporation 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of condition of Wintrust Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 28, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. 

##TABLE_START Allowance for loan losses 

Description of the Matter 

The Company&#8217;s loan portfolio totaled $26.8 billion as of December 31, 2019, and the associated allowance for loan losses (allowance) was $156.8 million. As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance represents management&#8217;s estimate of the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance is composed of the following components: 1) specific reserves on impaired loans, 2) a general reserve based upon historical loss experience and 3) qualitative factors to adjust the historical loss experience used, if deemed necessary. Such qualitative factors assessed by management include the following: i) an assessment of internally-evaluated problem loans and historical loss experience; ii) changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, changes in historical loss experience; iii) changes in lending policies and procedures, including underwriting standards and collections, charge-off and recovery practices; iv) changes in experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff; v) changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments, including the condition of various market segments; vi) changes in the volume and severity of past due and classified loans and trends in the volume of non-accrual loans, TDRs and other loan modifications; vii) changes in the quality of the Company&#8217;s loan review system; viii) changes in the underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans; and ix) the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the bank&#8217;s existing portfolio. 

Auditing management&#8217;s estimate of the allowance involves a high degree of subjectivity, in particular due to the degree of management judgement involved in evaluating the qualitative factors. Management&#8217;s identification and measurement of the qualitative factors is highly judgmental and could have a significant effect on the allowance. 

How we Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management&#8217;s process for assessing, challenging, and reviewing the need for and measurement of the qualitative factors and controls over the clerical accuracy of the application of the qualitative factors within the allowance. 

To test the qualitative factors used to adjust the historical loss experience, our audit procedures included among others, 1) evaluating the basis of the qualitative factors; 2) testing the completeness and accuracy of information used by management to calculate the qualitative factors by comparing the information to the Company&#8217;s historical performance data and third-party macroeconomic data; and 3) testing that the qualitative factors approved by management were appropriately applied to the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio. In addition, we evaluated the overall allowance amount, inclusive of the adjustments for qualitative factors, and whether the allowance appropriately reflects losses incurred in the loan portfolio as of the consolidated balance sheet date. For example, we compared the overall allowance amount to those established by similar banking institutions with similar loan portfolios.

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The accounting and reporting policies of Wintrust Financial Corporation (&#8220;Wintrust&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) and its subsidiaries conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and prevailing practices of the banking industry. In the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts contained in the consolidated financial statements. Management believes that the estimates made are reasonable; however, changes in estimates may be required if economic or other conditions change beyond management&#8217;s expectations. Reclassifications of certain prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation. The following is a summary of the Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements of Wintrust include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. 

Earnings per Share 

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then share in the earnings of the Company. The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding is increased by the assumed conversion of any outstanding convertible preferred stock shares from the beginning of the year or date of issuance, if later, and the number of common shares that would be issued assuming the exercise of stock options, the issuance of restricted shares and stock warrants using the treasury stock method. The adjustments to the weighted-average common shares outstanding are only made when such adjustments will dilute earnings per common share. Net income applicable to common shares used in the diluted earnings per share calculation can be affected by the conversion of the Company's preferred stock. Where the effect of this conversion would reduce the loss per share or increase the income per share, net income applicable to common shares is not adjusted by the associated preferred dividends. 

Business Combinations 

The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, &#8220;Business Combinations&#8221; (&#8220;ASC 805&#8221;) when it obtains control of a business. When determining whether a business has been acquired, the Company first evaluates whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired are concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If concentrated in such a manner, the set of assets and activities is not a business. If not concentrated in such a manner, the Company assesses whether the set meets the definition of a business by containing inputs, outputs and at least one substantive process. If the set represents a business, the Company recognizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, immediately expenses transaction costs and accounts for restructuring plans separately from the business combination. There is no separate recognition of the acquired allowance for loan losses on the acquirer&#8217;s balance sheet as credit related factors are incorporated directly into the fair value of the loans recorded at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Alternatively, a gain is recorded equal to the amount by which the fair value of assets purchased exceeds the fair value of liabilities assumed and consideration paid. 

If the set of assets and activities do not constitute a business, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. The cost of a group of assets acquired is allocated to the individual assets acquired or liabilities assumed based on the relative fair value and does not result in the recognition of goodwill. Generally, any excess of the cost of the transaction over the fair value of the individual assets acquired or liabilities assumed, or, in contrast, any excess of the fair value of the individual assets acquired or liabilities assumed over the cost of the transaction, should be allocated on a relative fair value basis. Certain "non-qualifying" assets are excluded from this allocation, and are recognized at the individual asset's fair value. 

Results of operations of the acquired business are included in the income statement from the effective date of acquisition. Subsequent adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified in reporting periods after the acquisition date of the business combination and asset acquisitions are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.

Cash Equivalents 

For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, Wintrust considers cash on hand, cash items in the process of collection, non-interest bearing amounts due from correspondent banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements with original maturities of three months or less, to be cash equivalents. 

Investment Securities 

The Company classifies debt and equity securities upon purchase in one of five categories: trading, held-to-maturity debt securities, available-for-sale debt securities, equity securities with a readily determinable fair value or equity securities without a readily determinable fair value. Debt and equity securities held for resale are classified as trading securities. Debt securities for which the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. All other debt securities are classified as available-for-sale as they may be sold prior to maturity in response to changes in the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk profile, funding needs, demand for collateralized deposits by public entities or other reasons. Equity securities are classified based upon whether a readily determinable fair value exists on such security. The fair value of an equity security is readily determinable if it meets certain conditions, including whether sales prices or bid-ask quotes are currently available on certain securities exchanges; traded only in a foreign market that is of a breadth and scope comparable to one of the U.S. markets; or the security is an investment in a mutual fund or similar structure with a fair value per share or unit that is determined and published, and is the basis for current transactions. 

Held-to-maturity debt securities are stated at amortized cost, which represents actual cost adjusted for premium amortization and discount accretion using methods that approximate the effective interest method. Available-for-sale debt securities are stated at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of related taxes, included in shareholders&#8217; equity as a separate component of other comprehensive income. Trading account securities and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are stated at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from sales and fair value adjustments are included in other non-interest income. Equity securities without a readily determinable fair value are stated at either a calculated net asset value per share, if available, or the cost of the security minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar instrument of the same issuer. 

Subsequent to classification at the time of purchase, the Company may transfer debt securities between trading, held-to-maturity, or available-for-sale. For debt securities transferred to trading, the current unrealized gain or loss at the date of transfer, net of related taxes, is immediately recognized in earnings. Debt securities transferred from trading to either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale has already recognized any unrealized gain or loss into earnings and this amount is not reversed. Unrealized gains or losses, net related taxes, for available-for-sale debt securities transferred to held-to-maturity remains as a separate component of other comprehensive income and an offsetting discount included in the amortized cost of the held-to-maturity debt security. These amounts are amortized over the remaining life of the debt security in equal and offsetting amounts. Unrealized gains or losses for held-to-maturity debt securities transferred to available-for-sale are recognized at the transfer date as a separate component of other comprehensive income, net of related taxes. 

Declines in the fair value of held-to-maturity and available-for-sale debt investment securities (with certain exceptions for debt securities noted below) that are deemed to be other-than-temporary are charged to earnings as a realized loss, and a new cost basis for the securities is established. In evaluating other-than-temporary impairment, management considers the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value in the near term. Declines in the fair value of debt securities below amortized cost are deemed to be other-than-temporary in circumstances where: (1) the Company has the intent to sell a security; (2) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security. If the Company intends to sell a debt security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security before recovery, an other-than-temporary impairment write-down is recognized in earnings equal to the difference between the debt security&#8217;s amortized cost basis and its fair value. If an entity does not intend to sell the debt security or it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security before recovery, the other-than-temporary impairment write-down is separated into an amount representing credit loss, which is recognized in earnings, and an amount related to all other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income. 

Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Such investments are included within accrued interest receivable and other assets within the Company's Consolidated Statements of Condition.

##TABLE_END

Interest and dividends, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, are recognized as interest income when earned. Realized gains and losses on sales (using the specific identification method), unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are included in non-interest income. 

FHLB and FRB Stock 

Investments in FHLB and FRB stock are restricted as to redemption and are carried at cost. 

Securities Purchased Under Resale Agreements and Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements 

Securities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold under repurchase agreements are generally treated as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the amount at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. Securities, consisting of U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency and mortgage-backed securities, pledged as collateral under these financing arrangements cannot be sold by the secured party. The fair value of collateral either received from or provided to a third party is monitored and additional collateral is obtained or requested to be returned as deemed appropriate. 

Brokerage Customer Receivables 

The Company, under an agreement with an out-sourced securities clearing firm, extends credit to its brokerage customers to finance their purchases of securities on margin. The Company receives income from interest charged on such extensions of credit. Brokerage customer receivables represent amounts due on margin balances. Securities owned by customers are held as collateral for these receivables. 

Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale 

Mortgage loans are classified as held-for-sale when originated or acquired with the intent to sell the loan into the secondary market. ASC 825, &#8220;Financial Instruments&#8221; provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Mortgage loans classified as held-for-sale are measured at fair value which is determined by reference to investor prices for loan products with similar characteristics. Changes in fair value are recognized in mortgage banking revenue. 

Market conditions or other developments may change management&#8217;s intent with respect to the disposition of these loans and loans previously classified as mortgage loans held-for-sale may be reclassified to the loans held-for-investment portfolio, with the balance transferred continuing to be carried at fair value. 

Loans and Leases, Allowance for Loan Losses, Allowance for Covered Loan Losses and Allowance for Losses on Lending-Related Commitments 

Loans are generally reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income. Interest income is recognized when earned. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and amortized over the expected life of the loan as an adjustment to the yield using methods that approximate the effective interest method. Finance charges on premium finance receivables are earned over the term of the loan, using a method which approximates the effective yield method. 

Leases classified as capital leases are included within lease loans for financial statement purposes. Capital leases are stated as the sum of remaining minimum lease payments from lessees plus estimated residual values less unearned lease income. Unearned lease income on capital leases is recognized over the term of the leases using the effective interest method. 

Interest income is not accrued on loans where management has determined that the borrowers may be unable to meet contractual principal and/or interest obligations, or where interest or principal is 90 days or more past due, unless the loans are adequately secured and in the process of collection. Cash receipts on non-accrual loans are generally applied to the principal balance until the remaining balance is considered collectible, at which time interest income may be recognized when received. 

The Company maintains its allowance for loan losses at a level believed appropriate by management to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and is based on the size and current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio. Determination of the allowance is inherently subjective as it requires significant estimates, including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on the average historical loss experience, and qualitative considerations. The allowance for loan losses includes the following components: 1) specific reserves on impaired loans, 2) a general reserve based upon historical loss experience and 3) qualitative factors to adjust the historical loss experience used, if deemed necessary.

##TABLE_END

If a loan is impaired, the Company analyzes the loan for purposes of calculating our specific impairment reserves. Loans with a credit risk rating of a 6 through 9 are reviewed to determine if (a) an amount is deemed uncollectible (a charge-off) or (b) it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect amounts due in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan (an impaired loan). If a loan is impaired, the carrying amount of the loan is compared to the expected payments to be received, discounted at the loan&#8217;s original rate, or for collateral dependent loans, to the fair value of the collateral less the estimated cost to sell. Any shortfall is recorded as a specific reserve. For loans that are not considered impaired loans, a general reserve is established based on historical loss experience, adjusted for certain qualitative factors, related to the type of loan collateral, if any, and the assigned credit risk rating. Such qualitative factors assessed by management include the following:

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226;

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the bank&#8217;s existing portfolio. 

##TABLE_END 

All such estimates and considerations may be susceptible to significant change. Loan losses are charged off against the allowance, while recoveries are credited to the allowance. A provision for credit losses is charged to income based on management&#8217;s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned, as well as other pertinent factors. Evaluations are conducted at least quarterly and more frequently if deemed necessary. 

Under accounting guidance applicable to loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination, the excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable yield and is recognized in interest income over the remaining estimated life of the loans, using the effective-interest method. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. Changes in the expected cash flows from the date of acquisition will either impact the accretable yield or result in a charge to the provision for credit losses. Subsequent decreases to expected principal cash flows will result in a charge to provision for credit losses and a corresponding increase to allowance for loan losses. Subsequent increases in expected principal cash flows will result in recovery of any previously recorded allowance for loan losses, to the extent applicable, and a reclassification from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield for any remaining increase. All changes in expected interest cash flows, including the impact of prepayments, will result in reclassifications to/from nonaccretable differences. 

In estimating expected losses, the Company evaluates loans for impairment in accordance ASC 310, &#8220;Receivables.&#8221; A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan. Impaired loans include non-accrual loans, restructured loans or loans with principal and/or interest at risk, even if the loan is current with all payments of principal and interest. Impairment is measured by estimating the fair value of the loan based on the present value of expected cash flows, the market price of the loan, or the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the estimated fair value of the loan is less than the recorded book value, a valuation allowance is established as a component of the allowance for loan losses. For TDRs in which impairment is calculated by the present value of future cash flows, the Company records interest income representing the decrease in impairment resulting from the passage of time during the respective period, which differs from interest income from contractually required interest on these specific loans. 

The Company also maintains an allowance for lending-related commitments, specifically unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit, to provide for the risk of loss inherent in these arrangements. The allowance is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for loan losses. This allowance is included in other liabilities on the statement of condition while the corresponding provision for these losses is recorded as a component of the provision for credit losses.

Mortgage Servicing Rights ("MSRs") 

MSRs are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Condition at fair value in accordance with ASC 860, &#8220;Transfers and Servicing.&#8221; The Company originates mortgage loans for sale to the secondary market. Certain loans are originated and sold with servicing rights retained. MSRs associated with loans originated and sold, where servicing is retained, are capitalized at the time of sale at fair value based on the future net cash flows expected to be realized for performing the servicing activities, and included in other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. The change in the fair value of MSRs is recorded as a component of mortgage banking revenue in non-interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company measures the fair value of MSRs by stratifying the servicing rights into pools based on homogeneous characteristics, such as product type and interest rate. The fair value of each servicing rights pool is calculated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with that pool, given current market conditions. Estimates of fair value include assumptions about prepayment speeds, interest rates and other factors which are subject to change over time. Changes in these underlying assumptions could cause the fair value of MSRs to change significantly in the future. 

Lease Investments 

The Company&#8217;s investments in equipment and other assets held on operating leases are reported as lease investments, net. Rental income on operating leases is recognized as income over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Equipment and other assets held on operating leases is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of the cost of the assets held on operating leases, less any residual value, is computed using the straight-line method over the term of the leases, which is generally seven years or less. 

Premises and Equipment 

Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Useful lives generally range from two to 15 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment, two to seven years for software and computer-related equipment and seven to 39 years for buildings and improvements. Land improvements are amortized over a period of 15 years and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the respective lease including any lease renewals deemed to be reasonably assured. Land and antique furnishings and artwork are not subject to depreciation. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized, and maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Internal costs related to the configuration, testing and installation of new software and the modification of existing software that provides additional functionality are capitalized. 

Long-lived depreciable assets are evaluated periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment exists when the expected undiscounted future cash flows of a long-lived asset are less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset based on a quoted market price, if applicable, or a discounted cash flow analysis. Impairment losses are recognized in other non-interest expense. 

FDIC Loss Share Asset (Liability) 

From 2010 to 2012, the Company acquired the banking operations, including the acquisition of certain assets and the assumption of liabilities, of nine financial institutions in FDIC-assisted transactions. Loans comprised the majority of the assets acquired in nearly all of these FDIC-assisted transactions. Eight FDIC-assisted transactions were subject to loss sharing agreements with the FDIC whereby the FDIC agreed to reimburse the Company for 80 % of losses incurred on the purchased loans, other real estate owned (&#8220;OREO&#8221;), and certain other assets. Additionally, clawback provisions within these loss share agreements with the FDIC required the Company to reimburse the FDIC in the event that actual losses on covered assets were lower than the original loss estimates agreed upon with the FDIC with respect of such assets in the loss share agreements. The Company refers to the loans subject to these loss sharing agreements as &#8220;covered loans&#8221; and uses the term &#8220;covered assets&#8221; to refer to covered loans, covered OREO and certain other covered assets during periods subject to such agreements. As of dates subject to such agreements, the loans covered by the loss share agreements were classified and presented as covered loans and the estimated reimbursable losses were recorded as an FDIC indemnification asset or liability in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. 

The loss share assets and liabilities were measured separately from the loan portfolios because they were not contractually embedded in the loans and were not transferable with the loans should the Company choose to dispose of them. Fair values at the acquisition dates were estimated based on projected cash flows available for loss-share based on the credit adjustments estimated for each loan pool and the loss share percentages. Therefore, the Company only recognized a provision for credit losses and charge-offs on the acquired loans for any further credit deterioration subsequent to the acquisition date. Reductions to expected losses, to the

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

extent such reductions to expected losses were the result of an improvement to the actual or expected cash flows from the covered assets, reduced the FDIC loss share asset or increased any FDIC loss share liability. Additional expected losses, to the extent such expected losses resulted in the recognition of an allowance for loan losses, increased the FDIC loss share asset or reduced any FDIC loss share liability. The allowance for loan losses for loans acquired in FDIC-assisted transactions was determined without giving consideration to the amounts recoverable through loss share agreements (since the loss share agreements are separately accounted for and thus presented &#8220;gross&#8221; on the balance sheet). On the Consolidated Statements of Income, the provision for credit losses was reported net of changes in the amount recoverable under the loss share agreements. 

A summary of activity in the allowance for covered loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 is as follows:

Subsequent to the acquisition date, reimbursements received from the FDIC for actual incurred losses reduced FDIC loss share assets or increased FDIC loss share liabilities. In accordance with certain clawback provisions, the Company was required to reimburse the FDIC when actual losses were less than certain thresholds established for each loss share agreement. The balance of these estimated reimbursements and any related amortization were adjusted periodically for changes in the expected losses on covered assets. On the Consolidated Statements of Condition, estimated reimbursements from clawback provisions were recorded as a reduction to FDIC loss share assets or an increase to FDIC loss share liabilities. In the second quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $ 4.9 million reduction to the estimated loss share liability as a result of an adjustment related to such clawback provisions. Although these assets and liabilities were contractual receivables from and payables to the FDIC, there were no contractual interest rates. Additional expected losses, to the extent such expected losses resulted in the recognition of an allowance for loan losses, increased FDIC loss share assets or reduced FDIC loss share liabilities. The corresponding amortization or accretion was recorded as a component of non-interest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income during periods covered by the loss share agreements. 

The following table summarizes the activity in the Company&#8217;s FDIC loss share liability during the period indicated:

On October 16, 2017, the Company entered into agreements with the FDIC that terminated all existing loss share agreements with the FDIC. Under the terms of the agreements, the Company made a net payment of $ 15.2 million to the FDIC as consideration for the early termination of the loss share agreements. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of approximately $ 0.4 million to write off the remaining loss share asset, relieve the claw-back liability and recognize the payment to the FDIC. The allowance for

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

covered loan losses previously measured is included within the allowance for credit losses, excluding covered loans, for subsequent periods. 

Other Real Estate Owned 

Other real estate owned is comprised of real estate acquired in partial or full satisfaction of loans and is included in other assets. Other real estate owned is recorded at its estimated fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of transfer. Any excess of the related loan balance over the fair value less expected selling costs is charged to the allowance for loan losses. In contrast, any excess of the fair value less expected selling costs over the related loan balance is recorded as a recovery of prior charge-offs on the loan and, if any portion of the excess exceeds prior charge-offs, as an increase to earnings. Subsequent changes in value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount and are recorded in other non-interest expense. Gains and losses upon sale, if any, are also charged to other non-interest expense. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, other real estate owned, excluding covered other real estate owned, totaled $ 15.2 million and $ 24.8 million , respectively. 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. In accordance with accounting standards, goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when events warrant, using a qualitative or quantitative approach. Intangible assets which have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and also are subject to impairment testing. Intangible assets which have indefinite lives are evaluated each reporting date to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If an indefinite useful life can no longer be supported for such asset, the intangible asset will begin amortization over the estimated useful life at that point of time. If an indefinite useful life can be supported, the asset is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when events warrant, using a qualitative or quantitative approach. All of the Company&#8217;s intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over varying periods not exceeding twenty years . 

Bank-Owned Life Insurance ("BOLI") 

The Company maintains BOLI on certain executives. BOLI balances are recorded at their cash surrender values and are included in other assets. Changes in the cash surrender values are included in non-interest income. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , BOLI totaled $ 187.5 million and $ 147.9 million , respectively. 

Derivative Instruments 

The Company enters into derivative transactions principally to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements on the future cash flows or the value of certain assets and liabilities. The Company is also required to recognize certain contracts and commitments, including certain commitments to fund mortgage loans held-for-sale, as derivatives when the characteristics of those contracts and commitments meet the definition of a derivative. The Company accounts for derivatives in accordance with ASC 815, &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging,&#8221; which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded in the statement of condition at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. 

Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or liability attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Formal documentation of the relationship between a derivative instrument and a hedged asset or liability, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction and an assessment of effectiveness is required at inception to apply hedge accounting. In addition, formal documentation of ongoing effectiveness testing is required to maintain hedge accounting. 

Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and the changes in the fair value related to the risk being hedged of the hedged asset or liability on the statement of condition with corresponding offsets recorded in the income statement. The adjustment to the hedged asset or liability is included in the basis of the hedged item, while the fair value of the derivative is recorded as a freestanding asset or liability. Actual cash receipts or payments and related amounts accrued during the period on derivatives included in a fair value hedge relationship are recorded as adjustments to the interest income or expense recorded on the hedged asset or liability. 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument on the statement of condition as either a freestanding asset or liability, with a corresponding offset recorded in other comprehensive income within shareholders&#8217; equity, net of deferred taxes. Amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense in the period or periods the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. 

Under both the fair value and cash flow hedge scenarios, changes in the fair value of derivatives not considered to be highly effective in hedging the change in fair value or the expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized in earnings as non-interest income during the period of the change. 

Derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges according to accounting guidance are reported on the statement of condition at fair value and the changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as non-interest income during the period of the change. 

Commitments to fund mortgage loans (i.e. interest rate locks) to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of these mortgage loans are accounted for as derivatives and are not designated in hedging relationships. Fair values of these mortgage derivatives are estimated based on changes in mortgage rates from the date of the commitments. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives are included in mortgage banking revenue. 

Forward currency contracts used to manage foreign exchange risk associated with certain assets are accounted for as derivatives and are not designated in hedging relationships. Foreign currency derivatives are recorded at fair value based on prevailing currency exchange rates at the measurement date. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives resulting from fluctuations in currency rates are recognized in earnings as non-interest income during the period of change. 

Periodically, the Company sells options to an unrelated bank or dealer for the right to purchase certain securities held within the banks&#8217; investment portfolios (&#8220;covered call options&#8221;). These option transactions are designed primarily as an economic hedge to compensate for net interest margin compression by increasing the total return associated with holding the related securities as earning assets by using fee income generated from these options. These transactions are not designated in hedging relationships pursuant to accounting guidance and, accordingly, changes in fair values of these contracts, are reported in other non-interest income. 

Periodically, the Company will purchase options for the right to purchase securities not currently held within the banks' investment portfolios or enter into interest rate swaps in which the Company elects to not designate such derivatives as hedging instruments. These option and swap transactions are designed primarily to economically hedge a portion of the fair value adjustments related to the Company's mortgage servicing rights portfolio. The gain or loss associated with these derivative contracts are included in mortgage banking revenue. 

Trust Assets, Assets Under Management and Brokerage Assets 

Assets held in fiduciary or agency capacity for customers are not included in the consolidated financial statements as they are not assets of Wintrust or its subsidiaries. Fee income is recognized on an accrual basis and is included as a component of non-interest income. 

Income Taxes 

Wintrust and its subsidiaries file a consolidated Federal income tax return. Income tax expense is based upon income in the consolidated financial statements rather than amounts reported on the income tax return. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using currently enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as an income tax benefit or income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. 

Positions taken in the Company&#8217;s tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, uncertain tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the positions will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions are both initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 % likely being realized upon settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Interest and penalties on income tax uncertainties are classified within income tax expense in the income statement.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans 

In accordance with ASC 718, &#8220;Compensation &#8212; Stock Compensation,&#8221; compensation cost is measured as the fair value of the awards on their date of grant. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options and the market price of the Company&#8217;s stock at the date of grant is used to estimate the fair value of restricted stock awards. Compensation cost is recognized over the required service period, generally defined as the vesting period. For awards with graded vesting, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. 

Accounting guidance permits for the recognition of stock based compensation for the number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest. As a result, recognized compensation expense for stock options and restricted share awards is reduced for estimated forfeitures prior to vesting. Forfeitures rates are estimated for each type of award based on historical forfeiture experience. Estimated forfeitures will be reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstances. 

The Company issues new shares to satisfy option exercises and vesting of restricted shares. 

Comprehensive Income 

Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, net of deferred taxes, changes in deferred gains and losses on investment securities transferred from available-for-sale debt securities to held-to-maturity debt securities, net of deferred taxes, adjustments related to cash flow hedges, net of deferred taxes and foreign currency translation adjustments, net of deferred taxes. The Company has a policy for releasing the income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income using an individual security approach. 

Stock Repurchases 

The Company periodically repurchases shares of its outstanding common stock through open market purchases or other methods. Repurchased shares are recorded as treasury shares on the trade date using the treasury stock method, and the cash paid is recorded as treasury stock. 

Foreign Currency Translation 

The Company revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each month using applicable exchange rates. 

&#160; 

Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in other comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to the re-measurement of transactions to the functional currency are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Going Concern 

In connection with preparing financial statements for each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, exist that would raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. If substantial doubt exists, specific disclosures are required to be included in the Company's financial statements issued. Through its evaluation, the Company did not identify any conditions or events that would raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. 

New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted 

Amortization of Premium on Certain Debt Securities 

In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-08, &#8220;Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities,&#8221; to amend the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. The amortization period for such securities was shortened to the earliest call date. The Company adopted ASU No. 2017-08 as of January 1, 2019 under a modified retrospective approach. As a result, the Company recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of $ 1.5 million representing the accelerated amortization of premiums on certain callable debt securities directly to retained earnings on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Condition.

Leases 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, &#8220;Leases (Topic 842),&#8221; to improve transparency and comparability across entities regarding leasing arrangements. This ASU requires the recognition of a separate lease liability representing the required discounted lease payments over the lease term and a separate lease asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the same lease term. Further, this ASU provides clarification regarding the identification of certain components of contracts that would represent a lease as well as requires additional disclosures to the notes of the financial statements. Additionally, in January 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-01, "Leases (Topic 842): Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842," to permit an entity to elect an optional practical expedient to not evaluate under Topic 842 land easements that exist or expired before the entity's adoption of Topic 842 and that were not previously accounted for as leases under existing accounting guidance. 

The FASB has continued to issue various updates to clarify and improve specific areas of ASU No. 2016-02. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, &#8220;Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases,&#8221; to clarify the implementation guidance within ASU No. 2016-02 surrounding narrow aspects of Topic 842, including lessee reassessment of lease classifications, the rate implicit in a lease, lessor reassessment of lease terms and purchase options and variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate. Also, in July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, &#8220;Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements,&#8221; to clarify the implementation guidance within ASU No. 2016-02 surrounding comparative period reporting requirements for initial adoption as well as separating lease and non-lease components in a contract and allocating consideration in the contract to the separate components. Also, in December 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-20, &#8220;Leases (Topic 842): Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors,&#8221; to clarify the implementation guidance within ASU No. 2016-02 surrounding specific aspects of lessor accounting. In March 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-01, &#8220;Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases,&#8221; to clarify the implementation guidance within ASU No. 2016-02 surrounding aspects of Topic 842, including determining the fair value of the underlying asset by lessors that are not manufacturers or dealers, presentation on the statement of cash flows, and transition disclosures related to Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. 

The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02 and all subsequent updates issued to clarify and improve specific areas of this ASU as of January 1, 2019. The Company elected an optional transition method to apply the new guidance at the date of adoption (i.e. January 1, 2019) and continue applying current lease accounting guidance for comparative periods (i.e. reporting periods in 2018). As a result, as of January 1, 2019, the Company recognized a separate lease liability and right-of-use asset of approximately $ 199.4 million and $ 170.6 million , respectively, for leasing arrangements in which the Company is a lessee. The difference in the separate lease liability and right-of-use asset represents any remaining amounts related to prepayments, payment deferrals and lease incentives as of January 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the separate lease liability and right-of-use asset was $ 197.6 million and $ 165.7 million , respectively. The separate liability and asset are included within accrued interest payable and other liabilities and accrued interest receivable and other assets, respectively, within the Company's Consolidated Statements of Condition. The leasing arrangements requiring recognition on the Consolidated Statements of Condition primarily related to certain banking facilities under operating lease agreements as well as other leasing arrangements in which the Company has the right-of-use of specific signage related to sponsorships and other agreements and certain automatic teller machines and other equipment. The Company utilized the following other transition elections and practical expedients: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

For lessee arrangements of certain classes of underlying assets, including banking facilities and equipment, the Company elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components and instead to account for each separate lease and non-lease component as a single lease component. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

For lessor arrangements that meet certain criteria (leasing of space in owned facilities), the Company elected the practical expedient to account for each separate lease and non-lease component as a single lease component. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

A package of practical expedients applied to leases existing prior to the effective date that must all be elected together and allow a Company to not reassess:

whether any expiring or existing contracts are or contain a lease; 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9702; 

lease classification for any expired or existing leases; and 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9702; 

whether initial direct costs for any expired or existing leases qualify for capitalization. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

A practical expedient that permits the Company to continue applying its current policy for accounting for expired or existing land easements. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

An accounting policy election for short-term leases (i.e. terms of 12 months or less with no purchase option expected to be exercised) to apply accounting similar to ASC 840, specifically to not recognize separate lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. 

##TABLE_END 

As noted above, in accordance with ASU No. 2016-02 and all subsequent updates, the Company recognized a separate lease liability and right-of-use asset related to leasing arrangements in which the Company is the lessee of the identified asset. These lease arrangements include primarily the use of certain buildings, retail space and office space for the Company's operations and are considered operating leases. The underlying agreements of these arrangements often require fixed payments on a monthly 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

basis. These fixed payments are included as consideration when measuring the separate lease liability and right-of-use asset noted above. Other payments are made on a monthly basis for certain items that are considered variable, including payments for insurance, real estate taxes and maintenance. Additionally, underlying agreements often have an initial period of use followed by certain extension periods. The Company considers such extensions for purposes of lease classification and the measurement of the separate lease liability and right-of-use asset. If the Company is reasonably certain to elect to extend the leasing arrangement, the lease term would include these periods for the purposes noted above. As a lessee, the Company cannot readily determine the rate implicit in the lease. As a result, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate when measuring the separate lease liability and right-of-use asset. The Company estimated the incremental borrowing rate as the rate of interest that would be paid to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term in a similar economic environment. 

(2) Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, &#8220;Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,&#8221; to replace the current incurred loss methodology for recognizing credit losses, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred, with a methodology that reflects an estimate of all expected credit losses and considers additional reasonable and supportable forecasted information when determining lifetime credit loss estimates. This impacts the calculation of an allowance for credit losses for all financial assets measured under the amortized cost basis, including held-to-maturity debt securities and purchased credit deteriorated ("PCD") assets at the time of and subsequent to acquisition. Additionally, credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities would be recorded through the allowance for credit losses and not as a direct adjustment to the amortized cost of the securities. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied under a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the Company's Consolidated Statements of Condition as of the first reporting period of adoption. 

The FASB has continued to issue various updates to clarify and improve specific areas of ASU No. 2016-13. In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-19, &#8220;Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses,&#8221; to clarify the implementation guidance within ASU No. 2016-13 surrounding narrow aspects of Topic 326, including the impact of the guidance on operating lease receivables. In May 2019, FASB issued ASU No. 2019-05, &#8220;Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Targeted Transition Relief," allowing for the irrevocable election of the fair value option for certain financial assets, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, within the scope previously measured at amortized cost basis. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-11, &#8220;Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses,&#8221; to clarify and improve implementation guidance on certain aspects of Topic 326, including expected recoveries on purchased financial assets with credit deterioration, financial assets secured by collateral maintenance provisions, adjustment of the effective interest rate for troubled debt restructurings for prepayment assumptions existing at the time of adoption of Topic 326, and disclosure relief for accrued interest receivable balances. Like ASU No. 2016-13, these ASUs are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied under a modified retrospective approach. 

The Company has continued its efforts in implementation of ASU No. 2016-13 and all subsequent updates issued to clarify and improve specific areas of this ASU. As discussed previously, throughout the implementation process, the Company has utilized a committee consisting of individuals from various areas of the Company tasked with transitioning to the new requirements. Implementation activities in prior periods included a review of historical internal data, the development and initial validation of modeling methodologies, including the determination of appropriate segmentation and assumptions, and the consideration of certain accounting policy elections. At this time, the Company is finalizing its model methodologies and processes, and continues to review recent model results for its loan portfolios and held-to-maturity debt investment securities. Controls and processes have been designed and implemented for the continued implementation process and are being designed for the ongoing process following adoption . 

The Company's model methodologies consider characteristics of the specific portfolio or asset segment, risk rating distributions and historical probability of default and loss given default, adjusted for current conditions and a single future economic forecast determined by the Company. Other assumptions in the Company's measurement methodology include the following: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Future economic forecasts will be over an eight-quarter reasonable and supportable forecast period. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

In the event that the life of the asset exceeds the reasonable and supportable forecast period, measurement of expected credit losses will revert to historical loss information over four quarters. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Future prepayments are considered when determining expected credit losses over the life of an asset.

Further, as noted above, certain accounting policy elections are available under the new rules. The Company will utilize the following approach to such elections: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The Company will not measure an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest if such accrued interest is written off in a timely manner when deemed uncollectible. Any such write-off of accrued interest will reverse previously recognized interest income. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The Company will not include accrued interest within presentation and disclosures of the carrying amount of financial assets held at amortized cost. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The Company will estimate expected credit losses by measuring the face amount or unpaid principal balance component of the amortized cost basis of a financial asset separately from other components such as premiums, discount and deferred fees and costs. 

##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#8226; 

The Company will not maintain current accounting policies for existing purchase credit impaired ("PCI") financial assets. At the effective date, such assets will be considered PCD assets and measured accordingly under the new rules.

Goodwill 

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, &#8220;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,&#8221; to simplify the subsequent measurement of goodwill. When the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an entity would no longer be required to determine goodwill impairment by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if that reporting unit was acquired in a business combination. Goodwill impairment would be recognized according to the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit over the calculated fair value of such unit. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied under a prospective approach. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

Fair Value Measurement 

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, &#8220;Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirement for Fair Value Measurement,&#8221; to modify disclosure requirements on fair value measurements and inputs. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied prospectively or retrospectively depending upon the disclosure requirement. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

Intangibles 

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, &#8220;Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract,&#8221; to align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with similar requirements related to implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. In addition, the amendment requires any capitalized implementation costs related to a hosting arrangement to be expensed over the term of the hosting arrangement. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 

Codification Improvements 

In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04, &#8220;Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments." The FASB has continued to issue various updates to clarify and improve specific areas of ASU No. 2016-01, ASU No. 2016-13, and ASU No. 2017-12. Amendments related to ASU No. 2016-01 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and can be early adopted, under a modified retrospective approach, since the Company has already adopted ASU No. 2016-01. Since the Company has not yet adopted ASU No. 2016-13, the effective dates and transition requirements for the amendments related to ASU No. 2019-04 are the same as the effective dates and transition requirements in ASU No. 2016-13 described above. Amendments related to ASU No. 2017-12 are effective as of the beginning of the first annual period beginning after the issuance date of ASU No. 2019-04 and can be early adopted since the Company has already adopted ASU No. 2017-12. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Income Taxes 

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes," to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles of ASC 740, "Income Taxes". The guidance also improves consistent application by clarifying and amending existing guidance from ASC 740. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods therein and is to be applied on a retrospective, modified retrospective or prospective approach, depending on the specific amendment. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements.

##TABLE_END

The Company conducts a regular assessment of its investment securities to determine whether securities are other-than-temporarily impaired considering, among other factors, the nature of the securities, credit ratings or financial condition of the issuer, the extent and duration of the unrealized loss, expected cash flows, market conditions and the Company&#8217;s ability to hold the securities through the anticipated recovery period. 

The Company does not consider securities with unrealized losses at December 31, 2019 to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company does not intend to sell these investments and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these investments before recovery of the amortized cost bases, which may be the maturity dates of the securities. The unrealized

During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $ 262,000 of impairment of equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The Company conducts a quarterly assessment of its equity securities without readily determinable fair values to determine whether impairment exists in such equity securities, considering, among other factors, the nature of the securities, financial condition of the issuer and expected future cash flows. 

Net losses/gains on investment securities resulted in income tax expense (benefit) of $ 913,000 , ($ 737,000 ) and $ 18,000 in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively.

the United States and Canada. The Company strives to maintain a loan portfolio that is diverse in terms of loan type, industry, borrower and geographic concentrations. Such diversification reduces the exposure to economic downturns that may occur in different segments of the economy or in different industries. 

Certain premium finance receivables are recorded net of unearned income. The unearned income portions of such premium finance receivables were $ 118.4 million and $ 112.9 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. 

Total loans, excluding PCI loans, include net deferred loan fees and costs and fair value purchase accounting adjustments totaling $ 9.1 million and $ 4.5 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. PCI loans are recorded net of credit discounts. See &#8220;Acquired Loan Information at Acquisition - PCI Loans&#8221; below. 

Certain real estate loans, including mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial, consumer, and home equity loans with balances totaling approximately $ 6.8 billion and $ 6.1 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were pledged as collateral to secure the availability of borrowings from certain federal agency banks. At December 31, 2019, approximately $ 6.4 billion of these pledged loans are included in a blanket pledge of qualifying loans to the FHLB. The remaining $ 359.3 million of pledged loans was used to secure potential borrowings at the FRB discount window. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the banks had outstanding borrowings of $ 674.9 million and $ 426.3 million , respectively, from the FHLB in connection with these collateral arrangements. See Note 11, &#8220;Federal Home Loan Bank Advances,&#8221; for a summary of these borrowings. 

It is the policy of the Company to review each prospective credit in order to determine the appropriateness and, when required, the adequacy of security or collateral necessary to obtain when making a loan. The type of collateral, when required, will vary from liquid assets to real estate. The Company seeks to assure access to collateral, in the event of default, through adherence to state lending laws and the Company&#8217;s credit monitoring procedures. 

Acquired Loan Information at Acquisition &#8212; PCI Loans 

As part of the Company's previous acquisitions, the Company acquired loans for which there was evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination (PCI loans) and we determined that it was probable that the Company would be unable to collect all contractually required principal and interest payments. The following table presents the unpaid principal balance and carrying value for these acquired loans as of the dates shown:

Accretable Yield Activity &#8212; PCI Loans 

Changes in expected cash flows may vary from period to period as the Company periodically updates its cash flow model assumptions for PCI loans. The factors that most significantly affect the estimates of gross cash flows expected to be collected, and accordingly the accretable yield, include changes in the benchmark interest rate indices for variable-rate products and changes in prepayment assumptions and loss estimates. The following table provides activity for the accretable yield of PCI loans.

PCI loans represent loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination, in accordance with ASC 310-30. Loan agings are based upon contractually required payments. See Note 4 , &#8220;Loans,&#8221; for further discussion of these purchased loans. 

##TABLE_END 

The Company's ability to manage credit risk depends in large part on our ability to properly identify and manage problem loans. To do so, the Company operates a credit risk rating system under which credit management personnel assign a credit risk rating (1 to 10 rating) to each loan at the time of origination and review loans on a regular basis. 

Each loan officer is responsible for monitoring his or her loan portfolio, recommending a credit risk rating for each loan in his or her portfolio and ensuring the credit risk ratings are appropriate. These credit risk ratings are then ratified by the bank&#8217;s chief credit officer and/or concurrence credit officer. Credit risk ratings are determined by evaluating a number of factors including: a borrower&#8217;s financial strength, cash flow coverage, collateral protection and guarantees. 

The Company&#8217;s Problem Loan Reporting system includes all loans with credit risk ratings of 6 through 9. This system is designed to provide an on-going detailed tracking mechanism for each problem loan. Once management determines that a loan has deteriorated to a point where it has a credit risk rating of 6 or worse, the Company&#8217;s Managed Asset Division performs an overall credit and collateral review. As part of this review, all underlying collateral is identified and the valuation methodology is analyzed and tracked. As a result of this initial review by the Company&#8217;s Managed Asset Division, the credit risk rating is reviewed and a portion of the outstanding loan balance may be deemed uncollectible or an impairment reserve may be established. The Company&#8217;s impairment analysis utilizes an independent re-appraisal of the collateral (unless such a third-party evaluation is not possible due to the unique nature of the collateral, such as a closely-held business or thinly traded securities). In the case of commercial real estate collateral, an independent third party appraisal is ordered by the Company&#8217;s Real Estate Services Group to determine if 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

there has been any change in the underlying collateral value. These independent appraisals are reviewed by the Real Estate Services Group and sometimes by independent third party valuation experts and may be adjusted depending upon market conditions. 

Through the credit risk rating process, loans are reviewed to determine if they are performing in accordance with the original contractual terms. If the borrower has failed to comply with the original contractual terms, further action may be required by the Company, including a downgrade in the credit risk rating, movement to non-accrual status, a charge-off or the establishment of a specific impairment reserve. If the Company determines that a loan amount or portion thereof is uncollectible the loan&#8217;s credit risk rating is immediately downgraded to an 8 or 9 and the uncollectible amount is charged-off. Any loan that has a partial charge-off continues to be assigned a credit risk rating of an 8 or 9 for the duration of time that a balance remains outstanding. The Company undertakes a thorough and ongoing analysis to determine if additional impairment and/or charge-offs are appropriate and to begin a workout plan for the credit to minimize actual losses. 

If, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due to it according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, a specific impairment reserve is established. In determining the appropriate charge-off for collateral-dependent loans, the Company considers the results of appraisals for the associated collateral. 

Non-performing loans include all non-accrual loans (8 and 9 risk ratings) as well as loans 90 days past due and still accruing interest, excluding PCI loans. The remainder of the portfolio is considered performing under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The following table presents the recorded investment based on performance of loans by class, per the most recent analysis at December 31, 2019 and 2018 :

##TABLE_END

Average recorded investment in impaired loans for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 were $ 151.8 million , $ 133.5 million , and $ 115.3 million , respectively. Interest income recognized on impaired loans was $ 9.4 million , $ 7.3 million and $ 6.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. 

TDRs 

At December 31, 2019 , the Company had $ 63.8 million in loans modified in TDRs. The $ 63.8 million in TDRs represents 255 credits in which economic concessions were granted to certain borrowers to better align the terms of their loans with their current ability to pay. 

The Company&#8217;s approach to restructuring loans, excluding PCI loans, is built on its credit risk rating system which requires credit management personnel to assign a credit risk rating to each loan. In each case, the loan officer is responsible for recommending a credit risk rating for each loan and ensuring the credit risk ratings are appropriate. These credit risk ratings are then reviewed and approved by the bank&#8217;s chief credit officer and/or concurrence credit officer. Credit risk ratings are determined by evaluating a number of factors including a borrower&#8217;s financial strength, cash flow coverage, collateral protection and guarantees. The Company&#8217;s credit risk rating scale is one through ten with higher scores indicating higher risk. In the case of loans rated six or worse following modification, the Company&#8217;s Managed Assets Division evaluates the loan and the credit risk rating and determines that the loan has been restructured to be reasonably assured of repayment and of performance according to the modified terms and is supported by a current, well-documented credit assessment of the borrower&#8217;s financial condition and prospects for repayment under the revised terms.

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

A modification of a loan, excluding PCI loans, with an existing credit risk rating of 6 or worse or a modification of any other credit, which will result in a restructured credit risk rating of 6 or worse, must be reviewed for possible TDR classification. In that event, our Managed Assets Division conducts an overall credit and collateral review. A modification of these loans is considered to be a TDR if both (1) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and (2) for economic or legal reasons, the bank grants a concession to a borrower that it would not otherwise consider. The modification of a loan, excluding PCI loans, where the credit risk rating is 5 or better both before and after such modification is not considered to be a TDR. Based on the Company&#8217;s credit risk rating system, it considers that borrowers whose credit risk rating is 5 or better are not experiencing financial difficulties and therefore, are not considered TDRs. 

All credits determined to be a TDR will continue to be classified as a TDR in all subsequent periods, unless the borrower has been in compliance with the loan&#8217;s modified terms for a period of six months (including over a calendar year-end) and the current interest rate represents a market rate at the time of restructuring. The Managed Assets Division, in consultation with the respective loan officer, determines whether the modified interest rate represented a current market rate at the time of restructuring. Using knowledge of current market conditions and rates, competitive pricing on recent loan originations, and an assessment of various characteristics of the modified loan (including collateral position and payment history), an appropriate market rate for a new borrower with similar risk is determined. If the modified interest rate meets or exceeds this market rate for a new borrower with similar risk, the modified interest rate represents a market rate at the time of restructuring. Additionally, before removing a loan from TDR classification, a review of the current or previously measured impairment on the loan and any concerns related to future performance by the borrower is conducted. If concerns exist about the future ability of the borrower to meet its obligations under the loans based on a credit review by the Managed Assets Division, the TDR classification is not removed from the loan. 

TDRs are reviewed at the time of modification and on a quarterly basis to determine if a specific reserve is necessary. The carrying amount of the loan is compared to the expected payments to be received, discounted at the loan&#8217;s original rate, or for collateral dependent loans, to the fair value of the collateral. Any shortfall is recorded as a specific reserve. The Company, in accordance with ASC 310-10, continues to individually measure impairment of these loans after the TDR classification is removed. 

Each TDR was reviewed for impairment at December 31, 2019 and approximately $ 5.7 million of impairment was present and appropriately reserved for through the Company&#8217;s normal reserving methodology in the Company&#8217;s allowance for loan losses. For TDRs in which impairment is calculated by the present value of future cash flows, the Company records interest income representing the decrease in impairment resulting from the passage of time during the respective period, which differs from interest income from contractually required interest on these specific loans. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company recorded $ 66,000 and $ 113,000 , respectively, in interest income representing this decrease in impairment. 

TDRs may arise in which, due to financial difficulties experienced by the borrower, the Company obtains through physical possession one or more collateral assets in satisfaction of all or part of an existing credit. Once possession is obtained, the Company reclassifies the appropriate portion of the remaining balance of the credit from loans to OREO, which is included within other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. For any residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, the Company is considered to possess the related collateral only if legal title is obtained upon completion of foreclosure, or the borrower conveys all interest in the residential real estate property to the Company through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or similar legal agreement. At December 31, 2019 , the Company had $ 1.8 million of foreclosed residential real estate properties included within OREO. Further, the recorded investment in residential mortgage loans secured by residential real estate properties for which foreclosure proceedings are in process totaled $ 13.5 million and $ 14.4 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

##TABLE_END

The Company recognizes MSR assets upon the sale of residential real estate loans to external third parties when it retains the obligation to service the loans and the servicing fee is more than adequate compensation. The initial recognition of MSR assets from loans sold with servicing retained and subsequent changes in fair value of all MSRs are recognized in mortgage banking revenue. MSRs are subject to changes in value from actual and expected prepayment of the underlying loans. The Company did not specifically hedge the value of its MSRs in 2018 or 2017. Starting in 2019, the Company periodically purchased options for the right to purchase securities not currently held within the banks' investment portfolio and entered into interest rate swaps in which the Company elected to not designate such derivatives as hedging instruments. These option and swap transactions are designed primarily to economically hedge a portion of the fair value adjustments related to MSRs. For more information regarding such economic hedges in 2019, see Note 21, "Derivative Financial Instruments" in Item 8 of this report. 

Fair values are determined by using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the objective characteristics of the portfolio as well as subjective valuation parameters that purchasers of servicing would apply to such portfolios sold into the secondary market. The subjective factors include loan prepayment speeds, discount rates, servicing costs and other economic factors. The Company uses a third party to assist in the valuation of MSRs.

On August 1, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of CSC. CSC was the parent company of Delaware Place Bank. Through this business combination, the Company acquired Delaware Place Bank's one banking location in Chicago, Illinois. As of the acquisition date, the Company acquired approximately $ 282.8 million in assets, including approximately $ 152.7 million in loans, and approximately $ 213.1 million in deposits. Additionally, the Company recorded goodwill of approximately $ 26.6 million related to the acquisition. 

Wealth Management Acquisitions 

On December 14, 2018, the Company acquired Elektra, the parent company of CDEC. CDEC is a provider of Qualified Intermediary services (as defined by U.S. Treasury regulations) for taxpayers seeking to structure tax-deferred like-kind exchanges under Internal Revenue Code Section 1031. CDEC has successfully facilitated more than 8,000 like-kind exchanges in the past decade for taxpayers nationwide. These transactions typically generate customer deposits during the period following the sale of the property until such proceeds are used to purchase a replacement property. The Company recorded goodwill of approximately $ 37.3 million related to the acquisition. 

Mortgage Banking Acquisitions 

On January 4, 2018, the Company acquired Veterans First with assets including mortgage-servicing-rights on approximately 10,000 loans, totaling an estimated $ 1.6 billion in unpaid principal balance. The Company recorded goodwill of approximately $ 9.1 million related to the acquisition. 

On February 14, 2017, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of the mortgage banking business of AHM. The Company recorded goodwill of approximately $ 1.0 million related to the acquisition. 

PCI loans 

Purchased loans acquired in a business combination are recorded at estimated fair value on their purchase date. For PCI loans, expected future cash flows at the purchase date in excess of the fair value of loans are recorded as interest income over the life of the loans if the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable (&#8220;accretable yield&#8221;). The difference between contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the non-accretable difference and represents probable losses in the portfolio. 

In determining the acquisition date fair value of PCI loans, and in subsequent accounting, the Company aggregates these purchased loans into pools of loans by common risk characteristics, such as credit risk rating and loan type. Subsequent to the purchase date, increases in cash flows over those expected at the purchase date are recognized as interest income prospectively. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will result in a provision for loan losses. 

The Company purchased a portfolio of life insurance premium finance receivables in 2009. These purchased life insurance premium finance receivables are valued on an individual basis. If credit related conditions deteriorate, an allowance related to these loans will be established as part of the provision for credit losses. 

See Note 4, &#8220;Loans,&#8221; for more information on loans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination.

The Company assesses each reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis and considers potential indicators of impairment at each reporting date between annual goodwill impairment tests. Annual goodwill impairment tests were historically performed as of June 30 for the Company&#8217;s community banking reporting unit and as of December 31 for the Company&#8217;s specialty finance and wealth management reporting units. At June 30, 2019, the Company utilized a qualitative approach for its annual goodwill impairment test of the community banking reporting unit and determined that it was not more likely than not that an impairment existed at that time. 

During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company voluntarily changed the dates of its annual goodwill impairment tests to October 1 for all reporting units on a prospective basis. The change was made to more closely align the impairment testing dates with the timing of the Company&#8217;s long-term planning and forecasting process. 

At October 1, 2019, the Company utilized a quantitative approach for its annual goodwill impairment tests of the specialty finance and wealth management reporting units and determined that no impairment existed at that time. To ensure no more than 12 months elapsed between impairment tests, the Company utilized a qualitative approach as of October 1, 2019 for its goodwill impairment test of the community banking reporting unit and determined that it was not more likely than not that an impairment existed at that time. As of December 31, 2019, the Company identified no indicators of goodwill impairment within the community banking, specialty finance or wealth management reporting units.

Borrowings under the agreement that are considered &#8220;Eurodollar Rate Loans&#8221; bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of (1) 125 basis points (in the case of a borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility) or 125 basis points (in the case of a borrowing under the Term Facility) plus (2) the LIBOR rate for the applicable period, as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities (the &#8220;Eurodollar Rate&#8221;). A commitment fee is payable quarterly equal to 0.20 % of the actual daily amount by which the lenders' commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility exceeded the amount outstanding under such facility. 

Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by pledges of and first priority perfected security interests in the Company's equity interest in its bank subsidiaries and contain several restrictive covenants, including the maintenance of various capital adequacy levels, asset quality and profitability ratios, and certain restrictions on dividends and other indebtedness.

Wealth Management Revenue 

Wealth management revenue is comprised of brokerage and insurance product commissions, managed money fees and trust and asset management revenue of the Company's four wealth management subsidiaries: Wintrust Investments, Great Lakes Advisors, CTC and CDEC. All wealth management revenue is recognized in the wealth management segment. 

Brokerage and insurance product commissions consists primarily of commissions earned from trade execution services on behalf of customers and from selling mutual funds, insurance and other investment products to customers. For trade execution services, the Company recognizes commissions and receives payment from the brokerage customers at the point of transaction execution. Commissions received from the investment or insurance product providers are recognized at the point of sale of the product. The Company also receives trail and other commissions from providers for certain plans. These are generally based on qualifying account values and are recognized once the performance obligation, specific to each provider, is satisfied on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. 

Trust revenue is earned primarily from trust and custody services that are generally performed over time as well as fees earned on funds held during the facilitation of tax-deferred like-kind exchange transactions. Revenue is determined periodically based on a schedule of fees applied to the value of each customer account using a time-elapsed method to measure progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. Fees are typically billed on a calendar month or quarter basis in advance or in arrears depending upon the contract. Upfront fees received related to the facilitation of tax-deferred like-kind exchange 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

transactions are deferred until the transaction is completed. Additional fees earned for certain extraordinary services performed on behalf of the customers are recognized when the service has been performed. 

&#160; 

Asset management revenue is earned from money management and advisory services that are performed over time. Revenue is based primarily on the market value of assets under management or administration using a time-elapsed method to measure progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. Fees are typically billed on a calendar month or quarter basis in advance or in arrears depending upon the contract. Certain programs provide the customer with an option of paying fees as a percentage of the account value or incurring commission charges for each trade similar to brokerage and insurance product commissions. Trade commissions and any other fees received for additional services are recognized at a point in time once the performance obligation is satisfied. 

Mortgage Broker Fees 

For customers desiring a mortgage product not currently offered by the Company, the Company may refer such customers and, with permission, direct such customers' applications to certain third party mortgage brokers. Mortgage broker fees are received from these brokers for such customer referrals upon settlement of the underlying mortgage. The Company's entitlement to the consideration is contingent on the settlement of the mortgage which is highly susceptible to factors outside of the Company's influence, such as the third party broker's underwriting requirements. Also, the uncertainty surrounding the consideration could be resolved in varying lengths of time, dependent upon the third party brokers. Therefore, mortgage broker fees are recognized at the settlement of the underlying mortgage when the consideration is received. Broker fees are recognized in the community banking segment. 

Service Charges on Deposit Accounts 

Service charges on deposit accounts include fees charged to deposit customers for various services, including account analysis services, and are based on factors such as the size and type of customer, type of product and number of transactions. The fees are based on a standard schedule of fees and, depending on the nature of the service performed, the service is performed at a point in time or over a period of a month. When the service is performed at a point in time, the Company recognizes and receives revenue when the service has been performed. When the service is performed over a period of a month, the Company recognizes and receives revenue in the month the service has been performed. Service charges on deposit accounts are recognized in the community banking segment. 

Administrative Services 

Administrative services revenue is earned from providing outsourced administrative services, such as data processing of payrolls, billing and cash management services, to temporary staffing service clients located throughout the United States. Fees are charged periodically (typically a payroll cycle) and computed in accordance with the contractually determined rate applied to the total gross billings administered for the period. The revenue is recognized over the period using a time-elapsed method to measure progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. Other fees are charged on a per occurrence basis as the service is provided in the billing cycle. The Company has certain contracts with customers to perform outsourced administrative services and short-term accounts receivable financing. For these contracts, the total fee is allocated between the administrative services revenue and interest income during the client onboarding process based on the specific client and services provided. Administrative services revenue is recognized in the specialty finance segment. 

Card and Deposit Related Fees 

Card related fees include interchange and merchant revenue, and fees related to debit and credit cards. Interchange revenue is related to the Company issued debit cards. Other deposit related fees primarily include pay by phone processing fees, ATM and safe deposit box fees, check order charges and foreign currency related fees. Card and deposit related fees are generally based on volume of transactions and are recognized at the point in time when the service has been performed. For any consideration that is constrained, the revenue is recognized once the uncertainty is known. Upfront fees received from certain contracts are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. Card and deposit related fees are recognized in the community banking segment.

Contract liabilities represent upfront fees that the Company received at inception of certain contracts. The revenue recognized that was included in the contract liability balance at beginning of the period totaled $ 759,000 and $ 369,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Receivables are recognized in the period the Company provides services when the Company's right to consideration is unconditional. Card related fee receivable is the result of volume based fee that the Company receives from a customer on an annual basis in the second quarter of each year. Payment terms on other invoiced amounts are typically 30 days or less. Contract liabilities and receivables from contracts with customers are included within the accrued interest payable and other liabilities and accrued interest receivable and other assets line items, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Condition.

Practical Expedients and Exemptions 

The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the Company transfers a promised service to a customer and when the customer pays for that services is one year or less. 

The Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognized is one year or less.

(16) Lease Commitments 

In accordance with ASU No. 2016-02 and all subsequent updates issued to clarify and improve specific areas of this ASU, as of January 1, 2019 , the Company recognized a separate lease liability and right-of-use asset of approximately $ 199.4 million and $ 170.6 million , respectively, for leasing arrangements in which the Company is a lessee. The difference in the separate lease liability and right-of-use asset represents any remaining amounts related to prepayments, payment deferrals and lease incentives as of January 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the separate lease liability and right-of-use asset was $ 197.6 million and $ 165.7 million , respectively. The separate liability and asset are included within accrued interest payable and other liabilities and accrued interest receivable and other assets, respectively, within the Company's Consolidated Statements of Condition. The leasing arrangements requiring recognition on the Consolidated Statements of Condition primarily related to certain banking facilities under operating lease agreements as well as other leasing arrangements in which the Company has the right-of-use of specific signage related to sponsorships and other agreements and certain automatic teller machines and other equipment. See Note 1,&#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,&#8221; for further discussion of the Company's adoption of ASU No. 2016-02.

Management has determined that a valuation allowance is not required for the deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019 because it is more likely than not that these assets could be realized through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and future taxable income. This conclusion is based on the Company's historical earnings, its current level of earnings and prospects for continued growth and profitability. 

The Company has a Federal alternative minimum tax (&#8220;AMT&#8221;) credit carryforward of $ 1.3 million which is subject to IRC Section 383 annual limitation. The AMT credit has no expiration date and pursuant to the Tax Act will be fully refundable by 2021 . The Company has a Federal net operating loss (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) carryforward of $ 19.1 million that begins to expire in 2029 through 2037 and is subject to IRC Section 382 annual limitation. The AMT credit and the NOL carryforwards were a result of acquisitions. 

The Company accounts for uncertainties in income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits:

At December 31, 2019 , the Company had $ 8.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. Interest and penalties on unrecognized tax positions are recorded in income tax expense. Total interest income accrued at December 31, 2019 and 2018 on unrecognized tax benefits was $ 1.7 million and $ 1.1 million , respectively, net of tax effect. Interest and penalties are included in the liability for uncertain tax positions, but are not included in the unrecognized tax benefits rollforward presented above. The Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase or decrease in the next twelve months. 

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in numerous state jurisdictions and in Canada. In the ordinary course of business we are routinely subject to audit by the taxing authorities of these jurisdictions. Currently, the Company's U.S. federal income tax returns are open and subject to audit for the 2016 tax return year forward, and in general, the Company's state income tax returns are open and subject to audit from the 2016 tax return year forward, subject to individual state statutes of limitation. The Company's Canadian subsidiary's Canadian income tax returns are also subject to audit for the 2016 tax return year forward. 

(18) Stock Compensation Plans and Other Employee Benefit Plans 

Stock Incentive Plan 

In May 2015, the Company&#8217;s shareholders approved the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (&#8220;the 2015 Plan&#8221;) which provides for the issuance of up to 5,485,000 shares of common stock. The 2015 Plan replaced the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (&#8220;the 2007 Plan&#8221;), which replaced the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan (&#8220;the 1997 Plan&#8221;). The 2015 Plan, the 2007 Plan and the 1997 Plan are collectively referred to as &#8220;the Plans.&#8221; The 2015 Plan has substantially similar terms to the 2007 Plan and the 1997 Plan. Awards granted under the Plans for which common shares are not issued by reason of cancellation, forfeiture, lapse of such award or settlement of such award in cash, are again available under the 2015 Plan. All grants made after the approval of the 2015 Plan have been made pursuant to the 2015 Plan. As of December 31, 2019 , approximately 3.0 million shares were available for future grants (assuming the maximum number of shares are issued for the performance awards outstanding.) The Plans cover substantially all employees of Wintrust. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers all stock-based compensation programs and authorizes all awards granted pursuant to the Plans. 

The Plans permit the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, restricted share or unit awards, performance awards and other incentive awards valued in whole or in part by reference to the Company&#8217;s common stock, all on a stand-alone, combination or tandem basis. The Company historically awarded stock-based compensation in the form of time-vested nonqualified stock options and time-vested restricted share unit awards (&#8220;restricted shares&#8221;). In general, the grants of options provide for the purchase shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock at the fair market value of the stock on the date the options are granted. Options under the 2015 Plan and the 2007 Plan generally vest ratably over periods of three to five years and have a maximum term of seven years from the date of grant. Restricted shares entitle the holders to receive, at no cost, shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. Restricted shares generally vest over periods of one to five years from the date of grant. 

Beginning in 2011, the Company has awarded annual grants under the Long-Term Incentive Program (&#8220;LTIP&#8221;), which is administered under the Plans. The LTIP is designed in part to align the interests of management with interests of shareholders, foster retention, create a long-term focus based on sustainable results and provide participants a target long-term incentive opportunity. It is anticipated that LTIP awards will continue to be granted annually. LTIP grants since 2017 have consisted of performance-based stock and performance-based cash awards; however grants had previously included non-qualified stock options. Stock options granted under the LTIP have a term of seven years and will generally vest equally over three years based on continued service. Performance-based stock and cash awards granted under the LTIP are contingent upon the achievement of pre-established long-term performance goals set in advance by the Compensation Committee over a three-year period. These performance awards are granted at a target level, and based on the Company&#8217;s achievement of the pre-established long-term goals, the actual payouts can range from 0 % to 150 % of the target award. The awards typically vest in the quarter after the end of the performance period upon certification of the payout by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Holders of performance-based stock awards are entitled to receive, at no cost, the shares earned based on the achievement of the pre-established long-term goals. 

Holders of restricted share awards and performance-based stock awards received under the Plans are not entitled to vote or receive cash dividends (or cash payments equal to the cash dividends) on the underlying common shares until the awards are vested. Shares that are vested but are not issuable pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements accrue additional shares based on the value of dividends otherwise paid. 

Except in limited circumstances, unvested awards granted under the Plans are canceled upon termination of employment without any payment of consideration by the Company.

Stock-based compensation is measured as the fair value of an award on the date of grant, and the measured cost is recognized over the period which the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The fair values of restricted share and performance-based stock awards are determined based on the average of the high and low trading prices on the grant date, and the fair value of stock options is estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions and is sensitive to changes in the option&#8217;s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock, which can materially affect the fair value estimate. Options granted since the inception of the LTIP in 2011 were primarily granted as LTIP awards. Expected life of the options granted since the inception of the LTIP awards has been based on the safe harbor rule of the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 &#8220;Share-Based Payment&#8221; as the Company believes historical exercise data may not provide a reasonable basis to estimate the expected term of these options. Expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company&#8217;s common stock, which correlates with the expected life of the options. Management reviews and adjusts the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of an option on a periodic basis to better reflect expected trends during periods when options are granted. No options have been granted since 2016. 

Stock based compensation is recognized based on the number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical forfeiture experience. For performance-based stock awards, an estimate is made of the number of shares expected to vest as a result of actual performance against the performance criteria to determine the amount of compensation expense to be recognized. The estimate is reevaluated quarterly and total compensation expense is adjusted for any change in the current period. 

Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $ 11.3 million , $ 13.5 million and $ 12.9 million and the related tax benefits were $ 2.6 million , $ 3.1 million and $ 5.1 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively.

Aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pretax intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the Company&#8217;s stock price at year end and the option exercise price, multiplied by the number of shares) that would have been received by the option holders if they had exercised their options on the last day of the year. Options with exercise prices above the year end stock price are excluded from the calculation of intrinsic value. The intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of the Company&#8217;s stock.

At December 31, 2019, the maximum number of performance-based shares that could be issued on outstanding awards if performance is attained at the maximum amount was approximately 681,000 shares. 

The actual tax benefit realized upon the vesting of restricted shares and performance-based stock is based on the fair value of the shares on the issue date and the estimated tax benefit of the awards is based on fair value of the awards on the grant date. The actual tax benefit realized upon the vesting of restricted shares and performance-based stock in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 870,000 , $ 994,000 and $ 975,000 , respectively, more than the expected tax benefit for those shares. These differences in actual and expected tax benefits were recorded to income tax expense. 

As of December 31, 2019 , there was $ 10.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share based arrangements under the Plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years . The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 9.8 million , $ 8.0 million and $ 8.9 million , respectively. 

The Company issues new shares to satisfy its obligation to issue shares granted pursuant to the Plans. 

Cash Incentive and Retention Plan 

The Cash Incentive and Retention Plan (&#8220;CIRP&#8221;) allows the Company to provide cash compensation to the Company&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; officers and employees. The CIRP is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The CIRP generally provides for the grants of cash awards, which may be earned pursuant to the achievement of performance criteria established by the Compensation Committee and/or continued employment. The performance criteria, if any, established by the Compensation Committee must relate to one or more of the criteria specified in the CIRP, which includes: earnings, earnings growth, revenues, stock price, return on assets, return on equity, improvement of financial ratings, achievement of balance sheet or income statement objectives and expenses. These criteria may relate to the Company, a particular line of business or a specific subsidiary of the Company. The Company had no expense related to the CIRP in 2019, 2018 and 2017, and no awards were paid in those years. There were no outstanding awards under this plan at December 31, 2019 .

Other Employee Benefits 

Wintrust and its subsidiaries also provide 401(k) Retirement Savings Plans (&#8220;401(k) Plans&#8221;). The 401(k) Plans cover all employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. Contributions by employees are made through salary deferrals at their direction, subject to certain Plan and statutory limitations. Employer contributions to the 401(k) Plans are made at the employer&#8217;s discretion. Generally, participants completing 501 hours of service are eligible to share in an allocation of employer contributions. The Company&#8217;s expense for the employer contributions to the 401(k) Plans was approximately $ 12.3 million in 2019 , $ 10.4 million in 2018 , and $ 8.9 million in 2017 . 

The Wintrust Financial Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan (&#8220;ESPP&#8221;) is designed to encourage greater stock ownership among employees, thereby enhancing employee commitment to the Company. The ESPP gives eligible employees the right to accumulate funds over an offering period to purchase shares of common stock. All shares offered under the ESPP will be either newly issued shares of the Company or shares issued from treasury, if any. In accordance with the ESPP, beginning January 1, 2015, the purchase price of the shares of common stock is equal to 95 % of the closing price of the Company&#8217;s common stock on the last day of the offering period. During 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , 43,386 , 33,977 and 35,022 , respectively, shares of common stock were purchased by participants and no compensation expense was recorded. The Company plans to continue to offer common stock through this ESPP on an ongoing basis, and in 2018, increased the shares authorized under the ESPP by 200,000 shares. At December 31, 2019 , the Company had an obligation to issue 10,523 shares of common stock to participants and had 172,677 shares available for future grants under the ESPP. 

As a result of the Company's acquisition of HPK Financial Corporation (&#8220;HPK&#8221;) in December 2012, the Company assumed the obligations of a noncontributory pension plan. The HPK Plan was frozen as of December 31, 2006, with no additional credit earned for service or compensation paid after that date. Similarly, in connection with the Company's acquisition of Diamond Bancorp, Inc. ("Diamond") in October 2013, the Company assumed the obligation of Diamond's pension plan. The Diamond Plan was frozen as of December 31, 2004, and only service and compensation prior to this date is considered in determining benefits. In 2019, both of these plans were terminated and participant account balances were distributed. The Company recorded expense (income) of $ 487,000 , ($ 38,000 ) and $ 1.2 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, related to these plans. 

The Company does not currently offer other postretirement benefits such as health care or other pension plans. 

Directors Deferred Fee and Stock Plan 

The Wintrust Financial Corporation Directors Deferred Fee and Stock Plan (&#8220;DDFS Plan&#8221;) allows directors of the Company and its subsidiaries to choose to receive payment of directors&#8217; fees in either cash or common stock of the Company and to defer the receipt of the fees. The DDFS Plan is designed to encourage stock ownership by directors. All shares offered under the DDFS Plan will be either newly issued shares of the Company or shares issued from treasury. The number of shares issued is determined on a quarterly basis based on the fees earned during the quarter and the fair market value per share of the common stock on the last trading day of the preceding quarter. The shares are issued annually and the directors are entitled to dividends and voting rights upon the issuance of the shares. During 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , a total of 18,577 shares, 18,856 shares and 27,508 shares, respectively, were issued to directors. For those directors that elect to defer the receipt of the common stock, the Company maintains records of stock units representing an obligation to issue shares of common stock. The number of stock units equals the number of shares that would have been issued had the director not elected to defer receipt of the shares. Additional stock units are credited at the time dividends are paid, however no voting rights are associated with the stock units. The shares of common stock represented by the stock units are issued in the year specified by the directors in their participation agreements. At December 31, 2019 , the Company has an obligation to issue 295,228 shares of common stock to directors and has 42,311 shares available for future grants under the DDFS Plan. 

(19) Regulatory Matters 

Banking laws place restrictions upon the amount of dividends that can be paid to Wintrust by the banks. Based on these laws, the banks could, subject to minimum capital requirements, declare dividends to Wintrust without obtaining regulatory approval in an amount not exceeding (a) undivided profits, and (b) the amount of net income reduced by dividends paid for the current and prior two years. During 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , cash dividends totaling $ 139.0 million , $ 111.0 million and $ 122.0 million , respectively, were paid to Wintrust by the banks and other subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2019, before considering the impact of ASU No. 2016-13 and all subsequent updates issued to clarify and improve specific areas of this ASU, the banks had approximately $ 542.0 million available to be paid as dividends to Wintrust without prior regulatory approval and without reducing their capital below the well-capitalized level.

The banks are also required by the Federal Reserve Act to maintain reserves against deposits. Reserves are held either in the form of vault cash or balances maintained with the FRB and are based on the average daily deposit balances and statutory reserve ratios prescribed by the type of deposit account. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , reserve balances of approximately $ 750.0 million and $ 611.1 million , respectively, were required to be maintained at the FRB. 

The Company and the banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements established by the federal banking agencies that take into account risk attributable to balance sheet and off-balance sheet activities. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory &#8212; and possibly discretionary &#8212; actions by regulators, that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the banks must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company&#8217;s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. 

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the banks to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and Tier 1 leverage capital (as defined) to average quarterly assets (as defined). The Federal Reserve&#8217;s capital guidelines require bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0 % , of which at least 4.50 % must be in the form of Common Equity Tier 1 capital and 6.0 % must be in the form of Tier 1 capital. The Federal Reserve also requires a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets of 4.0 % . In addition the Federal Reserve continues to consider the Tier 1 leverage ratio in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities. 

As reflected in the following table, the Company met all minimum capital requirements at December 31, 2019 and 2018 :

Wintrust&#8217;s mortgage banking division and broker/dealer subsidiary are also required to maintain minimum net worth capital requirements with various governmental agencies. The mortgage banking division&#8217;s net worth requirements are governed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the broker/dealer&#8217;s net worth requirements are governed by the SEC. As of December 31, 2019 , these business units met their minimum net worth capital requirements. 

(20) Commitments and Contingencies 

The Company has outstanding, at any time, a number of commitments to extend credit. These commitments include revolving home equity line and other credit agreements, term loan commitments and standby and commercial letters of credit. Standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Standby letters of credit are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of the underlying contract with the third party, while commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate commerce and typically result in the commitment being drawn on when the underlying transaction is consummated between the customer and the third party. 

These commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Commitments to extend commercial, commercial real estate and construction loans totaled $ 5.1 billion and $ 4.7 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and unused home equity lines totaled $ 800.6 million and $ 807.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Standby and commercial letters of credit totaled $ 291.8 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 233.3 million at December 31, 2018 . 

In addition, at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company had approximately $ 595.1 million and $ 389.7 million , respectively, in commitments to fund residential mortgage loans to be sold into the secondary market. These lending commitments are also considered derivative instruments. The Company also enters into forward contracts for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans at specified interest rates to reduce the interest rate risk associated with commitments to fund loans as well as mortgage loans held-for-sale. These forward contracts are also considered derivative instruments and had contractual amounts of approximately $ 837.2 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 481.6 million at December 31, 2018 . See Note 21, &#8220;Derivative Financial Instruments,&#8221; for further discussion on derivative instruments. 

The Company enters into residential mortgage loan sale agreements with investors in the normal course of business. These agreements usually require certain representations concerning credit information, loan documentation, collateral and insurability. On occasion, investors have requested the Company to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans which the investors believe do not comply with applicable representations. Management maintains a liability for estimated losses on loans expected to be repurchased or on which indemnification is expected to be provided and regularly evaluates the adequacy

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

of this recourse liability based on trends in repurchase and indemnification requests, actual loss experience, known and inherent risks in the loans, and current economic conditions. 

The Company sold approximately $ 4.5 billion of mortgage loans in 2019 and $ 4.1 billion in 2018 . The liability for estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification claims for residential mortgage loans previously sold to investors was $ 2.4 million and $ 2.4 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and was included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Losses charged against the liability were $ 639,000 in 2019 as compared to $ 183,000 in 2018 . These losses relate to mortgages which experienced early payment and other defaults meeting certain representation and warranty recourse requirements. 

The Company has unfunded commitments to investment partnerships that qualify for CRA purposes totaling $ 29.3 million as of December 31, 2019 . Of these commitments, $ 323,000 related to legally-binding unfunded commitments for tax-credit investments and was included within other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 

The Company utilizes an out-sourced securities clearing platform and has agreed to indemnify the clearing broker of Wintrust Investments for losses that it may sustain from the customer accounts introduced by Wintrust Investments. As of December 31, 2019 , the total amount of customer balances maintained by the clearing broker and subject to indemnification was approximately $ 15.8 million . Wintrust Investments seeks to control the risks associated with its customers&#8217; activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with various regulatory and internal guidelines. 

In accordance with applicable accounting principles, the Company establishes an accrued liability for litigation and threatened litigation actions and proceedings when those actions present loss contingencies which are both probable and estimable. In actions for which a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, the Company determines whether it can estimate a loss or range of possible loss. To determine whether a possible loss is estimable, the Company reviews and evaluates its material litigation on an ongoing basis, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. This review may include information learned through the discovery process, rulings on substantive or dispositive motions, and settlement discussions. 

Lehman Holdings Matter 

On January 15, 2015, Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;Lehman Holdings&#8221;) sent a demand letter asserting that Wintrust Mortgage must indemnify it for losses arising from loans sold by Wintrust Mortgage to Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB under a Loan Purchase Agreement between Wintrust Mortgage, as successor to SGB Corporation, and Lehman Brothers Bank. The demand was the precursor for triggering the alternative dispute resolution process mandated by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Lehman Holdings triggered the mandatory alternative dispute resolution process on October 16, 2015. On February 3, 2016, following a ruling by the federal Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit that was adverse to Lehman Holdings on the statute of limitations that is applicable to similar loan purchase claims, Lehman Holdings filed a complaint against Wintrust Mortgage and 150 other entities from which it had purchased loans in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The mandatory mediation was held on March 16, 2016, but did not result in a consensual resolution of the dispute. The court entered a case management order governing the litigation on November 1, 2016. Lehman Holdings filed an amended complaint against Wintrust Mortgage on December 29, 2016. On March 31, 2017, Wintrust Mortgage moved to dismiss the amended complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and improper venue or to transfer venue. Argument on the motions to dismiss were heard on June 12, 2018. The motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was denied on August 14, 2018 and the defendants&#8217; motion to transfer venue was denied on October 2, 2018. Wintrust Mortgage appealed the denial of its motion to dismiss based on improper venue and the denial of its motion to transfer venue. 

On October 2, 2018, Lehman Holdings asked the court for permission to amend its complaints against Wintrust Mortgage and the other defendants to add loans allegedly purchased from the defendants and sold to various RMBS trusts. The court granted this request and allowed Lehman Holdings to assert the additional claims against existing defendants as a supplemental complaint. Lehman Holdings filed its supplemental complaint against Wintrust Mortgage on December 4, 2018. Wintrust Mortgage filed its response to the supplemental complaint on May 13, 2019. Wintrust Mortgage is currently evaluating whether it has obtained sufficient information to assess the merits of Lehman Holding&#8217;s additional claims and to estimate the likelihood or amount of any potential liability for the additional claims. 

The Company has reserved an amount for the Lehman Holdings action that is immaterial to its results of operations or financial condition. Such litigation and threatened litigation actions necessarily involve substantial uncertainty and it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate resolution or to determine whether, or to what extent, any loss with respect to these legal proceedings may exceed the amounts reserved by the Company.

JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co. Matter 

On April 9, 2018, JPMorgan Chase &#38; Co. as successor in interest to Bear Stearns and certain related Bear Stearns entities (collectively, &#8220;JPMC&#8221;) sent a demand letter to Wintrust Mortgage asserting an indemnification claim of approximately $ 4.6 million . JPMC alleges that it incurred this loss due to its reliance on misrepresentations in the loans Wintrust Mortgage originated, underwrote and sold to JPMC in the years prior to 2009. Wintrust Mortgage disputed JPMC&#8217;s allegations. On March 27, 2019, JPMC and Wintrust Mortgage settled the dispute for an immaterial amount. 

Wintrust Mortgage Matter 

On October 17, 2018, a former Wintrust Mortgage employee filed a lawsuit against Wintrust Mortgage in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles, alleging violation of California wage payment statutes on behalf of herself and all other hourly, non-exempt employees of Wintrust Mortgage in California from October 17, 2014 through the present. Wintrust Mortgage received service of the complaint on November 4, 2018. Wintrust Mortgage's response to the complaint was filed on February 25, 2019. On November 1, 2019, the plaintiff&#8217;s counsel filed a letter with the California Department of Labor advising that it was initiating an action under California&#8217;s Private Attorney General Act statute based on the same alleged violations. In November 2019, the parties reached a settlement agreement. The parties are documenting the settlement. Once finalized, the parties will submit the settlement to the court for approval. The Company has reserved an amount for this litigation that is immaterial to its results of operations or financial condition. Such litigation and threatened litigation actions necessarily involve substantial uncertainty and it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate resolution or to determine whether, or to what extent, any loss with respect to these legal proceedings may exceed the amounts reserved by the Company. 

Northbrook Bank Matter 

On October 17, 2018, two individual plaintiffs filed suit against Northbrook Bank and Tamer Moumen in the Circuit Court of Lake County, Illinois, on behalf of themselves and a class of approximately 42 investors in a hedge fund run by defendant Moumen, Plaintiffs allege that defendant Moumen ran a fraudulent Ponzi scheme and ran those funds through deposit accounts at Northbrook Bank. They allege the bank was negligent in failing to close the deposit accounts and that it intentionally aided and abetted defendant Moumen in the alleged fraud. They contend that Northbrook Bank is liable for losses in excess of $ 6 million . Northbrook Bank filed its motion to dismiss the complaint on January 15, 2019, which was granted on March 5, 2019. On April 3, 2019, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint based on similar allegations. Northbrook Bank believed the amended complaint did not cure the pleading defects recognized by the court and filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint on May 17, 2019. The court heard this motion on July 17, 2019 and once again dismissed the complaint without prejudice. Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on August 12, 2019. Northbrook again moved to dismiss the complaint. On November 6, 2019, the court dismissed the complaint with prejudice. Plaintiffs filed an appeal on December 2, 2019. Northbrook Bank believes plaintiffs&#8217; allegations are legally and factually meritless and otherwise lacks sufficient information to estimate the amount of any potential liability. 

Other Matters 

In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries, from time to time, are subject to pending and threatened legal action and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. 

Based on information currently available and upon consultation with counsel, management believes that the eventual outcome of any pending or threatened legal actions and proceedings described above, including our ordinary course litigation, will not have a material adverse effect on the operations or financial condition of the Company. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations or financial condition for a particular period. 

(21) Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company primarily enters into derivative financial instruments as part of its strategy to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivative instruments represent contracts between parties that result in one party delivering cash to the other party based on a notional amount and an underlying term (such as a rate, security price or price index) as specified in the contract. The amount of cash delivered from one party to the other is determined based on the interaction of the notional amount of the contract with the underlying term. Derivatives are also implicit in certain contracts and commitments. 

The derivative financial instruments currently used by the Company to manage its exposure to interest rate risk include: (1) interest rate swaps and collars to manage the interest rate risk of certain fixed and variable rate assets and variable rate liabilities; (2) interest rate lock commitments provided to customers to fund certain mortgage loans to be sold into the secondary market; (3) forward commitments for the future delivery of such mortgage loans to protect the Company from adverse changes in interest rates and 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

corresponding changes in the value of mortgage loans held-for-sale; (4) covered call options to economically hedge specific investment securities and receive fee income effectively enhancing the overall yield on such securities to compensate for net interest margin compression; and (5) options and swaps to economically hedge a portion of the fair value adjustments related to the Company's mortgage servicing rights portfolio. The Company also enters into derivatives (typically interest rate swaps) with certain qualified borrowers to facilitate the borrowers&#8217; risk management strategies and concurrently enters into mirror-image derivatives with a third party counterparty, effectively making a market in the derivatives for such borrowers. Additionally, the Company enters into foreign currency contracts to manage foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency denominated assets. 

The Company recognizes derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the instrument. The Company records derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Condition within accrued interest receivable and other assets and accrued interest payable and other liabilities, respectively. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in income or in shareholders&#8217; equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting and, if so, whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge. 

Changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges are recorded in income in the same period and in the same income statement line as changes in the fair values of the hedged items that relate to the hedged risk(s). Changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of deferred taxes, and reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments not designated in a hedging relationship pursuant to ASC 815 are reported in non-interest income during the period of the change. Derivative financial instruments are valued by a third party and are corroborated by comparison with valuations provided by the respective counterparties. Fair values of certain mortgage banking derivatives (interest rate lock commitments and forward commitments to sell mortgage loans) are estimated based on changes in mortgage interest rates from the date of the loan commitment. The fair value of foreign currency derivatives is computed based on changes in foreign currency rates stated in the contract compared to those prevailing at the measurement date. 

The table below presents the fair value of the Company&#8217;s derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 :

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 

The Company&#8217;s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to net interest income and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish these objectives, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate collars designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of amounts in which the interest rate specified in the contract exceeds the agreed upon cap strike price or the payment of amounts in which the interest rate specified in the contract is below the agreed upon floor strike price at the end of each period. 

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2019 , the Company had fifteen interest rate swap derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate deposits and certain junior subordinated debentures, and one interest rate collar derivative designated as a cash flow hedge of the Company&#8217;s variable rate Term Facility. When the relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument is highly effective at achieving offsetting changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and are subsequently reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on such variable rate deposits. The changes in fair value (net of tax) are separately disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 

The table below provides details on these cash flow hedges, summarized by derivative type and maturity, as of December 31, 2019 :

In 2018, the Company terminated five interest rate swap derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate deposits with a total notional value of $ 650.0 million . As the hedged forecasted transactions (interest payments on variable rate deposits) will still occur over the remaining term of the terminated derivatives, any prior changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges will continue to be included within accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to interest expense as interest payments continue to be made. In 2019 and 2018, the Company reclassified approximately $ 4.7 million and $ 427,000 , respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense related to these terminated interest rate swap derivatives. 

A rollforward of the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges follows:

Fair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 

Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the payment of fixed amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company has fifteen interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $ 162.9 million that were designated as fair value hedges primarily associated with fixed rate commercial and industrial and commercial real estate 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

loans as well as life insurance premium finance receivables. One of these interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $ 6.9 million has terms starting after December 31, 2019 . 

For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss from the entire change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recognized in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect, including the net gain or loss, of the hedged item (interest income earned on fixed rate loans) when the hedged item affects earnings. 

The following table presents the carrying amount of the hedged assets/(liabilities) and the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the hedged assets/(liabilities) that are designated as a fair value hedge accounting relationship as of December 31, 2019 :

In 2018, one interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge accounting relationship was terminated as a result of the full prepayment of the underlying loan (hedged asset). At the time of the termination, the fair value of the interest rate swap asset was approximately $ 1.4 million with an offsetting cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments included in the carrying value of the underlying loan totaling $ 1.6 million . As the underlying loan was fully paid-off, the remaining cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments included in the carrying value of the underlying loan was recorded to interest income. 

Non-Designated Hedges 

The Company does not use derivatives for speculative purposes. Derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are used to manage the Company&#8217;s economic exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements of ASC 815. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded directly in earnings. 

Interest Rate Derivatives &#8212;The Company has interest rate derivatives, including swaps and option products, resulting from a service the Company provides to certain qualified borrowers. The Company&#8217;s banking subsidiaries execute certain derivative products (typically interest rate swaps) directly with qualified commercial borrowers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. For example, these arrangements allow the Company&#8217;s commercial borrowers to effectively convert a variable rate loan to a fixed rate. In order to minimize the Company&#8217;s exposure on these transactions, the Company simultaneously executes offsetting derivatives with third parties. In most cases, the offsetting derivatives have mirror-image terms, which result in the positions&#8217; changes in fair value substantially offsetting through earnings each period. However, to the extent that the derivatives are not a mirror-image and because of differences in counterparty credit risk, changes in fair value will not completely offset resulting in some earnings impact each period. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in other non-interest income. At December 31, 2019 , the Company had interest rate derivative transactions with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $ 7.4 billion (all interest rate swaps and caps with customers and third parties) related to this program. These interest rate derivatives had maturity dates ranging from January 2020 to February 2045 .

Mortgage Banking Derivatives&#8212; These derivatives include interest rate lock commitments provided to customers to fund certain mortgage loans to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of such loans. It is the Company&#8217;s practice to enter into forward commitments for the future delivery of a portion of our residential mortgage loan production when interest rate lock commitments are entered into in order to economically hedge the effect of future changes in interest rates on its commitments to fund the loans as well as on its portfolio of mortgage loans held-for-sale. The Company&#8217;s mortgage banking derivatives have not been designated as being in hedge relationships. At December 31, 2019 , the Company had forward commitments to sell mortgage loans with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $ 837.2 million and interest rate lock commitments with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $ 454.6 million . The fair values of these derivatives were estimated based on changes in mortgage rates from the dates of the commitments. Changes in the fair value of these mortgage banking derivatives are included in mortgage banking revenue. 

Foreign Currency Derivatives&#8212; These derivatives include foreign currency contracts used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and transactions. Foreign currency contracts, which include spot and forward contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar-equivalent value of the foreign currency denominated assets or forecasted transactions increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to these foreign currency denominated assets or forecasted transactions are expected to substantially offset this variability. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company held foreign currency derivatives with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $ 34.5 million . 

Other Derivatives&#8212; Periodically, the Company will sell options to a bank or dealer for the right to purchase certain securities held within the banks&#8217; investment portfolios (covered call options). These option transactions are designed primarily to mitigate overall interest rate risk and to increase the total return associated with the investment securities portfolio. These options do not qualify as accounting hedges pursuant to ASC 815, and, accordingly, changes in fair value of these contracts are recognized as other non-interest income. There were no covered call options outstanding as of December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018 . 

Periodically, the Company will purchase options for the right to purchase securities not currently held within the banks' investment portfolios or enter into interest rate swaps in which the Company elects to not designate such derivatives as hedging instruments. These option and swap transactions are designed primarily to economically hedge a portion of the fair value adjustments related to the Company's mortgage servicing rights portfolio. The gain or loss associated with these derivative contracts are included in mortgage banking revenue. There were no such options outstanding as of December 31, 2019 . As of December 31, 2019 , the Company held four interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of $ 55.0 million for such purpose of economically hedging a portion of the fair value adjustment related to its mortgage servicing rights portfolio. 

Amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income related to derivative instruments not designated in hedge relationships were as follows:

Credit Risk 

Derivative instruments have inherent risks, primarily market risk and credit risk. Market risk is associated with changes in interest rates and credit risk relates to the risk that the counterparty will fail to perform according to the terms of the agreement. The amounts potentially subject to market and credit risks are the streams of interest payments under the contracts and the market value of the derivative instrument and not the notional principal amounts used to express the volume of the transactions. Market and credit risks are managed and monitored as part of the Company&#8217;s overall asset-liability management process, except that the credit risk related to derivatives entered into with certain qualified borrowers is managed through the Company&#8217;s standard loan underwriting process since these derivatives are secured through collateral provided by the loan agreements. Actual exposures are monitored against various types of credit limits established to contain risk within parameters. When deemed necessary, appropriate types and amounts of collateral are obtained to minimize credit exposure.

The Company has agreements with certain of its interest rate derivative counterparties that contain cross-default provisions, which provide that if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. The Company also has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision allowing the counterparty to terminate the derivative positions if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well or adequately capitalized institution, which would require the Company to settle its obligations under the agreements. As of December 31, 2019 , the fair value of interest rate derivatives in a net liability position that were subject to such agreements, which includes accrued interest related to these agreements, was $ 123.7 million . If the Company had breached any of these provisions and the derivatives were terminated as a result, the Company would have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value and would have been required to pay any additional amounts due in excess of amounts previously posted as collateral with the respective counterparty. 

The Company is also exposed to the credit risk of its commercial borrowers who are counterparties to interest rate derivatives with the banks. This counterparty risk related to the commercial borrowers is managed and monitored through the banks&#8217; standard underwriting process applicable to loans since these derivatives are secured through collateral provided by the loan agreement. The counterparty risk associated with the mirror-image swaps executed with third parties is monitored and managed in connection with the Company&#8217;s overall asset liability management process. 

The Company records interest rate derivatives subject to master netting agreements at their gross value and does not offset derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Condition.

(22) Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities 

The Company measures, monitors and discloses certain of its assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. These financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the observability of the inputs used to determine fair value. These levels are: 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Level 1 &#8212; unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Level 2 &#8212; inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; 

Level 3 &#8212; significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Company&#8217;s own assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 

##TABLE_END 

A financial instrument&#8217;s categorization within the above valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company&#8217;s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the assets or liabilities. Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

Available-for-sale debt securities, trading account securities and equity securities with readily determinable fair value &#8212;Fair values for available-for-sale debt securities, trading account securities and equity securities with readily determinable fair value are typically based on prices obtained from independent pricing vendors. Securities measured with these valuation techniques are generally classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Typically, standard inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades for similar securities, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including market research publications are used to fair value these securities. When these inputs are not available, broker/dealer quotes may be obtained by the vendor to determine the fair value of the security. We review the vendor&#8217;s pricing methodologies to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. Fair value measurements using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market due to limited activity or a less liquid market are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of U.S. Treasury securities and certain equity securities with readily determinable fair value are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. As such, these securities are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. 

The Company&#8217;s Investment Operations Department is responsible for the valuation of Level 3 available-for-sale debt securities. The methodology and variables used as inputs in pricing Level 3 securities are derived from a combination of observable and unobservable inputs. The unobservable inputs are determined through internal assumptions that may vary from period to period due to external factors, such as market movement and credit rating adjustments. 

At December 31, 2019 , the Company classified $ 112.0 million of municipal securities as Level 3. These municipal securities are bond issues for various municipal government entities primarily located in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin and are privately placed, non-rated bonds without CUSIP numbers. The Company also classified $ 2.6 million of U.S. Government agencies as Level 3 at December 31, 2019 . The Company&#8217;s methodology for pricing these securities focuses on three distinct inputs: equivalent rating, yield and other pricing terms. To determine the rating for a given non-rated municipal bond, the Investment Operations Department references a rated, publicly issued bond by the same issuer if available. A reduction is then applied to the rating obtained from the comparable bond, as the Company believes if liquidated, a non-rated bond would be valued less than a similar bond with a verifiable rating. The reduction applied by the Company is one complete rating grade (i.e. a &#8220;AA&#8221; rating for a comparable bond would be reduced to &#8220;A&#8221; for the Company&#8217;s valuation). For bond issues without comparable bond proxies, a rating of "BBB" was assigned. At the year ended 2019, all of the ratings derived by the Investment Operations Department using the above process were "BBB" or better. The fair value measurement of municipal bonds is sensitive to the rating input, as a higher rating typically results in an increased valuation. The remaining pricing inputs used in the bond valuation are observable. Based on the rating determined in the above process, Investment Operations obtains a corresponding current market yield curve available to market participants. Other terms including coupon, maturity date, redemption price, number of coupon payments per year, and accrual method are obtained from the individual bond term sheets. Certain municipal bonds held by the Company at December 31, 2019 are now continuously callable. When valuing these bonds, the fair value is capped at par value as the Company assumes a market participant would not pay more than par for a continuously callable bond. To determine the rating for the U.S. Government agency securities, the Investment Operations Department assigned a AAA rating as it is guaranteed by the U.S. government. 

Mortgage loans held-for-sale &#8212;The fair value of mortgage loans held-for-sale is determined by reference to investor price sheets for loan products with similar characteristics. As such, these loans are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

Loans held-for-investment &#8212;The fair value for loans in which the Company elected the fair value option is estimated by discounting future scheduled cash flows for the specific loan through maturity, adjusted for estimated credit losses and prepayments. The Company uses a discount rate based on the actual coupon rate of the underlying loan. At December 31, 2019 , the Company classified $ 9.6 million of loans held-for-investment as Level 3. The weighted average discount rate used as an input to value these loans at December 31, 2019 was 3.47 % with discount rates applied ranging from 3 % - 4 % . The higher the rate utilized to discount estimated future cash flows, the lower the fair value measurement. As noted above, the fair value estimate includes assumptions of prepayment speeds and credit losses. The Company included a prepayment speed assumption of 14.12 % at December 31, 2019 . Prepayment speeds are inversely related to the fair value of these loans as an increase in prepayment speeds results in a decreased valuation. Additionally, the weighted average credit discount used as an input to value the specific loans was 1.37 % with credit discounts ranging from 0 % - 8 % at December 31, 2019 . 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

MSRs &#8212;Fair value for MSRs is determined utilizing a valuation model which calculates the fair value of each servicing rights based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The Company uses a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with each servicing rights, given current market conditions. At December 31, 2019 , the Company classified $ 85.6 million of MSRs as Level 3. The weighted average discount rate used as an input to value the pool of MSRs at December 31, 2019 was 9.96 % with discount rates applied ranging from 7 % - 17 % . The higher the rate utilized to discount estimated future cash flows, the lower the fair value measurement. The fair value of MSRs was also estimated based on other assumptions including prepayment speeds and the cost to service. Prepayment speeds ranged from 0 % - 94 % or a weighted average prepayment speed of 14.12 % . Further, for current and delinquent loans, the Company assumed the weighted average cost of servicing of $ 77 and $ 396 , respectively, per loan. Prepayment speeds and the cost to service are both inversely related to the fair value of MSRs as an increase in prepayment speeds or the cost to service results in a decreased valuation. See Note 6, &#8220;Mortgage Servicing Rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;),&#8221; for further discussion of MSRs. 

Derivative instruments &#8212;The Company&#8217;s derivative instruments include interest rate swaps, caps and collars, commitments to fund mortgages for sale into the secondary market (interest rate locks), forward commitments to end investors for the sale of mortgage loans and foreign currency contracts. Interest rate swaps, caps and collars are valued by a third party, using models that primarily use market observable inputs, such as yield curves, and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The credit risk associated with derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements is measured on a net basis by counterparty portfolio. The fair value for mortgage-related derivatives is based on changes in mortgage rates from the date of the commitments. The fair value of foreign currency derivatives is computed based on change in foreign currency rates stated in the contract compared to those prevailing at the measurement date. 

At December 31, 2019 , the Company classified $ 2.6 million of derivative assets related to interest rate locks as Level 3. The fair value of interest rate locks is based on prices obtained for loans with similar characteristics from third parties, adjusted for the pull-through rate, which represents the Company&#8217;s best estimate of the likelihood that a committed loan will ultimately fund. The weighted-average pull-through rate at December 31, 2019 was 81.86 % with pull-through rates applied ranging from 23 % to 100 % . Pull-through rates are directly related to the fair value of interest rate locks as an increase in the pull-through rate results in an increased valuation. 

Nonqualified deferred compensation assets &#8212;The underlying assets relating to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan are included in a trust and primarily consist of non-exchange traded institutional funds which are priced based by an independent third party service. These assets are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Also, the Company may be required, from time to time, to measure certain other financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from impairment charges on individual assets. For assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis that were still held in the balance sheet at the end of the period, the following table provides the carrying value of the related individual assets or portfolios at December 31, 2019 .

Impaired loans &#8212;A loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due pursuant to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. A loan modified in a TDR is an impaired loan according to applicable accounting guidance. Impairment is measured by estimating the fair value of the loan based 

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

on the present value of expected cash flows, the market price of the loan, or the fair value of the underlying collateral. Impaired loans are considered a fair value measurement where an allowance is established based on the fair value of collateral. Appraised values, which may require adjustments to market-based valuation inputs, are generally used on real estate collateral-dependent impaired loans. 

The Company&#8217;s Managed Assets Division is primarily responsible for the valuation of Level 3 inputs of impaired loans. For more information on the Managed Assets Division review of impaired loans refer to Note 5 &#8211; Allowance for Loan Losses, Allowance for Losses on Lending-Related Commitments and Impaired Loans. At December 31, 2019 , the Company had $ 120.0 million of impaired loans classified as Level 3. Of the $ 120.0 million of impaired loans, $ 90.3 million were measured at fair value based on the underlying collateral of the loan as shown in the table above. The remaining $ 29.7 million were valued based on discounted cash flows in accordance with ASC 310. 

Other real estate owned &#8212;Other real estate owned is comprised of real estate acquired in partial or full satisfaction of loans and is included in other assets. Other real estate owned is recorded at its estimated fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of transfer, with any excess of the related loan balance over the fair value less expected selling costs charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent changes in value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount and are recorded in other non-interest expense. Gains and losses upon sale, if any, are also charged to other non-interest expense. Fair value is generally based on third party appraisals and internal estimates that are adjusted by a discount representing the estimated cost of sale and is therefore considered a Level 3 valuation. 

The Company&#8217;s Managed Assets Division is primarily responsible for the valuation of Level 3 inputs for other real estate owned. At December 31, 2019 , the Company had $ 15.2 million of other real estate owned classified as Level 3. The unobservable input applied to other real estate owned relates to the 10 % reduction to the appraisal value representing the estimated cost of sale of the foreclosed property. A higher discount for the estimated cost of sale results in a decreased carrying value. 

The valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used to measure both recurring and non-recurring Level 3 fair value measurements at December 31, 2019 were as follows:

##TABLE_END

Not all the financial instruments listed in the table above are subject to the disclosure provisions of ASC Topic 820, as certain assets and liabilities result in their carrying value approximating fair value. These include cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing deposits with banks, brokerage customer receivables, FHLB and FRB stock, accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable and non-maturity deposits. 

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair values of financial instruments that were not previously disclosed. 

Held-to-maturity securities. Held-to-maturity securities include U.S. Government-sponsored agency securities and municipal bonds issued by various municipal government entities primarily located in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin. Fair values for held-to-maturity securities are typically based on prices obtained from independent pricing vendors. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has generally categorized these held-to-maturity securities as a Level 2 fair value measurement. Fair values for certain other held-to-maturity securities are based on the bond pricing methodology discussed previously related to certain available-for-sale securities. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized these held-to-maturity securities as a Level 3 fair value measurement. 

Loans held-for-investment, at amortized cost. Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are analyzed by type such as commercial, residential real estate, etc. Each category is further segmented by interest rate type (fixed and variable) and term. For variable-rate loans that reprice frequently, estimated fair values are based on carrying values. The fair value of residential loans is based on secondary market sources for securities backed by similar loans, adjusted for differences in loan characteristics. The fair value for other fixed rate loans is estimated by discounting scheduled cash flows

&#160; 

##TABLE_END

through the estimated maturity using estimated market discount rates that reflect credit and interest rate risks inherent in the loan. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized loans as a Level 3 fair value measurement. 

Deposits with stated maturities. The fair value of certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently in effect for deposits of similar remaining maturities. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized deposits with stated maturities as a Level 3 fair value measurement. 

FHLB advances. The fair value of FHLB advances is obtained from the FHLB, which uses a discounted cash flow analysis based on current market rates of similar maturity debt securities to discount cash flows. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized FHLB advances as a Level 3 fair value measurement. 

Subordinated notes. The fair value of the subordinated notes is based on a market price obtained from an independent pricing vendor. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized subordinated notes as a Level 2 fair value measurement. 

Junior subordinated debentures. The fair value of the junior subordinated debentures is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized junior subordinated debentures as a Level 3 fair value measurement.

(24) Segment Information 

The Company&#8217;s operations consist of three primary segments: community banking, specialty finance and wealth management. 

The three reportable segments are strategic business units that are separately managed as they offer different products and services and have different marketing strategies. In addition, each segment&#8217;s customer base has varying characteristics and each segment has a different regulatory environment. While the Company&#8217;s management monitors each of the fifteen bank subsidiaries&#8217; operations and profitability separately, these subsidiaries have been aggregated into one reportable operating segment due to the similarities in products and services, customer base, operations, profitability measures and economic characteristics. 

For purposes of internal segment profitability, management allocates certain intersegment and parent company balances. Management allocates a portion of revenues to the specialty finance segment related to loans and leases originated by the specialty finance segment and sold or assigned to the community banking segment. Similarly, for purposes of analyzing the contribution from the wealth management segment, management allocates a portion of the net interest income earned by the community banking segment on deposit balances of customers of the wealth management segment to the wealth management segment. See Note 10, &#8220;Deposits,&#8221; for more information on these deposits. Finally, expenses incurred at the Wintrust parent company are allocated to each segment based on each segment's risk-weighted assets. 

The segment financial information provided in the following tables has been derived from the internal profitability reporting system used by management to monitor and manage the financial performance of the Company. The accounting policies of the segments are substantially similar to those described in the "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Note 1. The Company evaluates segment performance based on after-tax profit or loss and other appropriate profitability measures common to each segment.

##TABLE_END

Potentially dilutive common shares can result from stock options, restricted stock unit awards, stock warrants, the Company&#8217;s convertible preferred stock and shares to be issued under the ESPP and the DDFS Plan, being treated as if they had been either exercised or issued, computed by application of the treasury stock method. While potentially dilutive common shares are typically included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from this computation in periods in which the effect would reduce the loss per share or increase the income per share. For diluted earnings per share, net income applicable to common shares can be affected by the conversion of any convertible preferred stock. Where the effect of this conversion would reduce the loss per share or increase the income per share, net income applicable to common shares is not adjusted by the associated preferred dividends.
