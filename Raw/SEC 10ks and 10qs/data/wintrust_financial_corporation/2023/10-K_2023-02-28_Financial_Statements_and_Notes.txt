 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Wintrust Financial Corporation 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of condition of Wintrust Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 28, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter 

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. 

##TABLE_START Allowance for credit losses Description of the Matter At December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio totaled $39.2 billion and the associated Allowance for credit losses (ACL) was $357.4 million. As more fully described in Notes (1) and (5) to the consolidated financial statements, the ACL represents management&#8217;s estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual term of the loan. The ACL is measured on a collective or pooled basis when assets share the same risk characteristics or on an individual basis when assets do not share similar risk characteristics. For assets measured on a collective basis, the Company applies modeling methodologies that utilize the Company's historical loss experience to estimate lifetime credit loss rates on each pool, including methodologies estimating the probability of default and loss given default on specific segments. The historical credit loss experience utilized in the ACL models is adjusted for the Company&#8217;s reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. The modeled results are then adjusted for certain qualitative factors. For assets measured on an individual basis, the Company measures the expected losses primarily based on the estimated collateral value. 

Auditing management&#8217;s estimate of the ACL was especially challenging due to the complexity of the Company's ACL models and the significant judgement required in establishing management's reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. 

How we Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the ACL process, including among other things, controls over management&#8217;s process of assessing and challenging the reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, the development, operation and monitoring of the ACL models, and the completeness and accuracy of key inputs and assumptions used in the ACL models. 

To test the Company&#8217;s ACL models, we involved our specialists to test a sample of the ACL models by evaluating model methodology, model performance and testing key modeling assumptions. Additionally, we tested the accuracy of data utilized by the models by agreeing key data fields to source documentation and performed targeted re-calculations for a sample of models. 

To test the reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, our audit procedures included among others, evaluating the basis of the economic forecast factors utilized by management and testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by management to develop the economic forecasts. 

In addition, we evaluated the overall ACL and whether the ACL appropriately reflects expected lifetime losses in the loan portfolio as of the consolidated balance sheet date. For example, we compared the overall ACL amount to those established by similar banking institutions with similar loan portfolios.

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The accounting and reporting policies of Wintrust Financial Corporation (&#8220;Wintrust&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) and its subsidiaries conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and prevailing practices of the banking industry. In the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts contained in the consolidated financial statements. Management believes that the estimates made are reasonable; however, changes in estimates may be required if economic or other conditions change beyond management&#8217;s expectations. Reclassifications of certain prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation. The following is a summary of the Company&#8217;s significant accounting policies. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements of Wintrust include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. 

Earnings per Share 

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then share in the earnings of the Company. The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding is increased by the assumed conversion of any outstanding convertible preferred stock shares from the beginning of the year or date of issuance, if later, and the number of common shares that would be issued assuming the exercise of stock options and the issuance of restricted shares using the treasury stock method. The adjustments to the weighted-average common shares outstanding are only made when such adjustments will dilute earnings per common share. If relevant convertible preferred shares are outstanding during a period, net income applicable to common shares used in the diluted earnings per share calculation may be adjusted to consider potential conversion of such preferred shares. Where the effect of this conversion would reduce the loss per share or increase the income per share, net income applicable to common shares is not adjusted by the associated preferred dividends. 

Business Combinations 

The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, &#8220;Business Combinations&#8221; (&#8220;ASC 805&#8221;) when it obtains control of a business. When determining whether a business has been acquired, the Company first evaluates whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired are concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If concentrated in such a manner, the set of assets and activities is not a business. If not concentrated in such a manner, the Company assesses whether the set meets the definition of a business by containing inputs, outputs and at least one substantive process. If the set represents a business, the Company recognizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, immediately expenses transaction costs and accounts for restructuring plans separately from the business combination. The excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Alternatively, a gain is recorded equal to the amount by which the fair value of assets purchased exceeds the fair value of liabilities assumed and consideration paid. 

If the set of assets and activities do not constitute a business, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. The cost of a group of assets acquired is allocated to the individual assets acquired or liabilities assumed based on the relative fair value and does not result in the recognition of goodwill. Generally, any excess of the cost of the transaction over the fair value of the individual assets acquired or liabilities assumed, or, in contrast, any excess of the fair value of the individual assets acquired or liabilities assumed over the cost of the transaction, should be allocated on a relative fair value basis. Certain "non-qualifying" assets are excluded from this allocation, and are recognized at the individual asset's fair value. 

Results of operations of the acquired business are included in the income statement from the effective date of acquisition. Subsequent adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified in reporting periods within one year after the acquisition date in a business combination are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.

Cash Equivalents 

For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, Wintrust considers cash on hand, cash items in the process of collection, non-interest bearing amounts due from correspondent banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements with original maturities of three months or less, to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2021, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition included approximately $ 700.0 million of securities sold under agreements to repurchase with original maturities exceeding three months. As a result, such balance was not considered a cash equivalent for purposes of the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the respective period. There were no securities sold under agreements to repurchase with original maturities exceeding three months at December 31, 2022. 

Investment Securities 

The Company classifies debt and equity securities upon purchase in one of five categories: trading, held-to-maturity debt securities, available-for-sale debt securities, equity securities with a readily determinable fair value or equity securities without a readily determinable fair value. Debt and equity securities held for resale are classified as trading securities. Debt securities for which the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. All other debt securities are classified as available-for-sale as they may be sold prior to maturity in response to changes in the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk profile, funding needs, demand for collateralized deposits by public entities or other reasons. Equity securities are classified based upon whether a readily determinable fair value exists on such security. The fair value of an equity security is readily determinable if it meets certain conditions, including whether sales prices or bid-ask quotes are currently available on certain securities exchanges; traded only in a foreign market that is of a breadth and scope comparable to one of the U.S. markets; or the security is an investment in a mutual fund or similar structure with a fair value per share or unit that is determined and published, and is the basis for current transactions. 

Held-to-maturity debt securities are stated at amortized cost, which represents actual cost adjusted for premium amortization and discount accretion using methods that approximate the effective interest method. Available-for-sale debt securities are stated at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of related taxes, included in shareholders&#8217; equity as a separate component of other comprehensive income. Trading account securities and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are stated at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from sales and fair value adjustments are included in other non-interest income. Equity securities without a readily determinable fair value are stated at either a calculated net asset value per share, if available, or the cost of the security minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar instrument of the same issuer. 

Subsequent to classification at the time of purchase, the Company may transfer debt securities between trading, held-to-maturity, or available-for-sale. For debt securities transferred to trading, the current unrealized gain or loss at the date of transfer, net of related taxes, is immediately recognized in earnings. Debt securities transferred from trading to either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale have already recognized any unrealized gain or loss into earnings and this amount is not reversed. Unrealized gains or losses, net related taxes, for available-for-sale debt securities transferred to held-to-maturity remain as a separate component of other comprehensive income and an offsetting discount is included in the amortized cost of the held-to-maturity debt security. These amounts are amortized over the remaining life of the debt security in equal and offsetting amounts. Unrealized gains or losses for held-to-maturity debt securities transferred to available-for-sale are recognized at the transfer date as a separate component of other comprehensive income, net of related taxes. 

Declines in the fair value of held-to-maturity and available-for-sale debt investment securities (with certain exceptions for debt securities noted below) that are deemed to be credit losses are charged to the allowance for credit losses. In evaluating credit impairment, management considers the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value in the near term. Declines in the fair value of debt securities below amortized cost are deemed to be credit losses in circumstances where: (1) the Company has the intent to sell a security; (2) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security. If the Company intends to sell a debt security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security before recovery, a credit impairment write-down is recognized in the allowance for credit losses equal to the difference between the debt security&#8217;s amortized cost basis and its fair value. If an entity does not intend to sell the debt security or it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security before recovery, the credit impairment write-down is separated into an amount representing credit loss, which is recognized in the allowance for credit losses, and an amount related to all other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income. 

##TABLE_START 101 

##TABLE_END

Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Such investments are included within accrued interest receivable and other assets within the Company's Consolidated Statements of Condition. 

Interest and dividends, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, are recognized as interest income when earned. Realized gains and losses on sales (using the specific identification method), unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are included in non-interest income. 

FHLB and FRB Stock 

Investments in FHLB and FRB stock are restricted as to redemption and are carried at cost. 

Securities Purchased Under Resale Agreements and Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements 

Securities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold under repurchase agreements are generally treated as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the amount at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. Securities, consisting of U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency and mortgage-backed securities, pledged as collateral under these financing arrangements cannot be sold by the secured party. The fair value of collateral either received from or provided to a third party is monitored and additional collateral is obtained or requested to be returned as deemed appropriate. 

Brokerage Customer Receivables 

The Company, under an agreement with an out-sourced securities clearing firm, extends credit to its brokerage customers to finance their purchases of securities on margin. The Company receives income from interest charged on such extensions of credit. Brokerage customer receivables represent amounts due on margin balances. Securities owned by customers are held as collateral for these receivables. 

Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale 

Mortgage loans are classified as held-for-sale when originated or acquired with the intent to sell the loan into the secondary market. ASC 825, &#8220;Financial Instruments&#8221; provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Mortgage loans classified as held-for-sale are measured at fair value which is typically determined by reference to investor prices for loan products with similar characteristics. Changes in fair value are recognized in mortgage banking revenue. 

Market conditions or other developments may change management&#8217;s intent with respect to the disposition of these loans and loans previously classified as mortgage loans held-for-sale may be reclassified to the loans held-for-investment portfolio, with the balance transferred continuing to be carried at fair value. 

Loans and Leases 

Loans are generally reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income. Interest income is recognized when earned. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and amortized over the expected life of the loan as an adjustment to the yield using methods that approximate the effective interest method. Finance charges on premium finance receivables are earned over the term of the loan, using a method which approximates the effective yield method. 

Leases classified as direct financing leases are included within lease loans for financial statement purposes. Direct financing leases are stated as the sum of remaining minimum lease payments from lessees plus estimated residual values less unearned lease income. Unearned lease income on direct financing leases is recognized over the term of the leases using the effective interest method. 

Interest income is not accrued on loans where management has determined that the borrowers may be unable to meet contractual principal or interest obligations, or where interest or principal is 90 days or more past due, unless the loans are adequately secured and in the process of collection. Cash receipts on non-accrual loans are generally applied to the principal balance until the remaining balance is considered collectible, at which time interest income may be recognized when received. 

##TABLE_START 102 

##TABLE_END

Allowance for Credit Losses 

In accordance with ASC 326, &#8220;Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses&#8221; (&#8220;ASC 326&#8221;), the Company measures the allowance for credit losses at the time of origination or purchase of a financial asset, representing an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses on the related asset. Financial assets include assets measured under the amortized cost basis, including loans, net investments in leases recognized by a lessor, held-to-maturity debt securities and purchased credit deteriorated (&#8220;PCD&#8221;) assets at the time of and subsequent to acquisition, and off-balance-sheet credit exposures considered not unconditionally cancellable. In addition to financial assets measured at amortized cost, credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities are recorded through the allowance for credit losses and not as a direct adjustment to the amortized cost of the securities. The Company elects the collateral maintenance practical expedient under ASC 326 and applies this approach to securities purchased under resale agreements and brokerage customer receivables. In accordance with contractual terms, these assets require underlying collateral to be monitored continuously and replenished when collateral is less than required levels. The Company measures an allowance for credit losses if the carrying balance of such assets exceeds the amount of underlying collateral. 

The allowance for credit losses on financial assets held at amortized cost is measured on a collective or pooled basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The Company utilizes modeling methodologies that estimate lifetime credit loss rates on each pool, including methodologies estimating the probability of default and loss given default on specific segments. Credit quality indicators, specifically the Company's internal risk rating systems, reflect how the Company monitors credit losses and represent factors used by the Company when measuring the allowance for credit losses. Historical credit loss history is adjusted for reasonable and supportable forecasts developed by the Company and incorporates third party economic forecasts on a quantitative or qualitative basis. Reasonable and supportable forecasts consider the macroeconomic factors that are most relevant to evaluating and predicting expected credit losses in the Company's financial assets. For periods beyond the ability to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts, the Company reverts to historical loss rates. Qualitative factors assessed by Management include the following: 

&#8226; Changes in the nature and volume of the institution&#8217;s financial assets; 

&#8226; Changes in the existence, growth, and effect of any concentrations of credit; 

&#8226; Changes in the volume and severity of past due financial assets, the volume of non-accrual assets, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded assets; 

&#8226; Changes in the value of the underlying collateral for loans that are not collateral-dependent; 

&#8226; Changes in the institution&#8217;s lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and practices for collections, write-offs, and recoveries; 

&#8226; Changes in the quality of the institution&#8217;s credit review function; 

&#8226; Changes in the experience, ability, and depth of the institution&#8217;s lending, investment, collection, and other relevant management and staff; 

&#8226; The effect of changes in other external factors such as the regulatory, legal and technological environments; competition; and events such as natural disasters; and 

&#8226; Actual and expected changes in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments in which the institution operates that affect the collectability of financial assets. 

Expected credit losses are measured over the contractual term of the financial asset with consideration of expected prepayments. Expected extensions, renewals or modifications of the financial asset are considered when either (1) the expected extension, renewal or modification is contained within the existing agreement and is not unconditionally cancellable, or (2) the expected extension, renewal or modification is reasonably expected to result in a troubled debt restructuring (&#8220;TDR&#8221;). 

Financial assets that do not share similar risk characteristics with any pool are assessed for the allowance for credit losses on an individual basis. These typically include assets experiencing financial difficulties, including substandard non-accrual assets and assets currently classified or expected to be classified as TDRs. If an individual asset is removed from a pool, the allowance for credit losses for such pool will be measured without considering the removed asset. If foreclosure is probable or the asset is considered collateral-dependent, expected credit losses are measured based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral adjusted for selling costs, if appropriate. For certain accruing current and expected TDRs, expected credit losses are measured based upon the present value of future cash flows of the modified asset terms compared to the amortized cost of the asset. 

For purchased financial assets that have experienced more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination (&#8220;PCD assets&#8221;), the Company recognizes the sum of the purchase price and estimate of the allowance for credit losses as of the date of acquisition as the initial amortized cost basis. If the estimated allowance for credit losses is recognized under a methodology that is not a discounted cash flow methodology, such allowance for credit losses will be estimated based upon the unpaid principal balance of the financial asset. 

The Company does not measure an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable balances if these balances are written off in a timely manner. Write-offs of accrued interest receivable balances are recorded as a reduction to interest income. 

##TABLE_START 103 

##TABLE_END

Recoveries of financial assets previously written off are recognized when received and recorded as a component of the allowance for credit losses. When measuring the allowance for credit losses, the Company incorporates an estimate of expected recoveries provided the estimate is reasonable and supportable. Write-offs of financial assets are charged-off or deducted from the allowance for credit losses and recorded in the period when the Company concludes that all or a portion of a financial asset is no longer collectible. A provision for credit losses is charged to income based on Management&#8217;s periodic evaluation of the factors previously described. Evaluations are conducted at least quarterly and more frequently if deemed necessary. 

Mortgage Servicing Rights ("MSRs") 

MSRs are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Condition at fair value in accordance with ASC 860, &#8220;Transfers and Servicing.&#8221; The Company originates mortgage loans for sale to the secondary market. Certain loans are originated and sold with servicing rights retained. MSRs associated with loans originated and sold, where servicing is retained, are capitalized at the time of sale at fair value based on the future net cash flows expected to be realized for performing the servicing activities, and included in other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. The change in the fair value of MSRs is recorded as a component of mortgage banking revenue in non-interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company measures the fair value of MSRs by stratifying the servicing rights into pools based on homogeneous characteristics, such as product type and interest rate. The fair value of each servicing rights pool is calculated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with that pool, given current market conditions. Estimates of fair value include assumptions about prepayment speeds, interest rates and other factors which are subject to change over time. Changes in these underlying assumptions could cause the fair value of MSRs to change significantly in the future. 

Lease Investments 

The Company&#8217;s investments in equipment and other assets held on operating leases are reported as lease investments, net. Rental income on operating leases is recognized as income over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Equipment and other assets held on operating leases is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of the cost of the assets held on operating leases, less any residual value, is computed using the straight-line method over the term of the leases, which is generally seven years or less. 

Premises and Equipment 

Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Useful lives generally range from two to 15 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment, two to seven years for software and computer-related equipment and seven to 39 years for buildings and improvements. Land improvements are amortized over a period of 15 years and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the respective lease including any lease renewals deemed to be reasonably assured. Land, antique furnishings and artwork are not subject to depreciation. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized, and maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Eligible costs related to the configuration, coding, testing and installation of internal use software and qualifying cloud computing arrangements are capitalized. 

Long-lived depreciable assets are evaluated periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment exists when the expected undiscounted future cash flows of a long-lived asset are less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset based on a quoted market price, if applicable, or a discounted cash flow analysis. Impairment losses are recognized in other non-interest expense. 

Other Real Estate Owned 

Other real estate owned is comprised of real estate acquired in partial or full satisfaction of loans and is included in other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Other real estate owned is recorded at its estimated fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of transfer. Any excess of the related loan balance over the fair value less expected selling costs is charged to the allowance for credit losses. In contrast, any excess of the fair value less expected selling costs over the related loan balance is recorded as a recovery of prior charge-offs on the loan and, if any portion of the excess exceeds prior charge-offs, as an increase to earnings. Subsequent changes in value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount, limited to the initial fair value recorded at the date of transfer, and are recorded in other non-interest expense. Gains and losses upon sale, if any, are also charged to other non-interest expense. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, other real estate owned totaled $ 9.9 million and $ 4.3 million, respectively. 

##TABLE_START 104 

##TABLE_END

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. In accordance with accounting standards, goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when events warrant, using a qualitative or quantitative approach. Intangible assets which have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and also are subject to impairment testing. Intangible assets which have indefinite lives are evaluated each reporting date to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If an indefinite useful life can no longer be supported for such asset, the intangible asset will be amortized prospectively over the remaining estimated useful life. If an indefinite useful life can be supported, the asset is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when events warrant, using a qualitative or quantitative approach. The Company&#8217;s intangible assets having finite lives are amortized over varying periods not exceeding twenty years . 

Bank-Owned Life Insurance ("BOLI") 

The Company maintains BOLI on certain executives. BOLI balances are recorded at their cash surrender values and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Changes in the cash surrender values are included in non-interest income. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, BOLI totaled $ 157.3 million and $ 157.7 million, respectively. 

Derivative Instruments 

The Company enters into derivative transactions principally to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements on the future cash flows or the value of certain assets and liabilities. The Company is also required to recognize certain contracts and commitments, including certain commitments to fund mortgage loans held-for-sale, as derivatives when the characteristics of those contracts and commitments meet the definition of a derivative. The Company accounts for derivatives in accordance with ASC 815, &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging,&#8221; which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Condition at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. 

Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or liability attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Formal documentation of the relationship between a derivative instrument and a hedged asset or liability, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction and an assessment of effectiveness, is required at inception to apply hedge accounting. In addition, formal documentation of ongoing effectiveness testing is required to maintain hedge accounting. 

Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and the changes in the fair value related to the risk being hedged of the hedged asset or liability on the statement of condition with corresponding offsets recorded in the income statement. The adjustment to the hedged asset or liability is included in the basis of the hedged item, while the fair value of the derivative is recorded as a freestanding asset or liability. Actual cash receipts or payments and related amounts accrued during the period on derivatives included in a fair value hedge relationship are recorded as adjustments to the interest income or expense recorded on the hedged asset or liability. 

Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument on the statement of condition as either a freestanding asset or liability, with a corresponding offset recorded in other comprehensive income within shareholders&#8217; equity, net of deferred taxes. Amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense in the period or periods the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. 

Under both the fair value and cash flow hedge scenarios, changes in the fair value of derivatives not considered to be highly effective in hedging the change in fair value or the expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized in earnings as non-interest income during the period of the change. 

Derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges according to accounting guidance are reported on the statement of condition at fair value and the changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as non-interest income during the period of the change. 

##TABLE_START 105 

##TABLE_END

Commitments to fund mortgage loans (i.e. interest rate locks) to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of these mortgage loans are accounted for as derivatives and are not designated in hedging relationships. Fair values of these mortgage derivatives are estimated primarily based on changes in mortgage rates from the date of the commitments. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives are included in mortgage banking revenue. 

Forward currency and commodity contracts used to manage foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk, respectively, associated with certain assets are accounted for as derivatives and are not designated in hedging relationships. Such derivatives are recorded at fair value based on prevailing currency and commodity exchange rates at the measurement date. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings as non-interest income during the period of change. 

Periodically, the Company sells options to an unrelated bank or dealer for the right to purchase certain securities held within its investment portfolios (&#8220;covered call options&#8221;). These option transactions are designed primarily as an economic hedge to compensate for net interest margin compression by increasing the total return associated with holding the related securities as earning assets by using fee income generated from these options. These transactions are not designated in hedging relationships pursuant to accounting guidance and, accordingly, changes in fair values of these contracts, are reported in other non-interest income. 

The Company periodically purchases options for the right to purchase securities not currently held within its investment portfolios or enters into interest rate swaps in which the Company elects to not designate such derivatives as hedging instruments. These option and swap transactions are designed primarily to economically hedge a portion of the fair value adjustments related to the Company&#8217;s mortgage servicing rights portfolio. The gain or loss associated with these derivative contracts are included in mortgage banking revenue. 

Trust Assets, Assets Under Management and Brokerage Assets 

Assets held in fiduciary or agency capacity for customers are not included in the consolidated financial statements as they are not assets of Wintrust or its subsidiaries. Fee income is recognized on an accrual basis and is included as a component of non-interest income. 

Income Taxes 

Wintrust and its subsidiaries file a consolidated Federal income tax return. Income tax expense is based upon income in the consolidated financial statements rather than amounts reported on the income tax return. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using currently enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as an income tax benefit or income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. 

Positions taken in the Company&#8217;s tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, uncertain tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the positions will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions are both initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 % likely of being realized upon settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Interest and penalties on income tax uncertainties are classified within income tax expense in the income statement. 

Stock-Based Compensation Plans 

In accordance with ASC 718, &#8220;Compensation &#8212; Stock Compensation,&#8221; compensation cost is measured as the fair value of the awards on their date of grant. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options and a Monte-Carlo simulation model is used to estimate the fair value of performance awards with a market condition metric. The market price of the Company&#8217;s stock at the date of grant is used to estimate the fair value of time-vested restricted stock awards and performance awards with a performance metric. Compensation cost is recognized over the required service period, generally defined as the vesting period. For awards with graded vesting, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. 

Accounting guidance permits for the recognition of stock based compensation for the number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest. As a result, recognized compensation expense for stock options and restricted share awards is reduced for estimated forfeitures prior to vesting. Forfeitures rates are estimated for each type of award based on historical forfeiture 

##TABLE_START 106 

##TABLE_END

experience. Estimated forfeitures will be reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstances. The Company issues new shares to satisfy option exercises and vesting of restricted shares. 

Comprehensive Income 

Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, net of deferred taxes, changes in deferred gains and losses on investment securities transferred from available-for-sale debt securities to held-to-maturity debt securities, net of deferred taxes, adjustments related to cash flow hedges, net of deferred taxes, and foreign currency translation adjustments, net of deferred taxes. The Company has a policy for releasing the income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income using an individual security approach. 

Stock Repurchases 

The Company periodically repurchases shares of its outstanding common stock through open market purchases or other methods. Repurchased shares are recorded as treasury shares on the trade date using the treasury stock method, and the cash paid is recorded as treasury stock. 

Foreign Currency Translation 

The Company revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each month using applicable exchange rates. 

Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in other comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to the re-measurement of transactions to the functional currency are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 

Going Concern 

In connection with preparing financial statements for each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, exist that would raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. If substantial doubt exists, specific disclosures are required to be included in the Company's financial statements issued. Through its evaluation, the Company did not identify any conditions or events that would raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. 

Accounting Pronouncements Newly Adopted 

Debt 

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, &#8220;Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity&#8217;s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity&#8217;s Own Equity,&#8221; which includes provisions for reducing the number of accounting models used in accounting for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock, amending derivatives and earnings-per-share (EPS) guidance and expanding disclosures for convertible debt instruments and EPS. The Company adopted ASU No. 2020-06 as of January 1, 2022. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

Issuer&#8217;s Accounting for Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options 

In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-04, &#8220;Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt&#8212;Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation&#8212;Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging&#8212;Contracts in Entity&#8217;s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Issuer&#8217;s Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options,&#8221; which requires an issuer to account for any modification or exchange of the terms or conditions of a freestanding written call option classified as equity, such as warrants, that remains classified as equity as an exchange of the original instrument for a new instrument and provides a framework for measuring and recognizing the effect of the exchange as an adjustment to either equity or expense. The Company adopted ASU No. 2021-04 as of January 1, 2022 under a prospective approach. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

##TABLE_START 107 

##TABLE_END

Leases - Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments 

In July 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-05, &#8220;Leases (Topic 842), Lessors &#8211; Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments&#8221; which amends lessor lease classification requirements to allow leases with variable lease payments that are not dependent on a reference index or rate to be classified and accounted for as an operating lease, provided the lease would have been classified as a sales-type or direct financing lease and the lessor would have otherwise recognized a day-one loss. The Company adopted ASU No. 2021-05 as of January 1, 2022. As the Company has adopted ASC Topic 842, this guidance was applied retrospectively to leases that commenced or were modified after the adoption of ASC Topic 842 and prospectively to leases that commence or are modified after January 1, 2022. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

Disclosure of Government Assistance Received 

In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, &#8220;Government Assistance (Topic 832), Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance,&#8221; which improves transparency in financial reporting by requiring business entities to disclose information about certain types of government assistance received, specifically transactions with a government, which are accounted for by analogizing to a grant or contribution model. The Company adopted ASU No. 2021-10 as of January 1, 2022. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

Reference Rate Reform 

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, &#8220;Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,&#8221; which provides temporary optional relief for contracts modified as a result of reference rate reform meeting certain modification criteria, generally allowing an entity to account for contract modifications occurring due to reference rate reform as an event that does not require contract remeasurement or reassessment of a previous accounting determination at the modification date. The guidance also includes temporary optional expedients intended to provide relief from various hedge effectiveness requirements for hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform, provided certain criteria are met, and allows a one-time election to sell or transfer to either available-for-sale or trading any held-to-maturity (&#8220;HTM&#8221;) debt securities that refer to an interest rate affected by reference rate reform and were classified as HTM prior to January 1, 2020. Additionally, in January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, &#8220;Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope,&#8221; which provided additional clarification that certain optional expedients and exceptions noted above apply to derivative instruments that use an interest rate for margining, discounting or contract price alignment that is modified as a result of reference rate reform. This guidance was effective upon issuance and was able to be applied prospectively, with certain exceptions, through December 31, 2022. 

In November 2020, federal and state banking regulators issued the &#8220;Interagency Policy Statement on Reference Rates for Loans" to reiterate that a specific replacement rate for loans impacted by reference rate reform has not been endorsed and entities may utilize any replacement reference rate determined to be appropriate based on its funding model and customer needs. As discussed in the &#8220;Interagency Policy Statement on Reference Rates for Loans,&#8221; fallback language should be included in lending contracts to provide for use of a robust fallback rate if the initial reference rate is discontinued. Additionally, federal banking regulators issued the &#8220;Interagency Statement on LIBOR Transition&#8221; acknowledging that the administrator of LIBOR has announced it will consult on its intention to cease the publication of the one week and two month USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023. As discussed in the &#8220;Interagency Statement on LIBOR Transition,&#8221; regulators encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021, in order to facilitate an orderly, safe and sound LIBOR transition. The Company has discontinued use of USD LIBOR in new contracts and continues to monitor efforts and evaluate the impact of reference rate reform on its consolidated financial statements. 

In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06 &#8220;Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) - Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848,&#8221; which updated the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, after which entities would no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848. The objective of Topic 848 is to provide relief during the temporary transition period, thus, the FASB included a sunset provision within Topic 848 based on expectations of when LIBOR would cease being published. This guidance was effective upon issuance and can be applied prospectively, with certain exceptions, through December 31, 2024.

(2) Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

Business Combinations 

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, &#8220;Business Combinations (Topic 805), Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Customers with Contracts,&#8221; which clarifies diversity in practice related to recognition and measurement of contract assets and liabilities related to revenue contracts with customers which are acquired in a business combination by aligning business combination accounting with the subsequent accounting for contract assets and liabilities by requiring entities to apply ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, in order to recognize and measure deferred revenue in a business combination. The guidance also creates an exception to the general recognition and measurement principle in ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, under which such amounts are recognized by the acquirer at fair value on the acquisition date by providing two practical expedients for acquirers. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods therein, and is to be applied either prospectively or retrospectively depending on the date of initial application. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

Fair Value Hedging - Portfolio Layer Method 

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-01, &#8220;Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging - Portfolio Layer Method&#8221; which expands the current last-of-layer method by allowing multiple hedged layers to be designated for a single closed portfolio of financial assets or one or more beneficial interests secured by a portfolio of financial instruments. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods therein, and is to be applied under a prospective approach. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures 

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-02, &#8220;Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures&#8221; which eliminates the separate recognition and measurement guidance for TDRs by creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, and requiring entities to disclose current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for certain financing receivables and net investments in leases. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods therein. The amendments related to disclosures for loan modifications and the vintage disclosures should be applied under a prospective approach, while the guidance on TDRs should be applied using either a prospective or modified retrospective approach. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

Fair Value Measurement - Equity Securities with Contractual Sale Restrictions 

In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, &#8220;Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions&#8221; which clarifies the guidance in ASC 820 when measuring the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security, and also requires specific disclosures related to these types of securities. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods therein, and is to be applied under a prospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

Legislation Issued Related to Stock Repurchases 

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the &#8220;IRA&#8221;) was signed by the President of the United States. Among other things, the IRA imposes a new 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased after December 31, 2022. With certain exceptions, the value of stock repurchased is determined net of stock issued in the year, including shares issued pursuant to compensatory arrangements. These provisions are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

The Company monitors its equity investments without readily determinable fair values to identify potential transactions that may indicate an observable price change in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, requiring adjustment to its carrying amount. The Company recorded no upward and no downward adjustments related to such observable price changes in 2022 or 2021. The Company conducts a quarterly assessment of its equity securities without readily determinable fair values to determine whether impairment exists in such equity securities, considering, among other factors, the nature of the securities, financial condition of the issuer and expected future cash flows. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $ 12.2 million and $ 2.4 million, respectively, of impairment of equity securities without readily determinable fair values.

The Company conducts a regular assessment of its investment securities to determine whether securities are experiencing credit losses. Factors for consideration include the nature of the securities, credit ratings or financial condition of the issuer, the extent of the unrealized loss, expected cash flows, market conditions and the Company&#8217;s ability to hold the securities through the anticipated recovery period. 

The Company does not consider available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses at December 31, 2022 to be experiencing credit losses and recognized no resulting allowance for credit losses for such individually assessed credit losses. The Company does not intend to sell these investments and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these investments before recovery of the amortized cost bases, which may be the maturity dates of the securities. The unrealized losses within each category have occurred as a result of changes in interest rates, market spreads and market conditions subsequent to purchase. Available-for-sale securities with continuous unrealized losses existing for more than twelve months at December 31, 2022 were primarily mortgage-backed securities with unrealized losses due to increased market rates during such period. 

See Note (5) &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221; for further discussion regarding any credit losses associated with held-to-maturity securities at December 31, 2022.

The Company&#8217;s loan portfolio is generally comprised of loans to consumers and small to medium-sized businesses, which, for the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios, are located primarily within the geographic market areas that the banks serve. Various niche lending businesses, including lease finance and franchise lending, operate on a national level. The premium finance receivables portfolios are made to customers throughout the United States and Canada. The Company strives to maintain a loan portfolio that is diverse in terms of loan type, industry, borrower and geographic concentrations. Such diversification reduces the exposure to economic downturns that may occur in different segments of the economy or in different industries. 

Certain premium finance receivables are recorded net of unearned income. The unearned income portions of such premium finance receivables were $ 224.5 million and $ 135.5 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

Total loans, excluding PCD loans, include net deferred loan fees and costs and fair value purchase accounting adjustments totaling $ 71.8 million at December 31, 2022 and $ 50.8 million at December 31, 2021. 

Certain real estate loans, including mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial, consumer, and home equity loans with balances totaling approximately $ 8.2 billion and $ 8.0 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were pledged as collateral to secure the availability of borrowings from certain federal agency banks. At December 31, 2022, approximately $ 7.8 billion of these pledged loans are included in a blanket pledge of qualifying loans to the FHLB. The remaining $ 409.1 million of pledged loans was used to secure potential borrowings at the FRB discount window. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the banks had outstanding borrowings of $ 2.3 billion and $ 1.2 billion, respectively, from the FHLB in connection with these collateral arrangements. See Note (11) &#8220;Federal Home Loan Bank Advances&#8221; for a summary of these borrowings. 

It is the policy of the Company to review each prospective credit in order to determine the appropriateness and, when required, the adequacy of security or collateral necessary to obtain when making a loan. The type of collateral, when required, will vary from liquid assets to real estate. The Company seeks to assure access to collateral, in the event of default, through adherence to state lending laws and the Company&#8217;s credit monitoring procedures. 

(5) Allowance for Credit Losses 

In accordance with ASC 326, the Company is required to measure the allowance for credit losses of financial assets with similar risk characteristics on a collective or pooled basis. In considering the segmentation of financial assets measured at amortized 

##TABLE_START 114 

##TABLE_END

cost into pools, the Company considered various risk characteristics in its analysis. Generally, the segmentation utilized represents the level at which the Company develops and documents its systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses for the financial asset held at amortized cost, specifically the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio and debt securities classified as held-to-maturity. Below is a summary of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio segments and major debt security types: 

Commercial loans: The Company makes commercial loans for many purposes, including working capital lines and leasing arrangements, that are generally renewable annually and supported by business assets, personal guarantees and additional collateral. Underlying collateral includes receivables, inventory, enterprise value and the assets of the business. Commercial business lending is generally considered to involve a slightly higher degree of risk than traditional consumer bank lending. This portfolio includes a range of industries, including manufacturing, restaurants, franchise, professional services, equipment finance and leasing, mortgage warehouse lending and industrial. Individually assessed collateral dependent commercial loans are primarily collateralized by equipment and the enterprise value or assets of the specific business. 

Commercial real estate loans, including construction and development, and non-construction: The Company&#8217;s commercial real estate loans are generally secured by a first mortgage lien and assignment of rents on the underlying property (utilized in related assessment of individually assessed collateral dependent loans). Since most of the Company&#8217;s bank branches are located in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin, a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s commercial real estate loan portfolio is located in this region. As the risks and circumstances of such loans in construction phase vary from that of non-construction commercial real estate loans, the Company assesses the allowance for credit losses separately for these two segments. 

Home equity loans: The Company&#8217;s home equity loans and lines of credit are primarily originated by each of the bank subsidiaries in their local markets where there is a strong understanding of the underlying real estate value. The Company&#8217;s banks monitor and manage these loans, and conduct an automated review of all home equity lines of credit at least twice per year. This review collects FICO and Bankruptcy scores for each home equity borrower and identifies situations where the credit strength of the borrower is declining. When other specific events occur that may influence repayment, information such as tax liens or judgments is collected. The bank subsidiaries use this information to manage loans that may be higher risk and to determine whether to obtain additional credit information or updated property valuations. In a limited number of cases, the Company may issue home equity credit together with first mortgage financing, and requests for such financing are evaluated on a combined basis. 

Residential real estate loans, including early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies: The Company&#8217;s residential real estate portfolio includes one- to four-family adjustable rate mortgages, construction loans to individuals and bridge financing loans for qualifying customers as well as certain long-term fixed rate loans. The Company&#8217;s residential mortgages relate to properties located principally in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin or vacation homes owned by local residents. Due to interest rate risk considerations, the Company generally sells in the secondary market loans originated with long-term fixed rates, for which we receive fee income. The Company also selectively retains certain of these loans within the banks&#8217; own loan portfolios where they are non-agency conforming, or where the terms of the loans make them favorable to retain. Since this loan portfolio consists primarily of locally originated loans, and since the majority of the borrowers are longer-term customers with lower LTV ratios, the Company may face a relatively low risk of borrower default and delinquency. Collateral dependent residential real estate loans that are individually assessed when measuring the allowance for credit losses are primarily collateralized by such one-to-four family properties noted above. It is not the Company&#8217;s current practice to underwrite, and there are no plans to underwrite subprime, Alt A, no or little documentation loans, or option ARM loans. 

Additionally, early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies include loans in which the Company is eligible or has exercised its option under the Government National Mortgage Association (&#8220;GNMA&#8221;) securitization program to repurchase certain delinquent mortgage loans. Such loans were previously transferred by the Company with servicing of such loans retained. Early buy-out loans are insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (&#8220;FHA&#8221;) or the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, subject to indemnifications and insurance limits for certain loans. 

Premium finance receivables: The Company makes loans to businesses to finance the insurance premiums they pay on their property and casualty insurance policies. The loans are indirectly originated by working through independent medium and large insurance agents and brokers located throughout the United States and Canada. The insurance premiums financed are primarily for commercial customers&#8217; purchases of liability, property and casualty and other commercial insurance. This lending involves relatively rapid turnover of the loan portfolio and high volume of loan originations. The Company performs ongoing credit and other reviews of the agents and brokers, and performs various internal audit steps to mitigate against the risk of any fraud. 

##TABLE_START 115 

##TABLE_END

The Company also originates life insurance premium finance receivables. These loans are originated directly with the borrowers with assistance from life insurance carriers, independent insurance agents, financial advisors and legal counsel. The life insurance policy is the primary form of collateral. In addition, these loans often are secured with a letter of credit, marketable securities or certificates of deposit. In some cases, the Company may make a loan that has a partially unsecured position. 

Consumer and other loans: Included in the consumer and other loan category is a wide variety of personal and consumer loans to individuals. The Company originates consumer loans in order to provide a wider range of financial services to its customers. Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than mortgage loans but generally involve more credit risk than mortgage loans due to the type and nature of the collateral. 

U.S. government agency securities: This security type includes debt obligations of certain government-sponsored entities of the U.S. government such as the Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation and Fannie Mae. Such securities often contain an explicit or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government. 

Municipal securities: The Company&#8217;s municipal securities portfolio includes bond issues for various municipal government entities located throughout the United States, including the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin, some of which are privately placed and non-rated. Though the risk of loss is typically low, default history exists on municipal securities within the United States. 

Mortgage-backed securities : This security type includes debt obligations supported by pools of individual mortgage loans and issued by certain government-sponsored entities of the U.S. government such as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Such securities are considered to contain an implicit guarantee of the U.S. government. 

Corporate notes : The Company&#8217;s corporate notes portfolio includes bond issues for various public companies representing a diversified population of industries. The risk of loss in this portfolio is considered low based on the characteristics of the investments. 

In accordance with ASC 326, the Company elected to not measure an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest. As such, accrued interest is written off in a timely manner when deemed uncollectible. Any such write-off of accrued interest will reverse previously recognized interest income. In addition, the Company elected to not include accrued interest within presentation and disclosures of the carrying amount of financial assets held at amortized cost. This election is applicable to the various disclosures included within the Company&#8217;s financial statements. Accrued interest related to financial assets held at amortized cost is included within accrued interest receivable and other assets within the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition and totaled $ 214.0 million at December 31, 2022 and $ 117.4 million at December 31, 2021.

Credit Quality Indicators 

Credit quality indicators, specifically the Company&#8217;s internal risk rating systems, reflect how the Company monitors credit losses and represents factors used by the Company when measuring the allowance for credit losses. The following discusses the Company&#8217;s credit quality indicators by financial asset.

Loan portfolios 

The Company&#8217;s ability to manage credit risk depends in large part on its ability to properly identify and manage problem loans. To do so, the Company operates a credit risk rating system under which credit management personnel assign a credit risk rating (1 to 10 rating, with higher scores indicating higher risk) to each loan at the time of origination and review loans on a regular basis. For loans measured at amortized cost, these credit risk ratings are also an important aspect of the Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses measurement methodology. The credit risk rating structure and classifications are shown below: 

Pass (risk rating 1 to 5): Based on various factors (liquidity, leverage, etc.), the Company believes asset quality is acceptable and is deemed to not require additional monitoring by the Company. 

Special mention (risk rating 6): Assets in this category are currently protected, potentially weak, but not to the point of substandard classification. Loss potential is moderate if corrective action is not taken. 

Substandard accrual (risk rating 7): Assets in this category have well defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Loss potential is distinct but with no discernible impairment. 

Substandard nonaccrual/doubtful (risk rating 8 and 9): Assets have all the weaknesses in those classified &#8220;substandard accrual&#8221; with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current existing facts, conditions, and values, improbable. 

Loss/fully charged-off (risk rating 10): Assets in this category are considered fully uncollectible. As such, these assets have no carrying balance on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Condition. 

Early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies : These loans are measured at fair value and thus excluded from the measurement of the allowance for credit losses. Credit risk rating assigned to such loans are considered in the measurement of fair value as well as related guarantees provided by the FHA or the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, subject to indemnifications and insurance limits for certain loans. 

Generally, each loan officer is responsible for monitoring his or her loan portfolio, recommending a credit risk rating for each loan in his or her portfolio and ensuring the credit risk ratings are appropriate. These credit risk ratings are then ratified by the bank&#8217;s chief credit officer and/or concurrence credit officer. Credit risk ratings are determined by evaluating a number of factors including: a borrower&#8217;s financial strength, cash flow coverage, collateral protection and guarantees. 

The Company&#8217;s Problem Loan Reporting system includes all such loans described above with credit risk ratings of 6 through 9. This system is designed to provide an on-going detailed tracking mechanism for each problem loan. Once management determines that a loan has deteriorated to a point where it has a credit risk rating of 6 or worse, the Company&#8217;s Managed Asset Division performs an overall credit and collateral review. As part of this review, all underlying collateral is identified and the valuation methodology is analyzed and tracked. As a result of this initial review by the Company&#8217;s Managed Asset Division, the credit risk rating is reviewed and a portion of the outstanding loan balance may be deemed uncollectible and, as a result, no longer share similar risk characteristics as its related pool. If that is the case, the individual loan is considered collateral dependent and individually assessed for an allowance for credit loss. The Company&#8217;s individual assessment utilizes an independent re-appraisal of the collateral (unless such a third-party evaluation is not possible due to the unique nature of the collateral, such as a closely-held business or thinly traded securities). In the case of commercial real estate collateral, an independent third party appraisal is ordered by the Company&#8217;s Real Estate Services Group to determine if there has been any change in the underlying collateral value. These independent appraisals are reviewed by the Real Estate Services Group and sometimes by independent third party valuation experts and may be adjusted depending upon market conditions. 

Through the credit risk rating process, such loans are reviewed to determine if they are performing in accordance with the original contractual terms. If the borrower has failed to comply with the original contractual terms, further action may be required by the Company, including a downgrade in the credit risk rating, movement to non-accrual status or a charge-off. If the Company determines that a loan amount or portion thereof is uncollectible, the loan&#8217;s credit risk rating is immediately downgraded to an 8 or 9 and the uncollectible amount is charged-off. Any loan that has a partial charge-off continues to be assigned a credit risk rating of an 8 or 9 for the duration of time that a balance remains outstanding. The Company undertakes a thorough and ongoing analysis to determine if additional impairment and/or charge-offs are appropriate and to begin a workout plan for the credit to minimize actual losses. In determining the appropriate charge-off for collateral-dependent loans, the Company considers the results of appraisals for the associated collateral.

Held-to-maturity debt securities 

The Company conducts an assessment of its investment securities, including those classified as held-to-maturity, at the time of purchase and on at least an annual basis to ensure such investment securities remain within appropriate levels of risk and continue to perform satisfactorily in fulfilling its obligations. The Company considers, among other factors, the nature of the securities and credit ratings or financial condition of the issuer. If available, the Company obtains a credit rating for issuers from a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (&#8220;NRSRO&#8221;) for consideration. If no such rating is available for an issuer, the Company performs an internal rating based on the scale utilized within the loan portfolio as discussed above. For purposes of the table below, the Company has converted any issuer rating from an NRSRO into the Company&#8217;s internal ratings based on Investment Policy and review by the Company&#8217;s management.

Measurement of Allowance for Credit Losses 

The Company&#8217;s allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan losses, the allowance for unfunded commitment losses and the allowance for held-to-maturity debt security losses. In accordance with ASC 326, the Company measures the allowance for credit losses at the time of origination or purchase of a financial asset, representing an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses on the related asset. When developing its estimate, the Company considers available information relevant to assessing the collectability of cash flows, from both internal and external sources. Historical credit loss experience is one input in the estimation process as well as inputs relevant to current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. In considering past events, the Company considers the relevance, or lack thereof, of historical information due to changes in such things as financial asset underwriting or collection practices, and changes in portfolio mix due to changing business plans and strategies. In considering current conditions and forecasts, the Company considers both the current economic environment and the forecasted direction of the economic environment with emphasis on those factors deemed relevant to or driving changes in expected credit losses. As significant judgment is required, the review of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is performed quarterly by various committees with participation by the Company&#8217;s executive management.

The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective or pooled basis when similar risk characteristics exist, based upon the segmentation discussed above. The Company utilizes modeling methodologies that estimate lifetime credit loss rates on each pool, including methodologies estimating the probability of default and loss given default on specific segments. Historical credit loss history is adjusted for reasonable and supportable forecasts developed by the Company on a quantitative or qualitative basis and incorporates third party economic forecasts. Reasonable and supportable forecasts consider the macroeconomic factors that are most relevant to evaluating and predicting expected credit losses in the Company&#8217;s financial assets. Currently, the Company utilizes an eight quarter forecast period using Moody&#8217;s baseline scenario from November 2022, which is reviewed within the Company&#8217;s governance structure. For periods beyond the ability to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts, the Company reverts to historical loss rates at an input level, straight-line over a four quarter reversion period. Expected credit losses are measured over the contractual term of the financial asset with consideration of expected prepayments. Expected extensions, renewals or modifications of the financial asset are only considered when either (1) the expected extension, renewal or modification is contained within the existing agreement and is not unconditionally cancelable, or (2) the expected extension, renewal or modification is reasonably expected to result in a TDR. The methodologies discussed above are applied to both current asset balances on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition and off-balance sheet commitments (i.e. unfunded lending-related commitments). 

Assets that do not share similar risk characteristics with a pool are assessed for the allowance for credit losses on an individual basis. These typically include assets experiencing financial difficulties, including assets rated as substandard nonaccrual and doubtful as well as assets currently classified or expected to be classified as TDRs. If foreclosure is probable or the asset is considered collateral-dependent, expected credit losses are measured based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral adjusted for selling costs, if appropriate. Underlying collateral across the Company&#8217;s segments consist primarily of real estate, land and construction assets as well as general business assets of the borrower. As of December 31, 2022, excluding loans carried at fair value, substandard nonaccrual and doubtful loans totaling $ 21.1 million in carrying balance had no related allowance for credit losses. For certain accruing current and expected TDRs, expected credit losses are measured based upon the present value of future cash flows of the modified asset terms compared to the amortized cost of the asset. As of December 31, 2022, there were no loans identified as being reasonably expected to be modified into TDRs in the future. 

The Company does not measure an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable balances because these balances are written off in a timely manner as a reduction to interest income when assets are placed on nonaccrual status.

(1) The initial allowance for credit losses on PCD loans acquired during 2021 measured approximately $ 2.8 million, of which $ 2.3 million was charged off related to PCD loans that met the Company&#8217;s charge-off policy at the time of acquisition. After considering these loans that were immediately charged off, the net impact of PCD allowance for credit losses at the acquisition date was approximately $ 470,000 . 

For the year ending December 31, 2022, the Company recognized an approximately $ 78.2 million provision for credit losses related to loans and lending agreements, including an approximately $ 40.4 million provision for credit losses related to the commercial real estate portfolio. The increased provision was primarily the result of changes in the macroeconomic forecast, specifically the Company&#8217;s macroeconomic forecasts of key model inputs (most notably, Commercial Real Estate Price Index primarily impacting the commercial real estate portfolio and Baa corporate credit spreads) as well as growth experienced by the Company in 2022 in various loan portfolios. While uncertainties remain regarding expected economic performance, macroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2022 assume that the impact of those uncertainties is more severe compared to that assumed at December 31, 2021. Other key drivers of provision for credit losses in these portfolios include, but are not limited to, positive loan risk rating migration and net charge-offs in 2022 totaled $ 20.3 million.

Held-to-maturity debt securities 

The allowance for credit losses on the Company&#8217;s held-to-maturity debt securities is presented as a reduction to the amortized cost basis of held-to-maturity securities on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company recognized approximately $ 410,000 and $ 17,000 , respectively, of provision for credit losses related to held-to-maturity securities. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company did not identify any losses within its portfolio that would be deemed a credit loss and require additional measurement of an allowance for credit losses. 

TDRs 

At December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 41.1 million in loans modified in TDRs. The $ 41.1 million in TDRs represents 191 credits in which economic concessions were granted to certain borrowers to better align the terms of their loans with their current ability to pay. 

The Company&#8217;s approach to restructuring loans is built on its credit risk rating system, which requires credit management personnel to assign a credit risk rating to each loan. In each case, the loan officer is responsible for recommending a credit risk rating for each loan and ensuring the credit risk ratings are appropriate. These credit risk ratings are then reviewed and approved by the bank&#8217;s chief credit officer and/or concurrence credit officer. Credit risk ratings are determined by evaluating a number of factors including a borrower&#8217;s financial strength, cash flow coverage, collateral protection and guarantees. The Company&#8217;s credit risk rating scale is one through ten with higher scores indicating higher risk. In the case of loans rated six or worse following modification, the Company&#8217;s Managed Assets Division evaluates the loan and the credit risk rating and determines that the loan has been restructured to be reasonably assured of repayment and of performance according to the modified terms and is supported by a current, well-documented credit assessment of the borrower&#8217;s financial condition and prospects for repayment under the revised terms. 

A modification of a loan with an existing credit risk rating of 6 or worse or a modification of any other credit, which will result in a restructured credit risk rating of 6 or worse must be reviewed for possible TDR classification. In that event, the Company&#8217;s Managed Assets Division conducts an overall credit and collateral review. A modification of a loan is considered to be a TDR if both (1) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and (2) for economic or legal reasons, the bank grants a concession to a borrower that it would not otherwise consider. The modification of a loan where the credit risk rating is 5 or better after such modification is not considered to be a TDR. Based on the Company&#8217;s credit risk rating system, it considers that borrowers whose credit risk rating is 5 or better are not experiencing financial difficulties and therefore, are not considered TDRs. 

All credits determined to be a TDR will continue to be classified as a TDR in all subsequent periods, unless the borrower has been in compliance with the loan&#8217;s modified terms for a period of six months (including over a calendar year-end) and the current interest rate represents a market rate at the time of restructuring. The Managed Assets Division, in consultation with the respective loan officer, determines whether the modified interest rate represented a current market rate at the time of restructuring. Using knowledge of current market conditions and rates, competitive pricing on recent loan originations, and an assessment of various characteristics of the modified loan (including collateral position and payment history), an appropriate market rate for a new borrower with similar risk is determined. If the modified interest rate meets or exceeds this market rate for a new borrower with similar risk, the modified interest rate represents a market rate at the time of restructuring. Additionally, before removing a loan from TDR classification, a review of the current or previously measured impairment on the loan and any concerns related to future performance by the borrower is conducted. If concerns exist about the future ability of the borrower to meet its obligations under the loans based on a credit review by the Managed Assets Division, the TDR classification is not removed from the loan. 

TDRs are individually assessed at the time of modification and on a quarterly basis to measure an allowance for credit loss. The carrying amount of the loan is compared to the expected payments to be received, discounted at the loan&#8217;s original rate, or for collateral dependent loans, to the fair value of the collateral. Any shortfall is recorded as a reserve. Each TDR was individually assessed at December 31, 2022 and approximately $ 871,000 of allowance for credit losses was measured through the Company&#8217;s normal reserving methodology. 

TDRs may arise in which, due to financial difficulties experienced by the borrower, the Company obtains through physical possession one or more collateral assets in satisfaction of all or part of an existing credit. Once possession is obtained, the Company reclassifies the appropriate portion of the remaining balance of the credit from loans to OREO, which is included within other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. For any residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, the Company is considered to possess the related collateral only if legal title is obtained upon completion of foreclosure, or the borrower conveys all interest in the residential real estate property to the Company through

##TABLE_END

completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or similar legal agreement. At December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 1.6 million of foreclosed residential real estate properties included within OREO. Further, the recorded investment in residential mortgage loans secured by residential real estate properties for which foreclosure proceedings are in process totaled $ 59.5 million and $ 9.6 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

The tables below present a summary of the post-modification balance of loans restructured during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 which represent TDRs:

(6) Mortgage Servicing Rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;) 

Following is a summary of the changes in the carrying value of MSRs, accounted for at fair value, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: 

##TABLE_START December 31, December 31, December 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Fair value at beginning of year $ 147,571 &#160; $ 92,081 &#160; $ 85,638 &#160; Additions from loans sold with servicing retained 46,221 &#160; 72,754 &#160; 71,077 &#160; Estimate of changes in fair value due to: Early buyout options (&#8220;EBO&#8221;) exercised ( 176 ) ( 749 ) ( 1,291 ) Payoffs and paydowns ( 23,455 ) ( 34,788 ) ( 32,579 ) Changes in valuation inputs or assumptions 60,064 &#160; 18,273 &#160; ( 30,764 ) Fair value at end of year $ 230,225 &#160; $ 147,571 &#160; $ 92,081 &#160; Unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans serviced for others $ 14,052,596 &#160; $ 13,126,254 &#160; $ 10,833,135 &#160; ##TABLE_END

The Company recognizes MSR assets upon the sale of residential real estate loans to external third parties when it retains the obligation to service the loans and the servicing fee is more than adequate compensation. The initial recognition of MSR assets from loans sold with servicing retained and subsequent changes in fair value of all MSRs are recognized in mortgage banking revenue. MSRs are subject to changes in value from actual and expected prepayment of the underlying loans. 

The estimation of fair value related to MSRs is partly impacted by the Company exercising its EBO on eligible loans previously sold to the Government National Mortgage Association (&#8220;GNMA&#8221;). Under such optional repurchase program, financial institutions acting as servicers are allowed to buy back from the securitized loan pool individual delinquent mortgage loans meeting certain criteria for which the institution was the original transferor of such loans. At the option of the servicer and without prior authorization from GNMA, the servicer may repurchase such delinquent loans for an amount equal to the remaining principal balance of the loan. At the time of such repurchase, any MSR value related to such loans is derecognized. 

The MSR asset fair value is determined by using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the objective characteristics of the portfolio as well as subjective valuation parameters that purchasers of servicing would apply to such portfolios sold into the secondary market. The subjective factors include loan prepayment speeds, discount rates, servicing costs and other economic factors. The Company uses a third party to assist in the valuation of MSRs. 

Periodically the Company will purchase options for the right to purchase securities not currently held within the banks&#8217; investment portfolios or enter into interest rate swaps in which the Company elects to not designate such derivatives as hedging instruments. These option and swap transactions are designed primarily to economically hedge a portion of the fair value adjustments related to the Company&#8217;s MSRs. The gain or loss associated with these derivative contracts is included in mortgage banking revenue. For more information regarding these hedges outstanding as of December 31, 2022, see Note (21) &#8220;Derivative Financial Instruments&#8221; in Item 8 of this report. There were no such options or swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2021.

(7) Business Combinations 

On November 15, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition of certain assets from The Allstate Corporation (&#8220;Allstate&#8221;). Through this business combination, the Company acquired approximately $ 581.6 million of loans, net of allowance for credit losses measured on the acquisition date. The loan portfolio was comprised of approximately 1,800 loans to Allstate agents nationally. In addition to acquiring the loans, the Company became the national preferred provider of loans to Allstate agents. In connection with the loan acquisition, a team of Allstate agency lending specialists joined the Company to augment and expand Wintrust&#8217;s existing insurance agency finance business. As the transaction was determined to be a business combination, the Company recorded goodwill of approximately $ 9.3 million on the purchase. 

(8) Goodwill and Other Acquisition-Related Intangible Assets 

A summary of the Company&#8217;s goodwill assets by business segment is presented in the following table:

The specialty finance segment&#8217;s goodwill decreased $ 1.6 million in 2022 as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments related to prior Canadian acquisitions. 

The Company assesses each reporting unit&#8217;s goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis and considers potential indicators of impairment at each reporting date between annual goodwill impairment tests. At October 1, 2022, the Company utilized a qualitative approach for its annual goodwill impairment tests of the banking, specialty finance and wealth management reporting units and determined that no impairment existed at that time. 

At each reporting date between annual goodwill impairment tests, the Company considers potential indicators of impairment. The Company assessed whether events and circumstances as of each reporting date in 2022 resulted in it being more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying value. Potential impairment indicators considered include the condition of the economy and banking industry; government intervention and regulatory updates; the impact of recent events to financial performance and cost factors of the reporting units; performance of the Company&#8217;s stock and other relevant events. As of December 31, 2022, the Company identified no indicators of goodwill impairment subsequent to its analysis as of October 1, 2022 within the community banking, specialty finance or wealth management reporting units and the Company determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of all reporting units exceeded the respective carrying value of such reporting unit.

Notes Payable 

On September 18, 2018, the Company entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) with certain unaffiliated banks. The Credit Agreement consisted of a $ 150.0 million term loan facility and a $ 100.0 million revolving credit facility. On December 12, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment and restatement of the Credit Agreement pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of December 12, 2022, among the Company and the unaffiliated banks named therein as lenders and agents (the &#8220;Amended and Restated Credit Agreement&#8221;). In connection with the entry into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the outstanding term loan under the existing Credit Agreement was paid in full pursuant to the terms thereof. 

The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for, among other things, an increase to the term loan facility to $ 200.0 million, an extension of the maturity date for the revolving credit facility to December 11, 2023, and an extension of the maturity date for the term loan facility to December 12, 2027. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also provides for certain administrative changes and the modification of certain financial covenants that must be met by the Company for so long as any amounts or commitments under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are still outstanding. 

Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that are considered &#8220;Base Rate Loans&#8221; bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of (1) 75 basis points plus (2) the highest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, and (c) Term SOFR for a one-month tenor in effect on such day plus 110 basis points. Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that are considered &#8220;Term SOFR Loans&#8221; bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of (1) 160 basis points plus (2) Term SOFR for the applicable interested period. A commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears in an amount equal to 0.30 % of the actual daily amount by which the lenders&#8217; commitments under the revolving credit facility exceeded the amount outstanding under such facility. The Company is required to make monthly or quarterly (as applicable) payments of interest in respect of all loans under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and quarterly payments of principal in respect of the loans under the term loan facility. 

Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are secured by pledges of and first priority perfected security interests in the Company&#8217;s equity interest in its bank subsidiaries and contain several restrictive covenants, including the maintenance of various capital adequacy levels, asset quality and profitability ratios, and certain restrictions on dividends and other indebtedness. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The term loan facility and revolving credit facility under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are available to be utilized, as needed, to provide capital to fund continued growth at the Company&#8217;s banks and to serve as an interim source of funds for acquisitions, common stock repurchases or other general corporate purposes. 

The term debt facility is stated at par of the current outstanding balance of the debt adjusted for unamortized costs paid by the Company in relation to the debt issuance. Unamortized costs paid by the Company in relation to the issuance of the revolving credit facility are classified in other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. 

As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding principal balance under the term loan facility was $ 199.8 million and there was no outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit facility.

Short-term Borrowings 

Short-term borrowings include securities sold under repurchase agreements of customer sweep accounts in connection with master repurchase agreements at the banks. These borrowings totaled $ 17.6 million and $ 9.2 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company records securities sold under repurchase agreements at their gross value and does not offset positions on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had pledged securities related to its customer balances in sweep accounts of $ 173.0 million. Securities pledged for customer balances in sweep accounts and short-term borrowings from brokers are maintained under the Company&#8217;s control and consist of mortgage-backed securities. These securities are included in the available-for-sale portfolio as reflected on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition. 

The following is a summary of these securities pledged as of December 31, 2022 disaggregated by investment category and maturity of the related customer sweep account, and reconciled to the outstanding balance of securities sold under repurchase agreements:

Other Borrowings 

Other borrowings represent a fixed-rate promissory note (&#8220;Fixed-Rate Promissory Note&#8221;) issued by the Company in June 2017. Amendments to the Fixed-Rate Promissory Note since issuance increased the principal amount to $ 66.4 million, reduced the interest rate to 1.70 % and extended the maturity date to March 31, 2025. The Fixed-Rate Promissory Note relates to and is secured by three office buildings owned by the Company. At December 31, 2022, the Fixed-Rate Promissory Note had a balance of $ 61.3 million compared to $ 63.3 million at December 31, 2021. Under the Fixed-Rate Promissory Note, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company made monthly principal and interest payments. The Fixed-Rate Promissory Note contains several restrictive covenants, including the maintenance of various capital adequacy levels, asset quality and profitability ratios, and certain restrictions on dividends and indebtedness. At December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. 

Secured Borrowings 

Secured borrowings primarily represent transactions to sell an undivided co-ownership interest in all receivables owed to the Company&#8217;s subsidiary, First Insurance Funding of Canada (&#8220;FIFC Canada&#8221;). In December 2014, FIFC Canada sold such interest to an unrelated third party in exchange for a cash payment of approximately C$ 150 million pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement (&#8220;Receivables Purchase Agreement&#8221;). Amendments to the Receivables Purchase Agreement since issuance increased the total payments to C$ 420 million and extended the maturity date to December 15, 2023. These transactions were not considered sales of receivables and, as such, related proceeds received are reflected on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition as a secured borrowing owed to the unrelated third party, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, and translated to the Company&#8217;s reporting currency as of the respective date. At December 31, 2022, the translated balance of the secured borrowing totaled $ 309.7 million compared to $ 332.2 million at December 31, 2021. The interest rate under the Receivables Purchase Agreement is the Canadian Commercial Paper Rate plus 78 basis points. 

The remaining $ 8.2 million within secured borrowings at December 31, 2022 represents other sold interests in certain loans by the Company that were not considered sales and, as such, related proceeds received are reflected on the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Condition as a secured borrowing owed to the various unrelated third parties. 

(14) Junior Subordinated Debentures 

As of December 31, 2022, the Company owned 100 % of the common securities of eleven trusts, Wintrust Capital Trust III, Wintrust Statutory Trust IV, Wintrust Statutory Trust V, Wintrust Capital Trust VII, Wintrust Capital Trust VIII, Wintrust Capital Trust IX, Northview Capital Trust I, Town Bankshares Capital Trust I, First Northwest Capital Trust I, Suburban Illinois Capital Trust II, and Community Financial Shares Statutory Trust II (the &#8220;Trusts&#8221;) set up to provide long-term financing. The Northview, Town, First Northwest, Suburban and Community Financial Shares capital trusts were acquired as 

##TABLE_START 131 

##TABLE_END

part of the acquisitions of Northview Financial Corporation, Town Bankshares, Ltd., First Northwest Bancorp, Inc., Suburban Illinois Bancorp, Inc. and Community Financial Shares, Inc., respectively. The Trusts were formed for purposes of issuing trust preferred securities to third-party investors and investing the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities and common securities solely in junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company (or assumed by the Company in connection with an acquisition), with the same maturities and interest rates as the trust preferred securities. The junior subordinated debentures are the sole assets of the Trusts. In each Trust, the common securities represent approximately 3 % of the junior subordinated debentures and the trust preferred securities represent approximately 97 % of the junior subordinated debentures. 

The Trusts are reported in the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements as unconsolidated subsidiaries. Accordingly, in the Consolidated Statements of Condition, the junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company to the Trusts are reported as liabilities and the common securities of the Trusts, all of which are owned by the Company, are included in investment securities. 

The following table provides a summary of the Company&#8217;s junior subordinated debentures as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The junior subordinated debentures represent the par value of the obligations owed to the Trusts.

The interest rates on the variable rate junior subordinated debentures are based on the three-month LIBOR rate and reset on a quarterly basis. At December 31, 2022, the weighted average contractual interest rate on the junior subordinated debentures was 6.87 %. Prior to 2021, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of $ 210.0 million to hedge the variable cash flows on certain junior subordinated debentures. Such interest rate swaps matured in 2021 and no separate hedging derivatives were outstanding at December 31, 2022 related to the variable cash flows on any balance of the junior subordinated debentures. Distributions on the common and preferred securities issued by the Trusts are payable quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the interest rates being earned by the Trusts on the junior subordinated debentures. Interest expense on the junior subordinated debentures is deductible for income tax purposes. 

Under the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (&#8220;AIRLA&#8221;) and Part 253 of Regulation ZZ (Rule 253), after June 30, 2023, the interest rate on the junior subordinated debentures will, by operation of law, change their base rate from USD LIBOR to CME Term SOFR of the same tenor, plus an applicable tenor spread adjustment. CME Term SOFR is an indicative, forward-looking measurement of daily overnight SOFR. CME Term SOFR is published by CME Group Inc., as administrator of that rate. The calculation agent for any series of the junior subordinated debentures may also make additional administrative conforming changes to the terms of that series of the junior subordinated debentures under AIRLA and Rule 253. 

The Company has guaranteed the payment of distributions and payments upon liquidation or redemption of the trust preferred securities, in each case to the extent of funds held by the Trusts. The Company and the Trusts believe that, taken together, the obligations of the Company under the guarantees, the junior subordinated debentures, and other related agreements provide, in the aggregate, a full, irrevocable and unconditional guarantee, on a subordinated basis, of all of the obligations of the Trusts under the trust preferred securities. Subject to certain limitations, the Company has the right to defer the payment of interest on the junior subordinated debentures at any time, or from time to time, for a period not to exceed 20 consecutive quarters. The trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the junior subordinated debentures at maturity or their earlier redemption. The junior subordinated debentures are redeemable in whole or in part prior to maturity at any time after the earliest redemption dates shown in the table, and earlier at the discretion of the Company if 

##TABLE_START 132 

##TABLE_END

certain conditions are met, and, in any event, only after the Company has obtained Federal Reserve Bank (&#8220;FRB&#8221;) approval, if then required under applicable guidelines or regulations. 

At December 31, 2022, the Company included $ 245.5 million of the junior subordinated debentures, net of common securities, in Tier 2 regulatory capital.

Wealth Management Revenue 

Wealth management revenue is comprised of brokerage and insurance product commissions, managed money fees and trust and asset management revenue of the Company's four wealth management subsidiaries: Wintrust Investments, Great Lakes Advisors, CTC and CDEC. All wealth management revenue is recognized in the wealth management segment. 

Brokerage and insurance product commissions consists primarily of commissions earned from trade execution services on behalf of customers and from selling mutual funds, insurance and other investment products to customers. For trade execution services, the Company recognizes commissions and receives payment from the brokerage customers at the point of transaction execution. Commissions received from the investment or insurance product providers are recognized at the point of sale of the product. The Company also receives trail and other commissions from providers for certain plans. These are generally based on qualifying account values and are recognized once the performance obligation, specific to each provider, is satisfied on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. 

Trust revenue is earned primarily from trust and custody services that are generally performed over time as well as fees earned on funds held during the facilitation of tax-deferred like-kind exchange transactions. Revenue is determined periodically based on a schedule of fees applied to the value of each customer account using a time-elapsed method to measure progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. Fees are typically billed on a calendar month or quarter basis in advance or in arrears depending upon the contract. Upfront fees received related to the facilitation of tax-deferred like-kind exchange transactions are deferred until the transaction is completed. Additional fees earned for certain extraordinary services performed on behalf of the customers are recognized when the service has been performed. 

Asset management revenue is earned from money management and advisory services that are performed over time. Revenue is based primarily on the market value of assets under management or administration using a time-elapsed method to measure progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. Fees are typically billed on a calendar month or quarter basis in advance or in arrears depending upon the contract. Certain programs provide the customer with an option of paying fees as a percentage of the account value or incurring commission charges for each trade similar to brokerage and insurance product commissions. Trade commissions and any other fees received for additional services are recognized at a point in time once the performance obligation is satisfied.

Mortgage Broker Fees 

For customers desiring a mortgage product not currently offered by the Company, the Company may refer such customers and, with permission, direct such customers' applications to certain third party mortgage brokers. Mortgage broker fees are received from these brokers for such customer referrals upon settlement of the underlying mortgage. The Company's entitlement to the consideration is contingent on the settlement of the mortgage which is highly susceptible to factors outside of the Company's influence, such as the third party broker's underwriting requirements. Also, the uncertainty surrounding the consideration could be resolved in varying lengths of time, dependent upon the third party brokers. Therefore, mortgage broker fees are recognized at the settlement of the underlying mortgage when the consideration is received. Broker fees are recognized in the community banking segment. 

Service Charges on Deposit Accounts 

Service charges on deposit accounts include fees charged to deposit customers for various services, including account analysis services, and are based on factors such as the size and type of customer, type of product and number of transactions. The fees are based on a standard schedule of fees and, depending on the nature of the service performed, the service is performed at a point in time or over a period of a month. When the service is performed at a point in time, the Company recognizes and receives revenue when the service has been performed. When the service is performed over a period of a month, the Company recognizes and receives revenue in the month the service has been performed. Service charges on deposit accounts are recognized in the community banking segment. 

Administrative Services 

Administrative services revenue is earned from providing outsourced administrative services, such as data processing of payrolls, billing and cash management services, to temporary staffing service clients located throughout the United States. Fees are charged periodically (typically a payroll cycle) and computed in accordance with the contractually determined rate applied to the total gross billings administered for the period. The revenue is recognized over the period using a time-elapsed method to measure progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. Other fees are charged on a per occurrence basis as the service is provided in the billing cycle. The Company has certain contracts with customers to perform outsourced administrative services and short-term accounts receivable financing. For these contracts, the total fee is allocated between the administrative services revenue and interest income during the client onboarding process based on the specific client and services provided. Administrative services revenue is recognized in the specialty finance segment. 

Card and Deposit Related Fees 

Card related fees include interchange and merchant revenue, and fees related to debit and credit cards. Interchange revenue is related to the Company issued debit cards. Other deposit related fees primarily include pay by phone processing fees, ATM and safe deposit box fees, check order charges and foreign currency related fees. Card and deposit related fees are generally based on volume of transactions and are recognized at the point in time when the service has been performed. For any consideration that is constrained, the revenue is recognized once the uncertainty is known. Upfront fees received from certain contracts are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. Card and deposit related fees are recognized in the community banking segment.

Contract liabilities represent upfront fees that the Company received at inception of certain contracts. The revenue recognized that was included in the contract liability balance at beginning of the period totaled $ 1.3 million and $ 898,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Receivables are recognized in the period the Company provides services when the Company's right to consideration is unconditional. Card related fee receivable is the result of volume based fee that the Company receives from a customer on an annual basis in the second quarter of each year. Payment terms on other invoiced amounts are typically 30 days or less. Contract liabilities and receivables from contracts with customers are included within the accrued interest payable and other liabilities and accrued interest receivable and other assets line items, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. 

Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations 

For contracts with an original expected length of more than one year, the following table presents the estimated future timing of recognition of upfront fees related to card and deposit related fees. These upfront fees represent performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period.

Practical Expedients and Exemptions 

The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the Company transfers a promised service to a customer and when the customer pays for that services is one year or less. 

The Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognized is one year or less.

tax planning strategies and future taxable income. This conclusion is based on the Company&#8217;s historical earnings, its current level of earnings and prospects for continued growth and profitability. 

The Company has Federal net operating loss (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) carryforwards of $ 4.8 million that begin to expire in 2029 through 2037 and are subject to IRC Section 382 annual limitation. The NOL carryforwards were a result of acquisitions. 

The Company accounts for uncertainties in income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits: 

##TABLE_START Years Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 2020 Unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ 10,840 &#160; Gross increases for tax positions taken in current period &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Gross decreases for positions taken in prior periods &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 10,571 ) Settlements with taxing authorities &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; ( 269 ) Unrecognized tax benefits at end of year $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; ##TABLE_END 

At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. Interest and penalties on unrecognized tax positions are recorded in income tax expense. There was no interest income accrued on unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. Interest and penalties are included in the liability for uncertain tax positions, but are not included in the unrecognized tax benefits rollforward presented above. As of December 31, 2022, the Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase in the next 12 months. 

The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in numerous state jurisdictions and in Canada. In the ordinary course of business, we are routinely subject to audit by the taxing authorities of these jurisdictions. Currently, the Company&#8217;s U.S. federal income tax returns are open and subject to audit for the 2019 tax return year forward, and in general, the Company&#8217;s state income tax returns are open and subject to audit from the 2019 tax return year forward, subject to individual state statutes of limitation. The Company has extended the statute of limitations on certain state income tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2018 due to an ongoing audit. The Company&#8217;s Canadian subsidiary&#8217;s Canadian income tax returns are also subject to audit for the 2019 tax return year forward. 

(18) Stock Compensation Plans and Other Employee Benefit Plans 

Stock Incentive Plan 

In May 2022, the Company&#8217;s shareholders approved the 2022 Stock Incentive Plan (&#8220;the 2022 Plan&#8221;) which provides for the issuance of up to 1,200,000 shares of common stock plus any shares of common stock that were available for awards under the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (&#8220;the 2015 Plan&#8221;) as of the effective date of the 2022 Plan. The 2022 Plan replaced the 2015 Plan, and similarly, the 2015 Plan replaced the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (&#8220;the 2007 Plan&#8221;) and the 2007 Plan replaced the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan (&#8220;the 1997 Plan&#8221;). The 2022 Plan, 2015 Plan, 2007 Plan and the 1997 Plan are collectively referred to as &#8220;the Plans.&#8221; The 2022 Plan has substantially similar terms to the predecessor plans. Awards granted under the Plans for which common shares are not issued by reason of cancellation, forfeiture, lapse of such award or settlement of such award in cash, are again available under the 2022 Plan. All grants made after the approval of the 2022 Plan are made pursuant to the 2022 Plan. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 1.6 million shares were available for future grants assuming the maximum number of shares are issued for the performance awards outstanding. The Plans cover substantially all employees of Wintrust. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers all stock-based compensation programs and authorizes all awards granted pursuant to the Plans. 

The Plans permit the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, restricted share or unit awards, performance awards and other incentive awards valued in whole or in part by reference to the Company&#8217;s common stock, all on a stand-alone, combination or tandem basis. The Company historically awarded stock-based compensation in the form of time-vested non-qualified stock options and time-vested restricted share unit awards (&#8220;restricted shares&#8221;). The grants of options provide for the purchase of shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock at the fair market value of the stock on the date the options are granted. Stock options generally vest ratably over periods of three to five years and have a maximum term of ten years from the date of grant. Restricted shares entitle the holders to receive, at no cost, shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. Restricted shares generally vest over periods of one to five years from the date of grant. 

##TABLE_START 139 

##TABLE_END

Beginning in 2011, the Company has awarded annual grants under the Long-Term Incentive Program (&#8220;LTIP&#8221;), which is administered under the Plans. The LTIP is designed in part to align the interests of management with interests of shareholders, foster retention, create a long-term focus based on sustainable results and provide participants a target long-term incentive opportunity. LTIP grants in 2022 and 2021 consisted of a combination of performance-based stock awards with a performance condition metric, performance-based stock awards with a market condition metric and time-vested restricted shares, and in 2020 consisted of a combination of performance-based stock awards and performance-based cash awards (both with a performance condition metric) and time vested restricted shares. LTIP grants from 2017 through 2019 consisted of a combination of performance-based stock awards and performance-based cash awards, and prior to 2017, nonqualified stock options were in the mix of award types. Stock options granted under the LTIP have a term of seven years and generally vest equally over three years based on continued service. Performance-based stock and cash awards granted under the LTIP are contingent upon the achievement of pre-established long-term performance goals set in advance by the Compensation Committee over a three-year period starting at the beginning of each calendar year. Performance-based stock awards with a market condition metric are contingent on the total shareholder return performance over a three-year period relative to the KBW Regional Bank Index. These performance awards are granted at a target level, and based on the Company&#8217;s achievement of the pre-established long-term goals, the actual payouts can range from 0 % to a maximum of 150 % of the target award. The awards typically vest in the quarter after the end of the performance period upon certification of the payout by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Holders of performance-based stock awards are entitled to receive, at no cost, the shares earned based on the achievement of the pre-established long-term goals. 

Holders of restricted share awards and performance-based stock awards received under the Plans are not entitled to vote or receive cash dividends (or cash payments equal to the cash dividends) on the underlying common shares until the awards are vested and shares are issued. Shares that are vested but are not issuable pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements accrue additional shares based on the value of dividends otherwise paid. Except in limited circumstances, awards granted pursuant to the Plans are canceled upon termination of employment without any payment of consideration by the Company. 

Stock-based compensation is measured as the fair value of an award on the date of grant, and the measured cost is recognized over the period which the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The fair value of restricted share and performance-based stock awards with a performance metric is determined based on the average of the high and low trading prices on the grant date. The fair value of performance stock awards with a market condition metric is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model and the fair value of stock options is estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Monte Carlo simulation model and the Black-Scholes option-pricing model require the input of highly subjective assumptions and are sensitive to changes in the award&#8217;s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock, which can materially affect the fair value estimates. Management periodically reviews and adjusts the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of such awards when granted. No options have been granted since 2016. 

Stock-based compensation is recognized based on the number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest, taking into account expected forfeitures. In addition, for performance-based awards with a performance metric, an estimate is made of the number of shares expected to vest as a result of actual performance against the performance criteria in the award to determine the amount of compensation expense to recognize. The estimate is re-evaluated quarterly and total compensation expense is adjusted for any change in estimate in the current period. 

Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $ 31.7 million, $ 16.2 million and $( 4.9 ) million and the related tax benefits (expense) were $ 7.0 million, $ 3.7 million and $( 914,000 ) in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(2) Aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pretax intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the Company&#8217;s stock price at year end and the option exercise price, multiplied by the number of shares) that would have been received by the option holders if they had exercised their options on the last day of the year. Options with exercise prices above the year end stock price are excluded from the calculation of intrinsic value. The intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of the Company&#8217;s stock. 

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, was $ 6.7 million, $ 11.7 million and $ 4.1 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercises totaled $ 1.8 million, $ 3.1 million and $ 1.1 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

At December 31, 2022, the maximum number of performance-based shares that could be issued on outstanding awards if performance is attained at the maximum amount was approximately 800,000 shares. 

The actual tax benefit realized upon the vesting and issuance of restricted shares and performance-based stock is based on the fair value of the shares on the issue date, and the estimated tax benefit of the awards is based on fair value of the awards on the grant date. The actual tax benefit realized upon the vesting and issuance of restricted shares and performance-based stock in 2022 was $ 580,000 more than the expected tax benefit for those shares; in 2021 the actual tax benefit was $ 40,000 more than the expected tax benefit for those shares and in 2020 the actual tax benefit was $ 848,000 less than the expected tax benefit for those shares. These differences in actual and expected tax benefits were recorded to income tax expense. 

As of December 31, 2022, there was $ 37.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share based arrangements under the Plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years . The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 4.5 million, $ 1.5 million and $ 14.7 million, respectively. 

The Company issues new shares to satisfy its obligation to issue shares granted pursuant to the Plans. 

Cash Incentive and Retention Plan 

The Cash Incentive and Retention Plan (&#8220;CIRP&#8221;) allows the Company to provide cash compensation to the Company&#8217;s and its subsidiaries&#8217; officers and employees. The CIRP is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The CIRP generally provides for the grants of cash awards, which may be earned pursuant to the achievement of performance criteria established by the Compensation Committee and/or continued employment. The performance criteria, if any, established by the Compensation Committee must relate to one or more of the criteria specified in the CIRP, which includes: earnings, earnings growth, revenues, stock price, return on assets, return on equity, improvement of financial ratings, achievement of balance sheet or income statement objectives and expenses. These criteria may relate to the Company, a particular line of business or a specific subsidiary of the Company. The Company had no expense related to the CIRP in 2022, 2021 and 2020, and no awards were paid in those years. There were no outstanding awards under this plan at December 31, 2022. 

Other Employee Benefits 

Wintrust and its subsidiaries also provide 401(k) Retirement Savings Plans (&#8220;401(k) Plans&#8221;). The 401(k) Plans cover all employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. Contributions by employees are made through salary deferrals at their direction, subject to certain Plan and statutory limitations. Employer contributions to the 401(k) Plans are made at the employer&#8217;s discretion. Eligible participants that have contributed to the 401(k) Plans are eligible to share in an allocation of employer contributions. The Company&#8217;s expense for the employer contributions to the 401(k) Plans was approximately $ 16.2 million in 2022, $ 15.6 million in 2021, and $ 13.8 million in 2020. 

The Wintrust Financial Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan (&#8220;ESPP&#8221;) is designed to encourage greater stock ownership among employees, thereby enhancing employee commitment to the Company. The ESPP gives eligible employees the right to accumulate funds over an offering period to purchase shares of common stock. All shares offered under the ESPP will be either newly issued shares of the Company or shares issued from treasury, if any. In accordance with the ESPP, beginning January 1, 

##TABLE_START 142 

##TABLE_END

2015, the purchase price of the shares of common stock is equal to 95 % of the closing price of the Company&#8217;s common stock on the last day of the offering period. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, 40,421 , 44,021 and 75,763 , shares of common stock, respectively, were purchased by participants and no compensation expense was recorded. The Company plans to continue to offer common stock through this ESPP on an ongoing basis and, in 2021, increased the shares authorized under the ESPP by 200,000 shares. At December 31, 2022, the Company had an obligation to issue 8,638 shares of common stock to participants and had 212,472 shares available for future grants under the ESPP. 

The Company does not currently offer other postretirement benefits such as health care or other pension plans. 

Directors Deferred Fee and Stock Plan 

The Wintrust Financial Corporation Directors Deferred Fee and Stock Plan (&#8220;DDFS Plan&#8221;) allows directors of the Company and its subsidiaries to choose to receive payment of directors&#8217; fees in either cash or common stock of the Company and to defer the receipt of the fees. The DDFS Plan is designed to encourage stock ownership by directors. All shares offered under the DDFS Plan will be either newly issued shares of the Company or shares issued from treasury. The number of shares issued is determined on a quarterly basis based on the fees earned during the quarter and the fair market value per share of the common stock on the last trading day of the preceding quarter. The shares are issued annually and the directors are entitled to dividends and voting rights upon the issuance of the shares. During 2020, an additional 200,000 shares were authorized under the DDFS Plan. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, a total of 59,174 shares, 23,909 shares and 19,928 shares, respectively, were issued to directors. For those directors that elect to defer the receipt of the common stock, the Company maintains records of stock units representing an obligation to issue shares of common stock. The number of stock units equals the number of shares that would have been issued had the director not elected to defer receipt of the shares. Additional stock units are credited at the time dividends are paid, however no voting rights are associated with the stock units. The shares of common stock represented by the stock units are issued in the year specified by the directors in their participation agreements. At December 31, 2022, the Company has an obligation to issue 313,409 shares of common stock to directors and has 121,119 shares available for future grants under the DDFS Plan. 

(19) Regulatory Matters 

Banking laws place restrictions upon the amount of dividends that can be paid to Wintrust by the banks. Based on these laws, the banks could, subject to minimum capital requirements, declare dividends to Wintrust without obtaining regulatory approval in an amount not exceeding (a) undivided profits, and (b) the amount of net income reduced by dividends paid for the current and prior two years. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, cash dividends totaling $ 52.0 million, $ 145.0 million and $ 253.0 million, respectively, were paid to Wintrust by the banks and other subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, the banks had approximately $ 703.8 million available to be paid as dividends to Wintrust without prior regulatory approval and without reducing their capital below the well-capitalized level. 

The banks are also required by the Federal Reserve Act to maintain reserves against deposits. Reserves are held either in the form of vault cash or balances maintained with the FRB and are based on the average daily deposit balances and statutory reserve ratios prescribed by the type of deposit account. In March 2020, the FRB adopted a rule to amend its reserve regulation which included lowering the reserve requirement to zero percent. As a result, at December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 there were no reserve balances required to be maintained at the FRB. 

The Company and the banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements established by the federal banking agencies that take into account risk attributable to balance sheet and off-balance sheet activities. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory &#8212; and possibly discretionary &#8212; actions by regulators, that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on the Company&#8217;s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the banks must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company&#8217;s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. 

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the banks to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and Tier 1 leverage capital (as defined) to average quarterly assets (as defined). The Federal Reserve&#8217;s capital guidelines require bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0 %, of which at least 4.50 % must be in the form of Common Equity Tier 1 capital and 6.0 % must be in the form of Tier 1 capital. The Federal Reserve also requires a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets of 4.0 %. In addition, the Federal Reserve continues to consider the Tier 1 leverage ratio in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities.

Wintrust&#8217;s mortgage banking division and broker/dealer subsidiary are also required to maintain minimum net worth capital requirements with various governmental agencies. The mortgage banking division&#8217;s net worth requirements are governed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the broker/dealer&#8217;s net worth requirements are governed by the SEC. As of December 31, 2022, these business units met their minimum net worth capital requirements. 

(20) Commitments and Contingencies 

The Company has outstanding, at any time, a number of commitments to extend credit. These commitments include revolving home equity line and other credit agreements, term loan commitments and standby and commercial letters of credit. Standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Standby letters of credit are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of the underlying contract with the third party, while commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate commerce and typically result in the commitment being drawn on when the underlying transaction is consummated between the customer and the third party. 

These commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Commitments to extend commercial, commercial real estate and construction loans totaled $ 9.5 billion and $ 7.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and unused home equity lines totaled $ 796.9 million and $ 749.4 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Standby and commercial letters of credit totaled $ 344.4 million at December 31, 2022 and $ 351.1 million at December 31, 2021. 

In addition, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had approximately $ 181.0 million and $ 590.0 million, respectively, in commitments to fund residential mortgage loans to be sold into the secondary market. These lending commitments are also considered derivative instruments. The Company also enters into forward contracts for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans at specified interest rates to reduce the interest rate risk associated with commitments to fund loans as well as mortgage loans held-for-sale. These forward contracts are also considered derivative instruments and had contractual amounts of approximately $ 321.0 million at December 31, 2022 and $ 952.3 million at December 31, 2021. See Note (21) &#8220;Derivative Financial Instruments&#8221; in Item 8 of this report for further discussion on derivative instruments. 

The Company enters into residential mortgage loan sale agreements with investors in the normal course of business. These agreements usually require certain representations concerning credit information, loan documentation, collateral and insurability. On occasion, investors have requested the Company to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans which the investors believe do not comply with applicable representations. Management maintains a liability for estimated losses on loans expected to be repurchased or on which indemnification is expected to be provided and regularly 

##TABLE_START 146 

##TABLE_END

evaluates the adequacy of this recourse liability based on trends in repurchase and indemnification requests, actual loss experience, known and inherent risks in the loans, and current economic conditions. 

The Company sold approximately $ 3.1 billion of mortgage loans in 2022 and $ 7.4 billion in 2021. The liability for estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification claims for residential mortgage loans previously sold to investors was approximately $ 624,000 and $ 675,000 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and was included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Losses charged against the liability were $ 60,000 in 2022 as compared to $ 219,000 in 2021. These losses relate to mortgages which experienced early payment and other defaults meeting certain representation and warranty recourse requirements. 

The Company had unfunded commitments to investment partnerships that qualify for CRA purposes totaling $ 50.9 million and $ 40.3 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of these commitments, on both reporting dates, $ 7.1 million related to legally-binding unfunded commitments for tax-credit investments and were included within other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Condition as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 

The Company utilizes an out-sourced securities clearing platform and has agreed to indemnify the clearing broker of Wintrust Investments for losses that it may sustain from the customer accounts introduced by Wintrust Investments. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total amount of customer balances maintained by the clearing broker and subject to indemnification was approximately $ 15.8 million and $ 22.5 million, respectively. Wintrust Investments seeks to control the risks associated with its customers&#8217; activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with various regulatory and internal guidelines. 

Litigation Matters 

In accordance with applicable accounting principles, the Company establishes an accrued liability for litigation and threatened litigation actions and proceedings when those actions present loss contingencies, which are both probable and estimable. In actions for which a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, the Company determines whether it can estimate a loss or range of possible loss. To determine whether a possible loss is estimable, the Company reviews and evaluates its material litigation on an ongoing basis, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. This review may include information learned through the discovery process, rulings on substantive or dispositive motions, and settlement discussions. 

Wintrust Mortgage Matter 

On October 17, 2018, a former Wintrust Mortgage employee filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California against Wintrust Mortgage alleging violation of California wage payment statutes on behalf of herself and all other hourly, non-exempt employees of Wintrust Mortgage in California. Wintrust Mortgage received service of the complaint on November 4, 2018. Wintrust Mortgage filed its response to the complaint on February 25, 2019. On November 1, 2019, the plaintiff's counsel filed a letter with the California Department of Labor advising that it was initiating an action under California's Private Attorney General Act statute based on the same alleged violations. In November 2019, the parties reached a settlement agreement. The parties executed a settlement agreement and on February 26, 2020, plaintiff moved the court for approval. A hearing on the motion to approve settlement was originally set for June 16, 2020, but the court continued the motion to September 8, 2020. On September 8, 2020, the court requested the parties make certain changes to the settlement agreement that were immaterial to the parties&#8217; settlement terms. The parties revised the settlement agreement consistent with the court's recommendations and submitted the revised settlement agreement to the court for its approval. On January 27, 2021, the court entered its preliminary approval of the settlement. After no class members opted out or objected to the settlement, the court issued its final approval of the settlement on June 17, 2021 and on June 18, 2021, Wintrust Mortgage tendered the settlement amount to the class claims administrator. Payments to class members have been completed and this matter is closed. The Company had reserved an amount for this settlement that is immaterial to its results of operations or financial condition. 

Wintrust Mortgage California PAGA Matter 

On May 24, 2022, a former Wintrust Mortgage employee filed a California Private Attorney General Act (&#8220;PAGA&#8221;) suit, not individually, but as representative of all Wintrust Mortgage&#8217;s California hourly employees, against Wintrust Mortgage in the Superior Court of San Diego County, California. Plaintiff alleges Wintrust Mortgage failed to provide: (i) accurate sick leave accrual and pay; (ii) overtime wages; (iii) accurately itemized wage statements; (iv) meal breaks and meal premiums; (v) timely payment of earned wages; (vi) payment of all earned wages; and (vii) payment of all vested vacation hours. Wintrust Mortgage disputes the validity of Plaintiff&#8217;s claims and believes, to the extent there were defects in complying with California law governing the payment of compensation to Plaintiff, such errors would have been de minimis. Plaintiff also has an arbitration agreement with a collective and class action waiver. On January 19, 2023, Wintrust Mortgage moved to compel arbitration. The court entered and continued the motion until June 23, 2023 and stayed further proceedings in anticipation of a California Supreme Court decision on PAGA arbitrations. We believe plaintiff&#8217;s allegations to be legally and factually meritless and otherwise lack sufficient information to estimate the amount of any potential liability.

Wintrust Mortgage Fair Lending Matter 

On May 25, 2022, a Wintrust Mortgage customer filed a putative class action and asserted individual claims against Wintrust Mortgage and Wintrust Financial Corporation in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Plaintiff alleges that Wintrust Mortgage discriminated against black/African American borrowers and brings class claims under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Sections 1981 and 1982 under Chapter 42 of the United States Code; and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. Plaintiff also asserts individual claims under theories of promissory estoppel, fraudulent inducement, and breach of contract. On September 23, 2022, Wintrust filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff&#8217;s amended compliant. The motion to dismiss has been fully briefed and the parties are awaiting a decision by the court. We vigorously dispute these allegations, believe them to be legally and factually meritless, and otherwise lack sufficient information to estimate the amount of any potential liability. 

Wintrust ERISA Matter 

On July 29, 2022, a former Wintrust employee filed a class action in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois asserting claims under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;) against Wintrust. Plaintiff alleges Wintrust breached its fiduciary duty in the selection of BlackRock Target Date funds for inclusion in its 401(k) plan, that Wintrust failed to monitor the performance of those funds, and in the alternative, Wintrust should be liable for breach of trust. Plaintiff&#8217;s sole basis for the allegations is that BlackRock Target Date funds allegedly performed more poorly than two comparable funds over a three year period. On November 8, 2022, Wintrust filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff&#8217;s amended complaint. The motion has been fully briefed. We believe plaintiff&#8217;s allegations to be legally and factually meritless and otherwise lack sufficient information to estimate the amount of any potential liability. 

Other Matters 

In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries, from time to time, are subject to pending and threatened legal action and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. 

Based on information currently available and upon consultation with counsel, management believes that the eventual outcome of any pending or threatened legal actions and proceedings described above, including our ordinary course litigation, will not have a material adverse effect on the operations or financial condition of the Company. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations or financial condition for a particular period. 

(21) Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company primarily enters into derivative financial instruments as part of its strategy to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivative instruments represent contracts between parties that result in one party delivering cash to the other party based on a notional amount and an underlying term (such as a rate, security price or price index or commodity price) as specified in the contract. The amount of cash delivered from one party to the other is determined based on the interaction of the notional amount of the contract with the underlying term. Derivatives are also implicit in certain contracts and commitments. 

The derivative financial instruments currently used by the Company to manage its exposure to interest rate risk include: (1) interest rate swaps and collars to manage the interest rate risk of certain fixed and variable rate assets and variable rate liabilities; (2) interest rate lock commitments provided to customers to fund certain mortgage loans to be sold into the secondary market; (3) forward commitments for the future delivery of such mortgage loans to protect the Company from adverse changes in interest rates and corresponding changes in the value of mortgage loans held-for-sale; (4) covered call options to economically hedge specific investment securities and receive fee income, effectively enhancing the overall yield on such securities to compensate for net interest margin compression; and (5) options and swaps to economically hedge a portion of the fair value adjustments related to the Company&#8217;s mortgage servicing rights portfolio. The Company also enters into derivatives (typically interest rate swaps and commodity forward contracts) with certain qualified borrowers to facilitate the borrowers&#8217; risk management strategies and concurrently enters into mirror-image derivatives with a third party counterparty, effectively making a market in the derivatives for such borrowers. Additionally, the Company enters into foreign currency contracts to manage foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency denominated assets. 

The Company recognizes derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the instrument. The Company records derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Condition within accrued interest receivable and other assets and accrued interest payable and other liabilities, respectively. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in income or in shareholders&#8217; equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting and, if so, whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge. 

##TABLE_START 148 

##TABLE_END

Changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges are recorded in income in the same period and in the same income statement line as changes in the fair values of the hedged items that relate to the hedged risk(s). Changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of deferred taxes, and reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments not designated in a hedging relationship pursuant to ASC 815 are reported in non-interest income during the period of the change. Derivative financial instruments are valued by a third party and are corroborated by comparison with valuations provided by the respective counterparties. Fair values of certain mortgage banking derivatives (interest rate lock commitments and forward commitments to sell mortgage loans) are estimated based on changes in mortgage interest rates from the date of the loan commitment. The fair value of foreign currency derivatives is computed based on changes in foreign currency rates stated in the contract compared to those prevailing at the measurement date. Commodity derivative fair values are computed based on changes in the price per unit stated in the contract compared to those prevailing at the measurement date. 

The table below presents the fair value of the Company&#8217;s derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021:

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 

The Company&#8217;s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to net interest income and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish these objectives, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and interest rate collars as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts to or from a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving or paying fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate collars designated as cash flow hedges involve the settlement of amounts in which the interest rate specified in the contract exceeds the agreed upon cap strike price or in which the interest rate specified in the contract is below the agreed upon floor strike price at the end of each period. 

As of December 31, 2022, the Company had various interest rate collar derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate loans. When the relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument is highly effective at achieving offsetting changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and are subsequently reclassified to interest income as interest payments are made on such variable rate loans. The changes in fair value (net of tax) are separately disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 

##TABLE_START 149

The table below provides details on these cash flow hedges, summarized by derivative type and maturity, as of December 31, 2022:

In the first quarter of 2022, the Company terminated interest rate swap derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate deposits with a total notional value of $ 1.0 billion and a five-year term effective July 2022. At the time of termination, the fair value of the derivative contracts totaled an asset of $ 66.5 million, with such adjustments to fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. In the second quarter of 2022, the Company terminated two additional interest rate swap derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate deposits with a total notional value of $ 500.0 million each effective since April 2020. The remaining terms of such derivative contracts were through March 2023 and April 2024 and, at the time of termination, the fair value of the derivative contracts totaled assets of $ 3.7 million and $ 10.7 million, respectively, with such adjustments to fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company terminated one additional interest rate collar derivative contract designated as a cash flow hedge of the Term Facility with a total notional value of $ 64.3 million effective since September 2018. The remaining term of such derivative contract was through September 2023 and, at the time of termination, the fair value of the derivative contract totaled an asset of $ 875,000 , with such adjustments to fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. 

For all such terminations, as the hedged forecasted transactions (interest payments on variable rate deposits and the Term Facility) are still expected to occur over the remaining term of such terminated derivatives, such adjustments will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and be reclassified as a reduction to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the original term of the terminated derivative contracts. 

A rollforward of the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to interest rate derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, including such derivative contracts terminated during the period, follows: 

##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended December 31, (In thousands) 2022 2021 Unrealized gain (loss) at beginning of period $ 36,908 &#160; $ ( 31,533 ) Amount reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income or loss to interest expense on deposits, loans, other borrowings and junior subordinated debentures ( 3,319 ) 26,883 &#160; Amount of (loss) gain recognized in other comprehensive income or loss ( 23,563 ) 41,558 &#160; Unrealized gain at end of period $ 10,026 &#160; $ 36,908 &#160; ##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2022, the Company estimated that during the next 12 months, $ 11.0 million will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income or loss as a decrease to net interest income. Such estimate consists of $ 20.3 million reclassified as a reduction to interest expense on the terminated cash flow hedges discussed above, more than offset by estimated amounts to be reclassified as a reduction to interest income related to the interest rate collars noted above that remain outstanding. 

Fair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 

Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the payment of fixed amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has 14 interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $ 207.2 million that were designated as fair value hedges primarily associated with fixed rate commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans as well as life insurance premium finance receivables. 

##TABLE_START 150 

##TABLE_END

For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss from the entire change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recognized in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect, including the net gain or loss, of the hedged item (interest income earned on fixed rate loans) when the hedged item affects earnings. 

The following table presents the carrying amount of the hedged assets/(liabilities) and the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the hedged assets/(liabilities) that are designated as a fair value hedge accounting relationship as of December 31, 2022:

Non-Designated Hedges 

The Company does not use derivatives for speculative purposes. Derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are used to manage the Company&#8217;s economic exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks but do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements of ASC 815. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded directly in earnings. 

Interest Rate Derivatives &#8212;Periodically, the Company may purchase interest rate cap derivatives designed to act as an economic hedge of the risk of the negative impact on its fixed-rate loan portfolios from rising interest rates, most recently related to the LIBOR index. As of December 31, 2022, there were no interest rate caps outstanding that were designed to act as an economic hedge. During 2022, the Company terminated an interest rate cap derivative contract related to LIBOR that was not designated as an accounting hedge with a total notional value of $ 1.0 billion. 

Additionally, the Company has interest rate derivatives, including swaps and option products, resulting from a service the Company provides to certain qualified borrowers. The Company&#8217;s banking subsidiaries execute certain derivative products (typically interest rate swaps) directly with qualified commercial borrowers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. For example, these arrangements allow the Company&#8217;s commercial borrowers to effectively convert a variable rate loan to a fixed rate. In order to minimize the Company&#8217;s exposure on these transactions, the Company simultaneously executes offsetting derivatives with third parties. In most cases, the offsetting derivatives have mirror-image terms, which result in the positions&#8217; changes in fair value substantially offsetting through earnings each period. However, to the extent that the derivatives are not a mirror-image and because of differences in counterparty credit risk, changes in fair value will not completely offset resulting in some earnings impact each period. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in other non-interest income. At December 31, 2022, the Company had interest rate derivative transactions with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $ 9.6 billion (all interest rate swaps and caps with customers and third parties) related to this program. These interest rate derivatives had maturity dates ranging from January 2023 to January 2037. 

Mortgage Banking Derivatives&#8212; These derivatives include interest rate lock commitments provided to customers to fund certain mortgage loans to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of such loans. It is the Company&#8217;s practice to enter into forward commitments for the future delivery of a portion of our residential mortgage loan production when interest rate lock commitments are entered into in order to economically hedge the effect of future changes in interest rates on its commitments to fund the loans as well as on its portfolio of mortgage loans held-for-sale. The Company&#8217;s 

##TABLE_START 151 

##TABLE_END

mortgage banking derivatives have not been designated as being in hedge relationships. At December 31, 2022, the Company had interest rate lock commitments with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $ 121.6 million and forward commitments to sell mortgage loans with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $ 321.0 million. The fair values of these derivatives were estimated based on changes in mortgage rates from the dates of the commitments. Changes in the fair value of these mortgage banking derivatives are included in mortgage banking revenue. 

Commodity Derivatives&#8212; The Company has commodity forward contracts resulting from a service the Company provides to certain qualified borrowers. The Company&#8217;s banking subsidiaries execute certain derivative products directly with qualified commercial borrowers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. For example, these arrangements allow the Company&#8217;s commercial borrowers to effectively purchase or sell a given commodity at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. In order to minimize the Company&#8217;s exposure on these transactions, the Company simultaneously executes offsetting derivatives with third parties. In most cases, the offsetting derivatives have mirror-image terms, which result in the positions&#8217; changes in fair value substantially offsetting through earnings each period. However, to the extent that the derivatives are not a mirror-image and because of differences in counterparty credit risk, changes in fair value will not completely offset resulting in some earnings impact each period. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in other non-interest income. At December 31, 2022, the Company had commodity derivative transactions with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $ 3.6 million (all forward contracts with customers and third parties) related to this program. These commodity derivatives had maturity dates ranging from January 2023 to December 2023. There were no commodity derivatives outstanding as of December 31, 2021. 

Foreign Currency Derivatives&#8212; The Company has foreign currency derivative contracts resulting from a service the Company provides to certain qualified customers. The Company&#8217;s banking subsidiaries execute certain derivative products directly with qualified customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies related to foreign currency fluctuations. For example, these arrangements allow the Company&#8217;s customers to effectively exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. In order to minimize the Company&#8217;s exposure on these transactions, the Company simultaneously executes offsetting derivatives with third parties. In most cases, the offsetting derivatives have mirror-image terms, which result in the positions&#8217; changes in fair value substantially offsetting through earnings each period. However, to the extent that the derivatives are not a mirror-image and because of differences in counterparty credit risk, changes in fair value will not completely offset resulting in some earnings impact each period. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in other non-interest income. As of December 31, 2022, the Company held foreign currency derivatives with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $ 226.2 million. 

Other Derivatives&#8212; Periodically, the Company will sell options to a bank or dealer for the right to purchase certain securities held within the banks&#8217; investment portfolios (covered call options). These option transactions are designed to increase the total return associated with the investment securities portfolio. These options do not qualify as accounting hedges pursuant to ASC 815 and, accordingly, changes in fair value of these contracts are recognized as other non-interest income. There were no covered call options outstanding as of December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. 

Periodically, the Company will purchase options for the right to purchase securities not currently held within the banks&#8217; investment portfolios or enter into interest rate swaps in which the Company elects to not designate such derivatives as hedging instruments. These option and swap transactions are designed primarily to economically hedge a portion of the fair value adjustments related to the Company&#8217;s mortgage servicing rights portfolio. The gain or loss associated with these derivative contracts are included in mortgage banking revenue. As of December 31, 2022, the Company held three interest rate derivatives with an aggregate notional value of $ 190.0 million for such purpose of economically hedging a portion of the fair value adjustment related to its mortgage servicing rights portfolio. There were no such options or swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2021.

Credit Risk 

Derivative instruments have inherent risks, primarily market risk and credit risk. Market risk is associated with changes in interest rates and credit risk relates to the risk that the counterparty will fail to perform according to the terms of the agreement. The amounts potentially subject to market and credit risks are the streams of interest payments under the contracts and the market value of the derivative instrument and not the notional principal amounts used to express the volume of the transactions. Market and credit risks are managed and monitored as part of the Company&#8217;s overall asset-liability management process, except that the credit risk related to derivatives entered into with certain qualified borrowers is managed through the Company&#8217;s standard loan underwriting process since these derivatives are secured through collateral provided by the loan agreements. Actual exposures are monitored against various types of credit limits established to contain risk within parameters. When deemed necessary, appropriate types and amounts of collateral are obtained to minimize credit exposure. 

The Company has agreements with certain of its interest rate derivative counterparties that contain cross-default provisions, which provide that if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. The Company also has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision allowing the counterparty to terminate the derivative positions if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well or adequately capitalized institution, which would require the Company to settle its obligations under the agreements. As of December 31, 2022, there were no interest rate derivatives in a net liability position that were subject to such agreements. The fair value of such derivatives includes accrued interest related to these agreements. 

The Company is also exposed to the credit risk of its commercial borrowers who are counterparties to interest rate derivatives with the banks. This counterparty risk related to the commercial borrowers is managed and monitored through the banks&#8217; standard underwriting process applicable to loans since these derivatives are secured through collateral provided by the loan agreement. The counterparty risk associated with the mirror-image swaps executed with third parties is monitored and managed in connection with the Company&#8217;s overall asset liability management process. 

The Company records interest rate derivatives subject to master netting agreements at their gross value and does not offset derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. The table below summarizes the Company&#8217;s interest rate derivatives and offsetting positions as of the dates shown.

(22) Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities 

The Company measures, monitors and discloses certain of its assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. These financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the observability of the inputs used to determine fair value. These levels are: 

&#8226; Level 1 &#8212; unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

&#8226; Level 2 &#8212; inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 

&#8226; Level 3 &#8212; significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Company&#8217;s own assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 

A financial instrument&#8217;s categorization within the above valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company&#8217;s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the assets or liabilities. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 

Available-for-sale debt securities, trading account securities and equity securities with readily determinable fair value &#8212; Fair values for available-for-sale debt securities, trading account securities and equity securities with readily determinable fair value are typically based on prices obtained from independent pricing vendors. Securities measured with these valuation techniques are generally classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Typically, standard inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades for similar securities, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including market research publications are used to determine the fair value these securities. When these inputs are not available, broker/dealer quotes may be obtained by the vendor to determine the fair value of the security. We review the vendor&#8217;s pricing methodologies to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. Fair value measurements using significant inputs that are unobservable in the market due to limited activity or a less liquid market are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of U.S. Treasury securities and certain equity securities with readily determinable fair value are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. As such, these securities are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. 

The Company&#8217;s Investment Operations Department is responsible for the valuation of Level 3 available-for-sale debt securities. The methodology and variables used as inputs in pricing Level 3 securities are derived from a combination of observable and unobservable inputs. The unobservable inputs are determined through internal assumptions that may vary from period to period due to external factors, such as market movement and credit rating adjustments. 

At December 31, 2022, the Company classified $ 117.5 million of municipal securities as Level 3. These municipal securities are bond issues for various municipal government entities primarily located in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin and are privately placed, non-rated bonds without CUSIP numbers. The Company&#8217;s methodology for pricing these securities focuses on three distinct inputs: equivalent rating, yield and other pricing terms. To determine the rating for a given non-rated investment debt security, the Investment Operations Department references a rated, publicly issued bond by the same issuer if available. A reduction is then applied to the rating obtained from the comparable bond, as the Company believes if liquidated, a non-rated bond would be valued less than a similar bond with a verifiable rating. The reduction applied by the Company is one complete rating grade (i.e., a &#8220;AA&#8221; rating for a comparable bond would be reduced to &#8220;A&#8221; for the Company&#8217;s valuation). For bond issues without comparable bond proxies, a rating of &#8220;BBB&#8221; was assigned. For the year ended December 31, 2022, all of the ratings derived by the Investment Operations Department using the above process were &#8220;BBB&#8221; or better. The fair value measurement noted above is sensitive to the rating input, as a higher rating typically results in an increased valuation. The remaining pricing inputs used in the bond valuation are observable. Based on the rating determined in the above process, Investment Operations obtains a corresponding current market yield curve available to market participants. Other terms including coupon, maturity date, redemption price, number of coupon payments per year, and accrual method are obtained from the individual bond term sheets. Certain municipal bonds held by the Company at December 31, 2022 are 

##TABLE_START 154 

##TABLE_END

continuously callable. When valuing these bonds, the fair value is capped at par value as the Company assumes a market participant would not pay more than par for a continuously callable bond. 

Mortgage loans held-for-sale &#8212; The fair value of mortgage loans held-for-sale is typically determined by reference to investor price sheets for loan products with similar characteristics. Loans measured with this valuation technique are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 

At December 31, 2022, the Company classified $ 48.7 million of certain delinquent mortgage loans held-for-sale as Level 3. For such delinquent loans in which investor interest may be limited, the Company estimates fair value by discounting future scheduled cash flows for the specific loan through its life, adjusted for estimated credit losses. The Company uses a discount rate based on prevailing market coupon rates on loans with similar characteristics. The assumed weighted average discount rate used as an input to value these loans at December 31, 2022 was 6.21 %. The higher the rate utilized to discount estimated future cash flows, the lower the fair value measurement. Additionally, the weighted average credit discount used as an input to value the specific loans was 0.33 % with a credit loss discount ranging from 0 % to 12 % at December 31, 2022. 

Loans held-for-investment &#8212; The fair value for certain loans in which the Company previously elected the fair value option is estimated by discounting future scheduled cash flows for the specific loan through maturity, adjusted for estimated credit losses and prepayment or life assumptions. These loans primarily consist of early buyout loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are delinquent and, as a result, investor interest may be limited. The Company uses a discount rate based on the actual coupon rate of the underlying loan. At December 31, 2022, the Company classified $ 84.2 million of loans held-for-investment carried at fair value as Level 3. The assumed weighted average discount rate used as an input to value these loans at December 31, 2022 was 6.26 %. The higher the rate utilized to discount estimated future cash flows, the lower the fair value measurement. As noted above, the fair value estimate also includes assumptions of prepayment speeds and average life as well as credit losses. The weighted average prepayments speed used as an input to value current loans was 6.62 % at December 31, 2022. Prepayment speeds are inversely related to the fair value of these loans as an increase in prepayment speeds results in a decreased valuation. For delinquent loans in which performance is not assumed and there is a higher probability of resolution of the loan ending in foreclosure, the weighted average life of such loans was 5.8 years. Average life is inversely related to the fair value of these loans as an increase in estimated life results in a decreased valuation. Additionally, the weighted average credit discount used as an input to value the specific loans was 0.77 % with credit loss discounts ranging from 0 % to 12 % at December 31, 2022. 

MSRs &#8212; Fair value for MSRs is determined utilizing a valuation model which calculates the fair value of each servicing right based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The Company uses a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with each servicing right, given current market conditions. At December 31, 2022, the Company classified $ 230.2 million of MSRs as Level 3. The weighted average discount rate used as an input to value the pool of MSRs at December 31, 2022 was 10.30 % with discount rates applied ranging from 7 % to 24 %. The higher the rate utilized to discount estimated future cash flows, the lower the fair value measurement. The fair value of MSRs was also estimated based on other assumptions including prepayment speeds and the cost to service. Prepayment speeds ranged from 0 % to 100 % or a weighted average prepayment speed of 6.62 %. Further, for current and delinquent loans, the Company assumed a weighted average cost of servicing of $ 75 and $ 343 , respectively, per loan. Prepayment speeds and the cost to service are both inversely related to the fair value of MSRs as an increase in prepayment speeds or the cost to service results in a decreased valuation. See Note (6) &#8220;Mortgage Servicing Rights (&#8220;MSRs&#8221;)&#8221; for further discussion of MSRs. 

Derivative instruments &#8212; The Company&#8217;s derivative instruments include interest rate swaps, caps and collars, commitments to fund mortgages for sale into the secondary market (interest rate locks), forward commitments to end investors for the sale of mortgage loans, commodity future contracts and foreign currency contracts. Interest rate swaps, caps and collars and commodity future contracts are valued by a third party, using models that primarily use market observable inputs, such as yield curves and commodity prices prevailing at the measurement date, and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The credit risk associated with derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements is measured on a net basis by counterparty portfolio. The fair value for mortgage-related derivatives is based on changes in mortgage rates from the date of the commitments. The fair value of foreign currency derivatives is computed based on change in foreign currency rates stated in the contract compared to those prevailing at the measurement date. 

At December 31, 2022, the Company classified $ 1.7 million of derivative assets related to interest rate locks as Level 3. The fair value of interest rate locks is based on prices obtained for loans with similar characteristics from third parties, adjusted for the pull-through rate, which represents the Company&#8217;s best estimate of the likelihood that a committed loan will ultimately fund. The weighted-average pull-through rate at December 31, 2022 was 86.12 % with pull-through rates applied ranging from 35 % to 100 %. Pull-through rates are directly related to the fair value of interest rate locks as an increase in the pull-through rate results in an increased valuation.

Nonqualified deferred compensation assets &#8212; The underlying assets relating to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan are included in a trust and primarily consist of non-exchange traded institutional funds which are priced based by an independent third party service. These assets are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

(1) Changes in the balance of mortgage loans held-for-sale, MSRs and derivative assets related to fair value adjustments are recorded as a component of mortgage banking revenue. Changes in the balance of loans held-for-investment related to fair value adjustments are recorded as other non-interest income. 

Also, the Company may be required, from time to time, to measure certain other assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis in accordance with GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from impairment charges on individual assets. For assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis that were still held in the balance sheet at the end of the period, the following table provides the carrying value of the related individual assets or portfolios at December 31, 2022.

##TABLE_END

Individually assessed loans &#8212; In accordance with ASC 326, the allowance for credit losses for loans and other financial assets held at amortized cost should be measured on a collective or pooled basis when such assets exhibit similar risk characteristics. In instances in which a financial asset does not exhibit similar risk characteristics to a pool, the Company is required to measure such allowance for credit losses on an individual asset basis. For the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio, nonaccrual loans and TDRs are considered to not exhibit similar risk characteristics as pools and thus are individually assessed. Credit losses are measured by estimating the fair value of the loan based on the present value of expected cash flows, the market price of the loan, or the fair value of the underlying collateral. Individually assessed loans are considered a fair value measurement where an allowance for credit loss is established based on the fair value of collateral. Appraised values on relevant real estate properties, which may require adjustments to market-based valuation inputs, are generally used on foreclosure probable and collateral-dependent loans within the real estate portfolios. 

The Company&#8217;s Managed Assets Division is primarily responsible for the valuation of Level 3 inputs of individually assessed loans. For more information on individually assessed loans refer to Note (5) &#8220;Allowance for Credit Losses&#8221;. At December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 90.2 million of individually assessed loans classified as Level 3. Of the $ 90.2 million of individually assessed loans, $ 69.0 million were measured at fair value based on the underlying collateral of the loan as shown in the table above. The remaining $ 21.2 million were valued based on discounted cash flows in accordance with ASC 310. 

Other real estate owned &#8212; Other real estate owned is comprised of real estate acquired in partial or full satisfaction of loans and is included in other assets. Other real estate owned is recorded at its estimated fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of transfer, with any excess of the related loan balance over the fair value less expected selling costs charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent changes in value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount and are recorded in other non-interest expense. Gains and losses upon sale, if any, are also charged to other non-interest expense. Fair value is generally based on third party appraisals and internal estimates that are adjusted by a discount representing the estimated cost of sale and is therefore considered a Level 3 valuation. 

The Company&#8217;s Managed Assets Division is primarily responsible for the valuation of Level 3 inputs for other real estate owned. At December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 9.9 million of other real estate owned classified as Level 3. The unobservable input applied to other real estate owned relates to the 10 % reduction to the appraisal value representing the estimated cost of sale of the foreclosed property. A higher discount for the estimated cost of sale results in a decreased carrying value.

Not all the financial instruments listed in the table above are subject to the disclosure provisions of ASC Topic 820, as certain assets and liabilities result in their carrying value approximating fair value. These include cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing deposits with banks, brokerage customer receivables, FHLB and FRB stock, accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable and non-maturity deposits. 

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair values of financial instruments that were not previously disclosed. 

Held-to-maturity securities &#8212; Held-to-maturity securities include U.S. Government-sponsored agency securities, municipal bonds issued by various municipal government entities primarily located in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin and mortgage-backed securities. Fair values for held-to-maturity securities are typically based on prices obtained from independent pricing vendors. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has generally categorized these held-to-maturity securities as a Level 2 fair value measurement. Fair values for certain other held-to-maturity securities are based on the bond pricing methodology discussed previously related to certain available-for-sale securities. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized these held-to-maturity securities as a Level 3 fair value measurement. 

Loans held-for-investment, at amortized cost &#8212; Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are analyzed by type such as commercial, residential real estate, etc. Each category is further segmented by interest rate type (fixed and variable) and term. For variable-rate loans that reprice frequently, estimated fair values are based 

##TABLE_START 160 

##TABLE_END

on carrying values. The fair value of residential loans is based on secondary market sources for securities backed by similar loans, adjusted for differences in loan characteristics. The fair value for other fixed rate loans is estimated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using estimated market discount rates that reflect credit and interest rate risks inherent in the loan. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized loans as a Level 3 fair value measurement. 

Deposits with stated maturities &#8212; The fair value of certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently in effect for deposits of similar remaining maturities. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized deposits with stated maturities as a Level 3 fair value measurement. 

FHLB advances &#8212; The fair value of FHLB advances is obtained from the FHLB, which uses a discounted cash flow analysis based on current market rates of similar maturity debt securities to discount cash flows. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized FHLB advances as a Level 3 fair value measurement. 

Subordinated notes &#8212; The fair value of the subordinated notes is based on a market price obtained from an independent pricing vendor. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized subordinated notes as a Level 2 fair value measurement. 

Junior subordinated debentures &#8212; The fair value of the junior subordinated debentures is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized junior subordinated debentures as a Level 3 fair value measurement.

(24) Segment Information 

The Company&#8217;s operations consist of three primary segments: community banking, specialty finance and wealth management. 

The three reportable segments are strategic business units that are separately managed as they offer different products and services and have different marketing strategies. In addition, each segment&#8217;s customer base has varying characteristics and each segment has a different regulatory environment. While the Company&#8217;s management monitors each of the fifteen bank subsidiaries&#8217; operations and profitability separately, these subsidiaries have been aggregated into one reportable operating segment due to the similarities in products and services, customer base, operations, profitability measures and economic characteristics. 

For purposes of internal segment profitability, management allocates certain intersegment and parent company balances. Management allocates a portion of revenues to the specialty finance segment related to loans and leases originated by the specialty finance segment and sold or assigned to the community banking segment. Similarly, for purposes of analyzing the contribution from the wealth management segment, management allocates a portion of the net interest income earned by the community banking segment on deposit balances of customers of the wealth management segment to the wealth management segment. See Note (10) &#8220;Deposits&#8221; for more information on these deposits. Finally, expenses incurred at the Wintrust parent company are allocated to each segment based on each segment&#8217;s risk-weighted assets. 

The segment financial information provided in the following tables has been derived from the internal profitability reporting system used by management to monitor and manage the financial performance of the Company. The accounting policies of the segments are substantially similar to those described in Note (1) &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221;. The Company evaluates segment performance based on after-tax profit or loss and other appropriate profitability measures common to each segment.

Potentially dilutive common shares can result from stock options, restricted stock unit awards and shares to be issued under the ESPP and the DDFS Plan, being treated as if they had been either exercised or issued, computed by application of the treasury stock method. While potentially dilutive common shares are typically included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from this computation in periods in which the effect would reduce the loss per share or increase the income per share.
