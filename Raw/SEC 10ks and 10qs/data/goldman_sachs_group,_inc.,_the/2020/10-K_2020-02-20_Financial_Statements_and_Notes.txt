Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the firm), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The firm&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the firm&#8217;s principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the firm&#8217;s financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

As of December 31, 2019, management conducted an assessment of the firm&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has determined that the firm&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 was effective.

Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the firm; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the firm&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

The firm&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on pages 103 and 104, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the firm&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019.

To the Board of Directors and the Shareholders of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.: 

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders&#8217; equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). We also have audited the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions 

The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing on page 102. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Valuation of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments 

As described in Notes 4 through 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company carries financial instruments at fair value, which includes $23.1 billion of financial assets and $25.9 billion of financial liabilities classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as one or more inputs to the financial instrument&#8217;s valuation technique are significant and unobservable. Significant unobservable inputs used by management to value certain of these Level 3 financial instruments included (i) industry multiples and public comparables, (ii) credit spreads 

and (iii) correlation.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of certain Level 3 financial instruments 

is a critical audit matter are (i) the valuation of these certain financial instruments involved the application of significant judgment on the part of management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor subjectivity in performing procedures related to the valuation of these financial instruments, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment and effort to evaluate the audit evidence obtained related to the aforementioned significant unobservable inputs used for these certain Level 3 financial instruments, and (iii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained related to the valuation of these financial instruments. 

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of these financial instruments, including controls over the methods and significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of these financial instruments. 

These procedures also included, among others, for a sample of financial instruments, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent estimate of fair value or testing management&#8217;s process to determine the fair value of these financial instruments. Developing the independent estimate involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management, developing independent significant unobservable inputs, and comparing management&#8217;s estimate to the independently developed estimate of fair value. Testing management&#8217;s process included evaluating the reasonableness of the aforementioned significant unobservable inputs, evaluating the appropriateness of the methods used, and testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management to determine the fair value of these instruments.

Provision for Losses That May Arise from Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings related to 1Malaysia Development Berhad 

As described in Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has received subpoenas and requests for documents and information from various governmental and regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations as part of investigations and reviews relating to financing transactions and other matters involving 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a sovereign wealth fund in Malaysia. Management estimates and provides for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company&#8217;s total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case

basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, proceeding or investigation, management&#8217;s experience and the experience of others in similar cases, proceedings or investigations, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In addition, management includes disclosures relating to the actions, proceedings and inquiries related to 1MDB.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the provision for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings 

related to 1MDB is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment on the part of management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being incurred and in determining a reasonable estimate of the loss, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in evaluating management&#8217;s assessment of the provision for losses and related disclosures.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management&#8217;s estimation of the provision for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings, including controls over determining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as controls over the related financial statement disclosures. 

These procedures also included, among others, obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel, evaluating the reasonableness of management&#8217;s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable, and evaluating the sufficiency of the Company&#8217;s litigation and regulatory proceedings disclosures.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Note 1. 

Description of Business 

The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc. or parent company), a Delaware corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the firm), is a leading global investment banking, securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals. Founded in 1869, the firm is headquartered in New York and maintains offices in all major financial centers around the world. 

Commencing with the fourth quarter of 2019, the firm began reporting its activities in the following four business segments consistent with how the firm&#8217;s activities are now managed: Investment Banking, Global Markets, Asset Management, and Consumer &#38; Wealth Management. Prior periods are presented on a comparable basis. 

Investment Banking 

The firm provides a broad range of investment banking services to a diverse group of corporations, financial institutions, investment funds and governments. Services include strategic advisory assignments with respect to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense activities, restructurings and spin-offs, and equity and debt underwriting of public offerings and private placements. The firm also provides lending to corporate clients, including middle-market lending, relationship lending and acquisition financing. 

Global Markets 

The firm facilitates client transactions and makes markets in fixed income, equity, currency and commodity products with institutional clients, such as corporations, financial institutions, investment funds and governments. The firm also makes markets in and clears institutional client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide and provides prime brokerage and other equities financing activities, including securities lending, margin lending and swaps. The firm also provides financing to clients through repurchase agreements, as well as through structured credit, warehouse and asset-backed lending. 

Asset Management 

The firm manages assets and offers investment products (primarily through separately managed accounts and commingled vehicles, such as mutual funds and private investment funds) across all major asset classes to a diverse set of institutional clients and a network of third-party distributors around the world. The firm makes equity investments, which includes alternative investing activities related to public and private equity investments in corporate, real estate and infrastructure entities, as well as investments through consolidated investment entities, substantially all of which are engaged in real estate investment activities. 

The firm also provides financing related to its asset management businesses, including investments in debt securities and loans backed by real estate. 

Consumer &#38; Wealth Management

The firm provides investing and wealth advisory solutions, including financial planning and counseling, executing brokerage transactions and managing assets for individuals in its wealth management business. The firm also provides loans and accepts deposits through its consumer banking digital platform, Marcus by Goldman Sachs

, 

and through its private bank, as well as issues credit cards to consumers.

Note 2. 

Basis of Presentation 

These consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) and include the accounts of Group Inc. and all other entities in which the firm has a controlling financial interest. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 

All references to 2019, 2018 and 2017 refer to the firm&#8217;s years ended, or the dates, as the context requires, December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Any reference to a future year refers to a year ending on December 31 of that year.

Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019 and concurrent with the changes to business segments, the firm changed its balance sheet presentation to better reflect the nature of the firm&#8217;s activities. The primary changes include the elimination of the financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold, but not yet purchased line items, the introduction of new line items for trading assets, trading liabilities and investments ,

and the inclusion of all non-trading loans in the loans line item, reclassifying the related cash flows, where applicable. Investments and loans generally include positions held for longer-term purposes, while trading assets and liabilities generally include positions held for market-making or risk management activities. In addition, revenues from transactions in derivatives related to client advisory and underwriting assignments, previously reported in investment banking, are now reported in market making within the consolidated statements of earnings.

Reclassifications have been made to previously reported amounts to conform to the current presentation.

Consolidation 

The firm consolidates entities in which the firm has a controlling financial interest. The firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity (VIE). 

Voting Interest Entities.

Voting interest entities are entities in which (i) the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities independently and (ii) the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If the firm has a controlling majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity is consolidated.

Variable Interest Entities.

A VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. The firm has a controlling financial interest in a VIE when the firm has a variable interest or interests that provide it with (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE&#8217;s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for further information about VIEs.

Equity-Method Investments.

When the firm does not have a controlling financial interest in an entity but can exert significant influence over the entity&#8217;s operating and financial policies, the investment is generally accounted for at fair value by electing the fair value option available under U.S. GAAP. Significant influence generally exists when the firm owns 20% to 50% of the entity&#8217;s common stock or in-substance

common stock.

In certain cases, the firm applies the equity method of accounting to new investments that are strategic in nature or closely related to the firm&#8217;s principal business activities, when the firm has a significant degree of involvement in the cash flows or operations of the investee or when cost-benefit considerations are less significant. See Note 8 for further information about equity-method investments.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Investment Funds.

The firm has formed investment funds with third-party investors. These funds are typically organized as limited partnerships or limited liability companies for which the firm acts as general partner or manager. Generally, the firm does not hold a majority of the economic interests in these funds. These funds are usually voting interest entities and generally are not consolidated because third-party investors typically have rights to terminate the funds or to remove the firm as general partner or manager. Investments in these funds are generally measured at net asset value (NAV) and are included in investments. See Notes 8, 18 and 22 for further information about investments in funds.

Use of Estimates 

Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions, the most important of which relate to fair value measurements, the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost, accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and provisions for losses that may arise from tax audits. These estimates and assumptions are based on the best available information but actual results could be materially different. 

Revenue Recognition 

Financial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value.

Trading assets and liabilities and certain investments are recorded at fair value either under the fair value option or in accordance with other U.S. GAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to account for certain of its loans and other financial assets and liabilities at fair value by electing the fair value option. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. Fair value gains or losses are generally included 

in market making or other principal transactions. See Note 4 for further information about fair value measurements.

Revenue from Contracts with Clients.

The firm accounts for revenue earned from contracts with clients for services, such as investment banking, investment management, and execution and clearing (contracts with clients), under ASU No. 2014-09,

&#8220;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).&#8221; As such, revenues for these services are recognized when the performance obligations related to the underlying transaction are completed.

Revenues from contracts with clients subject to this ASU represent approximately 45 % of total non-interest

revenues for 2019 (including approximately 85 % of investment banking revenues, approximately 95 % of investment management revenues and all commissions and fees), and approximately 50 % of total non-interest

revenues for 2018 (including approximately 85 % of investment banking revenues, approximately 95 % of investment management revenues and all commissions and fees for 2018). Net interest income is not subject to this ASU. See Note 25 for information about net revenues by business segment.

Investment Banking 

Advisory.

Fees from financial advisory assignments are recognized in revenues when the services related to the underlying transaction are completed under the terms of the assignment. Non-refundable

deposits and milestone payments in connection with financial advisory assignments are recognized in revenues upon completion of the underlying transaction or when the assignment is otherwise concluded.

Expenses associated with financial advisory assignments are recognized when incurred and are included in other expenses. Client reimbursements for such expenses are included in investment banking revenues. 

Underwriting.

Fees from underwriting assignments are recognized in revenues upon completion of the underlying transaction based on the terms of the assignment.

Expenses associated with underwriting assignments are generally deferred until the related revenue is recognized or the assignment is otherwise concluded. Such expenses are included in other expenses. 

Investment Management 

The firm earns management fees and incentive fees for investment management services, which are included in investment management revenues. The firm makes payments to brokers and advisors related to the placement of the firm&#8217;s investment funds (distribution fees), which are included in brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees. 

Management Fees.

Management fees for mutual funds are calculated as a percentage of daily net asset value and are received monthly. Management fees for hedge funds and separately managed accounts are calculated as a percentage of month-end

net asset value and are generally received quarterly. Management fees for private equity funds are calculated as a percentage of monthly invested capital or committed capital and are received quarterly, semi-annually or annually, depending on the fund. Management fees are recognized over time in the period the services are provided.

Distribution fees paid by the firm are calculated based on either a percentage of the management fee, the investment fund&#8217;s net asset value or the committed capital. Such fees are included in brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees. 

##TABLE_START Goldman Sachs 2019 Form 10-K 

&#160; 111

##TABLE_END 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Incentive Fees.

Incentive fees are calculated as a percentage of a fund&#8217;s or separately managed account&#8217;s return, or excess return above a specified benchmark or other performance target. Incentive fees are generally based on investment performance over a twelve-month period or over the life of a fund. Fees that are based on performance over a twelve-month period are subject to adjustment prior to the end of the measurement period. For fees that are based on investment performance over the life of the fund, future investment underperformance may require fees previously distributed to the firm to be returned to the fund.

Incentive fees earned from a fund or separately managed account are recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur, which is generally when such fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the market value of investments held by the fund or separately managed account. Therefore, incentive fees recognized during the period may relate to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods. 

Commissions and Fees 

The firm earns commissions and fees from executing and clearing client transactions on stock, options and futures markets, as well as over-the-counter

(OTC) transactions. Commissions and fees are recognized on the day the trade is executed. The firm also provides third-party research services to clients in connection with certain soft-dollar arrangements. Third-party research costs incurred by the firm in connection with such arrangements are presented net within commissions and fees.

Remaining Performance Obligations 

Remaining performance obligations are services that the firm has committed to perform in the future in connection with its contracts with clients. The firm&#8217;s remaining performance obligations are generally related to its financial advisory assignments and certain investment management activities. Revenues associated with remaining performance obligations relating to financial advisory assignments cannot be determined until the outcome of the transaction. For the firm&#8217;s investment management activities, where fees are calculated based on the net asset value of the fund or separately managed account, future revenues associated with such remaining performance obligations cannot be determined as such fees are subject to fluctuations in the market value of investments held by the fund or separately managed account. 

The firm is able to determine the future revenues associated with management fees calculated based on committed capital. As of December 2019, substantially all future net revenues associated with such remaining performance obligations will be recognized through 2026. Annual revenues associated with such performance obligations average less than $ 250 million through 2026. 

Transfers of Financial Assets 

Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when the firm has relinquished control over the assets transferred. For transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales, any gains or losses are recognized in net revenues. Assets or liabilities that arise from the firm&#8217;s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets are initially recognized at fair value. For transfers of financial assets that are not accounted for as sales, the assets are generally included in trading assets and the transfer is accounted for as a collateralized financing, with the related interest expense recognized over the life of the transaction. See Note 11 for further information about transfers of financial assets accounted for as collateralized financings and Note 16 for further information about transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The firm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid overnight deposits held in the ordinary course of business. Cash and cash equivalents included cash and due from banks of $ 12.57 billion as of December 2019 and $ 10.66 billion as of December 2018. Cash and cash equivalents also included interest-bearing deposits with banks of $ 120.98 billion as of December 2019 and $ 119.89 billion as of December 2018. 

The firm segregates cash for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity. Cash and cash equivalents segregated for regulatory and other purposes were $ 22.78 billion as of December 2019 and $ 23.14 billion as of December 2018. In addition, the firm segregates securities for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity. See Note 11 for further information about segregated securities. 

Customer and Other Receivables 

Customer and other receivables included receivables from customers and counterparties of $ 50.90 billion as of December 2019 and $ 46.95 billion as of December 2018, and receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations of $ 23.71 billion as of December 2019 and $ 25.50 billion as of December 2018. Such receivables primarily consist of customer margin loans, receivables resulting from unsettled transactions and collateral posted in connection with certain derivative transactions. 

Substantially all of these receivables are accounted for at amortized cost net of estimated uncollectible amounts, which generally approximates fair value. As these receivables are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these receivables been included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2019 and December 2018. See Note 10 for further information about customer and other receivables accounted for at fair value under the fair value option. Interest on customer and other receivables is recognized over the life of the transaction and included in interest income.

##TABLE_END 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Customer and other receivables includes receivables from contracts with clients and contract assets. Contract assets represent the firm&#8217;s right to receive consideration for services provided in connection with its contracts with clients for which collection is conditional and not merely subject to the passage of time. The firm&#8217;s receivables from contracts with clients were $ 2.27 billion as of December 2019 and $ 1.94 billion as of December 2018. As of both December 2019 and December 2018 contract assets were not material. 

Customer and Other Payables 

Customer and other payables included payables to customers and counterparties of $ 170.21 billion as of December 2019 and $ 173.99 billion as of December 2018, and payables to brokers, dealers and clearing organizations of $ 4.61 billion as of December 2019 and $ 6.24 billion as of December 2018. Such payables primarily consist of customer credit balances related to the firm&#8217;s prime brokerage activities. Customer and other payables are accounted for at cost plus accrued interest, which generally approximates fair value. As these payables are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these payables been included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2019 and December 2018. Interest on customer and other payables is recognized over the life of the transaction and included in interest expense. 

Offsetting Assets and Liabilities 

To reduce credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, the firm may enter into master netting agreements or similar arrangements (collectively, netting agreements) with counterparties that permit it to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. A netting agreement is a contract with a counterparty that permits net settlement of multiple transactions with that counterparty, including upon the exercise of termination rights by a non-defaulting

party. Upon exercise of such termination rights, all transactions governed by the netting agreement are terminated and a net settlement amount is calculated. In addition, the firm receives and posts cash and securities collateral with respect to its derivatives and securities financing transactions, subject to the terms of the related credit support agreements or similar arrangements (collectively, credit support agreements). An enforceable credit support agreement grants the non-defaulting

party exercising termination rights the right to liquidate the collateral and apply the proceeds to any amounts owed. In order to assess enforceability of the firm&#8217;s right of setoff under netting and credit support agreements, the firm evaluates various factors, including applicable bankruptcy laws, local statutes and regulatory provisions in the jurisdiction of the parties to the agreement.

Derivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty

basis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) in the consolidated balance sheets when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement. Securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements) and securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) and securities borrowed and loaned transactions with the same term and currency are presented on a net-by-counterparty

basis in the consolidated balance sheets when such transactions meet certain settlement criteria and are subject to netting agreements.

In the consolidated balance sheets, derivatives are reported net of cash collateral received and posted under enforceable credit support agreements, when transacted under an enforceable netting agreement. In the consolidated balance sheets, resale and repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed and loaned, are not reported net of the related cash and securities received or posted as collateral. See Note 11 for further information about collateral received and pledged, including rights to deliver or repledge collateral. See Notes 7 and 11 for further information about offsetting assets and liabilities. 

Foreign Currency Translation 

Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S.

currencies are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the consolidated balance sheets and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange for the period. Foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses on transactions in nonfunctional currencies are recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on translation of the financial statements of a non-U.S.

operation, when the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are included, net of hedges and taxes, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

Recent Accounting Developments 

Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606).

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09.

This ASU, as amended, provides comprehensive guidance on the recognition of revenue earned from contracts with customers arising from the transfer of goods and services, guidance on accounting for certain contract costs and new disclosures.

The firm adopted this ASU in January 2018 under a modified retrospective approach. As a result of adopting this ASU, the firm, among other things, delays recognition of non-refundable

and milestone payments on financial advisory assignments until the assignments are completed, and recognizes certain investment management fees earlier than under the firm&#8217;s previous revenue recognition policies. The cumulative effect of adopting this ASU as of January 1, 2018 was a decrease to retained earnings of $ 53 million (net of tax).

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

The firm also prospectively changed the presentation of certain costs from a net presentation within revenues to a gross basis, and vice versa. Beginning in 2018, certain underwriting expenses, which were netted against investment banking revenues, and certain distribution fees, which were netted against investment management revenues, are presented gross as operating expenses. Costs incurred in connection with certain soft-dollar arrangements, which were presented gross as operating expenses, are presented net within commissions and fees. 

Leases (ASC 842).

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,

&#8220;Leases (Topic 842).&#8221; This ASU requires that, for leases longer than one year, a lessee recognize in the balance sheet a right-of-use

asset, representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability, representing the liability to make lease payments. It also requires that for finance leases, a lessee recognize interest expense on the lease liability, separately from the amortization of the right-of-use

asset in the statements of earnings, while for operating leases, such amounts should be recognized as a combined expense. It also requires that for qualifying sale-leaseback transactions the seller recognize any gain or loss (based on the estimated fair value of the asset at the time of sale) when control of the asset is transferred instead of amortizing it over the lease period. In addition, this ASU requires expanded disclosures about the nature and terms of lease agreements.

The firm adopted this ASU in January 2019 under a modified retrospective approach. Upon adoption, in accordance with the ASU, the firm elected to not reassess the lease classification or initial direct costs of existing leases, and to not reassess whether existing contracts contain a lease. In addition, the firm has elected to account for each contract&#8217;s lease and non-lease

components as a single lease component. The impact of adoption was a gross up of $ 1.77 billion on the firm&#8217;s consolidated balance sheet and an increase to retained earnings of $ 12 million (net of tax) as of January 1, 2019.

Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASC 326). 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,

&#8220;Financial Instruments &#8212; Credit Losses (Topic 326) &#8212; Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.&#8221; This ASU amends several aspects of the measurement of credit losses on certain financial instruments, including replacing the existing incurred credit loss model and other models with the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) model and amending certain aspects of accounting for purchased financial assets with deterioration in credit quality since origination (Purchased Credit Deteriorated or PCD loans).

The firm adopted this ASU in January 2020 under a modified retrospective approach. As a result of adopting this ASU, the firm&#8217;s allowance for credit losses on financial assets and commitments that are measured at amortized cost will reflect management&#8217;s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such assets. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets and commitments, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, will be recognized in earnings. These expected credit losses will be measured based on historical experience, current conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. 

The cumulative effect of measuring the allowance under CECL as a result of adopting this ASU as of January 1, 2020 was an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $ 848 million. The increase in the allowance is driven by the fact that the allowance under CECL covers expected credit losses over the full expected life of the loan portfolios and also takes into account forecasts of expected future economic conditions. In addition, in accordance with the ASU, the firm elected the fair value option for loans that were previously accounted for as Purchased Credit Impaired (PCI), which resulted in a decrease to the allowance for PCI loans of $ 169 million. The cumulative effect of adopting this ASU was a decrease to retained earnings of approximately

$ 640 million (net of tax). 

Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASC 220).

In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02,

&#8220;Income Statement &#8212; Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) &#8212; Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.&#8221; This ASU permits a reporting entity to reclassify the income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation) on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings.

The firm adopted this ASU in January 2019 and did not elect to reclassify the income tax effects of Tax Legislation from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. Therefore, the adoption of the ASU did not have an impact on the firm&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.

Note 4. 

Fair Value Measurements 

The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. The firm measures certain financial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks). 

The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an active market. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is determined by reference to prices for similar instruments, quoted prices or recent transactions in less active markets, or internally developed models that primarily use market-based or independently sourced inputs, including, but not limited to, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, credit spreads and funding spreads (i.e., the spread or difference between the interest rate at which a borrower could finance a given financial instrument relative to a benchmark interest rate). 

U.S. GAAP has a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. This hierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value, giving the highest priority to level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial instrument&#8217;s level in this hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to its fair value measurement. In evaluating the significance of a valuation input, the firm considers, among other factors, a portfolio&#8217;s net risk exposure to that input. The fair value hierarchy is as follows: 

Level 1.

Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets to which the firm had access at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.

Level 2.

Inputs to valuation techniques are observable, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3.

One or more inputs to valuation techniques are significant and unobservable.

The fair values for substantially all of the firm&#8217;s financial assets and liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets and liabilities may require valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors, such as counterparty and the firm&#8217;s credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence. 

The valuation techniques and nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the firm&#8217;s financial instruments are described below. See Notes 5 through 10 for further information about significant unobservable inputs used to value level 3 financial instruments. 

Valuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Trading Cash Instruments, Investments and Loans 

Level 1.

Level 1 instruments include U.S. government obligations, most non-U.S.

government obligations, certain agency obligations, certain corporate debt instruments, certain other debt obligations and actively traded listed equities. These instruments are valued using quoted prices for identical unrestricted instruments in active markets. The firm defines active markets for equity instruments based on the average daily trading volume both in absolute terms and relative to the market capitalization for the instrument. The firm defines active markets for debt instruments based on both the average daily trading volume and the number of days with trading activity. 

Level 2.

Level 2 instruments include certain non-U.S. 

government obligations, most agency obligations, most mortgage-backed loans and securities, most corporate debt instruments, most state and municipal obligations, most other debt obligations, restricted or less liquid listed equities, certain private equities, commodities and certain lending commitments.

Valuations of level 2 instruments can be verified to quoted prices, recent trading activity for identical or similar instruments, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or firm) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources. 

Valuation adjustments are typically made to level 2 instruments (i) if the instrument is subject to transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other premiums and liquidity discounts that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value. Valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Level 3.

Level 3 instruments have one or more significant valuation inputs that are not observable. Absent evidence to the contrary, level 3 instruments are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequently, the firm uses other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Valuation inputs and assumptions are changed when corroborated by substantive observable evidence, including values realized on sales.

Valuation techniques of level 3 instruments vary by instrument, but are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques. The valuation techniques and the nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair values of each type of level 3 instrument are described below: 

Loans and Securities Backed by Commercial Real Estate 

Loans and securities backed by commercial real estate are directly or indirectly collateralized by a single property or a portfolio of properties, and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. Significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses and include: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets and/or current levels and changes in market indices, such as the CMBX (an index that tracks the performance of commercial mortgage bonds); ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Transaction prices in both the underlying collateral and instruments with the same or similar underlying collateral; ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

A measure of expected future cash flows in a default scenario (recovery rates) implied by the value of the underlying collateral, which is mainly driven by current performance of the underlying collateral and capitalization rates. Recovery rates are expressed as a percentage of notional or face value of the instrument and reflect the benefit of credit enhancements on certain instruments; and ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Timing of expected future cash flows (duration) which, in certain cases, may incorporate the impact of other unobservable inputs (e.g., prepayment speeds). ##TABLE_END 

Loans and Securities Backed by Residential Real Estate 

Loans and securities backed by residential real estate are directly or indirectly collateralized by portfolios of residential real estate and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. Significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons to instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles. Significant inputs include: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Duration, driven by underlying loan prepayment speeds and residential property liquidation timelines. ##TABLE_END 

Corporate Debt Instruments 

Corporate debt instruments includes corporate loans, debt securities and convertible debentures. Significant inputs for corporate debt instruments are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons both to prices of credit default swaps that reference the same or similar underlying instrument or entity and to other debt instruments for the same or similar issuer for which observable prices or broker quotations are available. Significant inputs include: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets and/or current levels and trends of market indices, such as the CDX (an index that tracks the performance of corporate credit); ##TABLE_END

Equity Securities 

Equity securities consists of private equities. Recent third-party completed or pending transactions (e.g., merger proposals, debt restructurings, tender offers) are considered the best evidence for any change in fair value. When these are not available, the following valuation methodologies are used, as appropriate: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Industry multiples (primarily EBITDA and revenue multiples) and public comparables; ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

Other Trading Cash Instruments, Investments and Loans 

The significant inputs to the valuation of other instruments, such as U.S. and non-U.S.

government and agency obligations, state and municipal obligations, and other loans and debt obligations are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons both to prices of credit default swaps that reference the same or similar underlying instrument or entity and to other debt instruments for the same issuer for which observable prices or broker quotations are available.

Valuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Derivatives 

The firm&#8217;s level 2 and level 3 derivatives are valued using derivative pricing models (e.g., discounted cash flow models, correlation models, and models that incorporate option pricing methodologies, such as Monte Carlo simulations). Price transparency of derivatives can generally be characterized by product type, as described below. 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Interest Rate.

In general, the key inputs used to value interest rate derivatives are transparent, even for most long-dated contracts. Interest rate swaps and options denominated in the currencies of leading industrialized nations are characterized by high trading volumes and tight bid/offer spreads. Interest rate derivatives that reference indices, such as an inflation index, or the shape of the yield curve (e.g., 10-year

swap rate vs. 2-year

swap rate) are more complex, but the key inputs are generally observable. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Credit.

Price transparency for credit default swaps, including both single names and baskets of credits, varies by market and underlying reference entity or obligation. Credit default swaps that reference indices, large corporates and major sovereigns generally exhibit the most price transparency. For credit default swaps with other underliers, price transparency varies based on credit rating, the cost of borrowing the underlying reference obligations, and the availability of the underlying reference obligations for delivery upon the default of the issuer. Credit default swaps that reference loans, asset-backed securities and emerging market debt instruments tend to have less price transparency than those that reference corporate bonds. In addition, more complex credit derivatives, such as those sensitive to the correlation between two or more underlying reference obligations, generally have less price transparency. ##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Currency.

Prices for currency derivatives based on the exchange rates of leading industrialized nations, including those with longer tenors, are generally transparent. The primary difference between the price transparency of developed and emerging market currency derivatives is that emerging markets tend to be only observable for contracts with shorter tenors. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Commodity.

Commodity derivatives include transactions referenced to energy (e.g., oil and natural gas), metals (e.g., precious and base) and soft commodities (e.g., agricultural). Price transparency varies based on the underlying commodity, delivery location, tenor and product quality (e.g., diesel fuel compared to unleaded gasoline). In general, price transparency for commodity derivatives is greater for contracts with shorter tenors and contracts that are more closely aligned with major and/or benchmark commodity indices. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Equity.

Price transparency for equity derivatives varies by market and underlier. Options on indices and the common stock of corporates included in major equity indices exhibit the most price transparency. Equity derivatives generally have observable market prices, except for contracts with long tenors or reference prices that differ significantly from current market prices. More complex equity derivatives, such as those sensitive to the correlation between two or more individual stocks, generally have less price transparency. ##TABLE_END 

Liquidity is essential to observability of all product types. If transaction volumes decline, previously transparent prices and other inputs may become unobservable. Conversely, even highly structured products may at times have trading volumes large enough to provide observability of prices and other inputs. 

Level 1.

Level 1 derivatives include short-term contracts for future delivery of securities when the underlying security is a level 1 instrument, and exchange-traded derivatives if they are actively traded and are valued at their quoted market price.

Level 2.

Level 2 derivatives include OTC derivatives for which all significant valuation inputs are corroborated by market evidence and exchange-traded derivatives that are not actively traded and/or that are valued using models that calibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC derivatives.

The selection of a particular model to value a derivative depends on the contractual terms of and specific risks inherent in the instrument, as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. For derivatives that trade in liquid markets, model selection does not involve significant management judgment because outputs of models can be calibrated to market-clearing levels. 

##TABLE_START Goldman Sachs 2019 Form 10-K 

&#160; 117

##TABLE_END 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Valuation models require a variety of inputs, such as contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, discount rates (including those derived from interest rates on collateral received and posted as specified in credit support agreements for collateralized derivatives), credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates, loss severity rates and correlations of such inputs. Significant inputs to the valuations of level 2 derivatives can be verified to market transactions, broker or dealer quotations or other alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or firm) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources. 

Level 3.

Level 3 derivatives are valued using models which utilize observable level 1 and/or level 2 inputs, as well as unobservable level 3 inputs. The significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm&#8217;s level 3 derivatives are described below.

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

For level 3 interest rate and currency derivatives, significant unobservable inputs include correlations of certain currencies and interest rates (e.g., the correlation between Euro inflation and Euro interest rates). In addition, for level 3 interest rate derivatives, significant unobservable inputs include specific interest rate volatilities. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

For level 3 credit derivatives, significant unobservable inputs include illiquid credit spreads and upfront credit points, which are unique to specific reference obligations and reference entities, recovery rates and certain correlations required to value credit derivatives (e.g., the likelihood of default of the underlying reference obligation relative to one another). ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

For level 3 commodity derivatives, significant unobservable inputs include volatilities for options with strike prices that differ significantly from current market prices and prices or spreads for certain products for which the product quality or physical location of the commodity is not aligned with benchmark indices. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

For level 3 equity derivatives, significant unobservable inputs generally include equity volatility inputs for options that are long-dated and/or have strike prices that differ significantly from current market prices. In addition, the valuation of certain structured trades requires the use of level 3 correlation inputs, such as the correlation of the price performance of two or more individual stocks or the correlation of the price performance for a basket of stocks to another asset class, such as commodities. ##TABLE_END 

Subsequent to the initial valuation of a level 3 derivative, the firm updates the level 1 and level 2 inputs to reflect observable market changes and any resulting gains and losses are classified in level 3. Level 3 inputs are changed when corroborated by evidence, such as similar market transactions, third-party pricing services and/or broker or dealer quotations or other empirical market data. In circumstances where the firm cannot verify the model value by reference to market transactions, it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate of fair value. See Note 7 for further information about significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of level 3 derivatives. 

Valuation Adjustments.

Valuation adjustments are integral to determining the fair value of derivative portfolios and are used to adjust the mid-market

valuations produced by derivative pricing models to the exit price valuation. These adjustments incorporate bid/offer spreads, the cost of liquidity, credit valuation adjustments and funding valuation adjustments, which account for the credit and funding risk inherent in the uncollateralized portion of derivative portfolios. The firm also makes funding valuation adjustments to collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit the firm to deliver or repledge collateral received. Market-based inputs are generally used when calibrating valuation adjustments to market-clearing levels.

In addition, for derivatives that include significant unobservable inputs, the firm makes model or exit price adjustments to account for the valuation uncertainty present in the transaction. 

Valuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Other Financial Instruments at Fair Value 

In addition to trading cash instruments, derivatives, and certain investments and loans, the firm accounts for certain of its other financial assets and liabilities at fair value under the fair value option. Such instruments include repurchase agreements and substantially all resale agreements; securities borrowed and loaned in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) financing; certain customer and other receivables, including certain margin loans; certain time deposits, including structured certificates of deposit, which are hybrid financial instruments; substantially all other secured financings, including transfers of assets accounted for as financings; certain unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, substantially all of which are hybrid financial instruments; and other liabilities. These instruments are generally valued based on discounted cash flow techniques, which incorporate inputs with reasonable levels of price transparency, and are generally classified in level 2 because the inputs are observable. Valuation adjustments may be made for liquidity and for counterparty and the firm&#8217;s credit quality. The significant inputs used to value the firm&#8217;s other financial instruments are described below.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Resale and Repurchase Agreements and Securities Borrowed and Loaned.

The significant inputs to the valuation of resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and loaned are funding spreads, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and interest rates.

Customer and Other Receivables.

The significant inputs to the valuation of receivables are interest rates, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and funding spreads.

Deposits.

The significant inputs to the valuation of time deposits are interest rates and the amount and timing of future cash flows. The inputs used to value the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial instruments are consistent with the inputs used to value the firm&#8217;s other derivative instruments described above. See Note 7 for further information about derivatives and Note 13 for further information about deposits.

Other Secured Financings.

The significant inputs to the valuation of other secured financings are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, interest rates, funding spreads, the fair value of the collateral delivered by the firm (determined using the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, market prices, market yields and recovery assumptions) and the frequency of additional collateral calls. See Note 11 for further information about collateralized agreements and financings.

Unsecured Short- and Long-Term Borrowings.

The significant inputs to the valuation of unsecured short- and long-term borrowings are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, interest rates, the credit spreads of the firm and commodity prices for prepaid commodity transactions. The inputs used to value the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial instruments are consistent with the inputs used to value the firm&#8217;s other derivative instruments described above. See Note 7 for further information about derivatives and Note 14 for further information about borrowings.

Other Liabilities.

The significant inputs to the valuation of other liabilities are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and equity volatility and correlation inputs.

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Gains and losses included in market making are primarily related to the firm&#8217;s trading assets and liabilities, including both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments. Gains/(losses) are not representative of the manner in which the firm manages its business activities because many of the firm&#8217;s market-making and client facilitation strategies utilize financial instruments across various product types. Accordingly, gains or losses in one product type frequently offset gains or losses in other product types. For example, most of the firm&#8217;s longer-term derivatives across product types are sensitive to changes in interest rates and may be economically hedged with interest rate swaps. Similarly, a significant portion of the firm&#8217;s trading cash instruments and derivatives across product types has exposure to foreign currencies and may be economically hedged with foreign currency contracts. ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#8226;

The ranges and weighted averages of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one trading cash instrument. For example, the highest recovery rate for corporate debt instruments is appropriate for valuing a specific corporate debt instrument, but may not be appropriate for valuing any other corporate debt instrument. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 trading cash instruments. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Increases in yield, duration or cumulative loss rate used in the valuation of level 3 trading cash instruments would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement, while increases in recovery rate would have resulted in a higher fair value measurement as of both December 2019 and December 2018. Due to the distinctive nature of each level 3 trading cash instrument, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type. ##TABLE_END

Level 3 Rollforward Commentary 

Year Ended December 2019.

The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 trading cash instrument assets of $ 54 million (reflecting $ 89 million of net realized gains and $ 35 million of net unrealized losses) for 2019 included gains/(losses) of $( 56 ) million reported in market making and $ 110 million reported in interest income.

The drivers of net unrealized losses on level 3 trading cash instrument assets for 2019 were not material. 

Transfers into level 3 trading cash instrument assets during 2019 primarily reflected transfers of certain corporate debt instruments from level 2, principally due to reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence, including fewer market transactions in these instruments. 

The drivers of transfers out of level 3 trading cash instrument assets during 2019 were not material. 

Year Ended December 2018.

The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 trading cash instrument assets of $ 99 million (reflecting $ 188 million of net realized gains and $ 89 million of net unrealized losses) for 2018 included gains/(losses) of $( 87 ) million reported in market making and $ 186 million reported in interest income.

The drivers of net unrealized losses on level 3 trading cash instrument assets for 2018 were not material.

Note 7. 

Derivatives and Hedging Activities 

Derivative Activities 

Derivatives are instruments that derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates and other inputs, or a combination of these factors. Derivatives may be traded on an exchange (exchange-traded) or they may be privately negotiated contracts, which are usually referred to as OTC derivatives. Certain of the firm&#8217;s OTC derivatives are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties (OTC-cleared),

while others are bilateral contracts between two counterparties (bilateral OTC).

Market Making.

As a market maker, the firm enters into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. In this role, the firm typically acts as principal and is required to commit capital to provide execution, and maintains market-making positions in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand.

Risk Management.

The firm also enters into derivatives to actively manage risk exposures that arise from its market-making and investing and financing activities. The firm&#8217;s holdings and exposures are hedged, in many cases, on either a portfolio or risk-specific basis, as opposed to an instrument-by-instrument

basis. The offsetting impact of this economic hedging is reflected in the same business segment as the related revenues. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives designated as hedges under U.S. GAAP. These derivatives are used to manage interest rate exposure in certain fixed-rate unsecured long-term and short-term borrowings, and deposits, and to manage foreign currency exposure on the net investment in certain non-U.S.

operations.

The firm enters into various types of derivatives, including: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Futures and Forwards.

Contracts that commit counterparties to purchase or sell financial instruments, commodities or currencies in the future. ##TABLE_END &#160;

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Swaps.

Contracts that require counterparties to exchange cash flows, such as currency or interest payment streams. The amounts exchanged are based on the specific terms of the contract with reference to specified rates, financial instruments, commodities, currencies or indices. ##TABLE_END &#160;

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Options.

Contracts in which the option purchaser has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from or sell to the option writer financial instruments, commodities or currencies within a defined time period for a specified price. ##TABLE_END &#160;

Derivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty

basis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement (counterparty netting). Derivatives are accounted for at fair value, net of cash collateral received or posted under enforceable credit support agreements (cash collateral netting). Derivative assets are included in trading assets and derivative liabilities are included in trading liabilities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges are included in market making (for derivatives included in the Global Markets segment), and other principal transactions (for derivatives included in the remaining business segments) in the consolidated statements of earnings. For the years ended December 2019 and December 2018, substantially all of the firm&#8217;s derivatives were included in the Global Markets segment.

In the tables above: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Gross fair values exclude the effects of both counterparty netting 

and collateral, and therefore are not representative of the firm&#8217;s exposure. ##TABLE_END &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Where the firm has received or posted collateral under credit support agreements, but has not yet determined such agreements are enforceable, the related collateral has not been netted. ##TABLE_END &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Notional amounts, which represent the sum of gross long and short derivative contracts, provide an indication of the volume of the firm&#8217;s derivative activity and do not represent anticipated losses. ##TABLE_END &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Total gross fair value of derivatives included derivative assets of $ 9.15 billion as of December 2019 and $ 10.68 billion as of December 2018, and derivative liabilities of $ 14.88 billion as of December 2019 and $ 14.58 billion as of December 2018, which are not subject to an enforceable netting agreement or are subject to a netting agreement that the firm has not yet determined to be enforceable. ##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

The ranges, averages and medians of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one derivative. For example, the highest correlation for interest rate derivatives is appropriate for valuing a specific interest rate derivative but may not be appropriate for valuing any other interest rate derivative. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 derivatives. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Interest rates, currencies and equities derivatives are valued using option pricing models, credit derivatives are valued using option pricing, correlation and discounted cash flow models, and commodities derivatives are valued using option pricing and discounted cash flow models. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

The fair value of any one instrument may be determined using multiple valuation techniques. For example, option pricing models and discounted cash flows models are typically used together to determine fair value. Therefore, the level 3 balance encompasses both of these techniques. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Correlation within currencies and equities includes cross-product type correlation. ##TABLE_END

Range of Significant Unobservable Inputs 

The following is information about the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm&#8217;s level 3 derivative instruments: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Correlation.

Ranges for correlation cover a variety of underliers both within one product type (e.g., equity index and equity single stock names) and across product types (e.g., correlation of an interest rate and a currency), as well as across regions. Generally, cross-product type correlation inputs are used to value more complex instruments and are lower than correlation inputs on assets within the same derivative product type. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Volatility.

Ranges for volatility cover numerous underliers across a variety of markets, maturities and strike prices. For example, volatility of equity indices is generally lower than volatility of single stocks. ##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates.

The ranges for credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates cover a variety of underliers (index and single names), regions, sectors, maturities and credit qualities (high-yield and investment-grade). The broad range of this population gives rise to the width of the ranges of significant unobservable inputs. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Commodity prices and spreads.

The ranges for commodity prices and spreads cover variability in products, maturities and delivery locations. ##TABLE_END 

Sensitivity of Fair Value Measurement to Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs 

The following is a description of the directional sensitivity of the firm&#8217;s level 3 fair value measurements to changes in significant unobservable inputs, in isolation, as of each period-end: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Correlation.

In general, for contracts where the holder benefits from the convergence of the underlying asset or index prices (e.g., interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, inflation rates and equity prices), an increase in correlation results in a higher fair value measurement. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Volatility.

In general, for purchased options, an increase in volatility results in a higher fair value measurement. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates.

In general, the fair value of purchased credit protection increases as credit spreads or upfront credit points increase or recovery rates decrease. Credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates are strongly related to distinctive risk factors of the underlying reference obligations, which include reference entity-specific factors, such as leverage, volatility and industry, market-based risk factors, such as borrowing costs or liquidity of the underlying reference obligation, and macroeconomic conditions. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Commodity prices and spreads.

In general, for contracts where the holder is receiving a commodity, an increase in the spread (price difference from a benchmark index due to differences in quality or delivery location) or price results in a higher fair value measurement. ##TABLE_END 

Due to the distinctive nature of each of the firm&#8217;s level 3 derivatives, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type.

##TABLE_START &#8226;

If there is one significant level 3 input, the entire gain or loss from adjusting only observable inputs (i.e., level 1 and level 2 inputs) is classified in level 3. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Gains or losses that have been classified in level 3 resulting from changes in level 1 or level 2 inputs are frequently offset by gains or losses attributable to level 1 or level 2 derivatives and/or level 1, level 2 and level 3 trading cash instruments. As a result, gains/(losses) included in the level 3 rollforward below do not necessarily represent the overall impact on the firm&#8217;s results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. ##TABLE_END 

The table below presents information, by product type, for derivatives included in the summary table above.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Level 3 Rollforward Commentary 

Year Ended December 2019.

The net realized and unrealized losses on level 3 derivatives of $ 336 million (reflecting $ 118 million of net realized gains and $ 454 million of net unrealized losses) for 2019 included losses of $ 305 million reported in market making and $ 31 million reported in other principal transactions.

The net unrealized losses on level 3 derivatives for 2019 were primarily attributable to losses on certain equity derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in equity prices), losses on certain currency derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of a decrease in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates), partially offset by gains on certain credit derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of a decrease in interest rates), gains on certain commodity derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of changes in commodity prices), and gains on certain interest rate derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of a decrease in interest rates). 

The drivers of transfers into level 3 derivatives during 2019 were not material. 

Transfers out of level 3 derivatives during 2019 primarily reflected transfers of certain equity derivative assets to level 2, principally due to certain unobservable inputs no longer being significant to the valuation of these derivatives. 

Year Ended December 2018.

The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 derivatives of $ 1.14 billion (reflecting $ 113 million of net realized losses and $ 1.25 billion of net unrealized gains) for 2018 included gains of $ 1.11 billion reported in market making and $ 28 million reported in other principal transactions.

The net unrealized gains on level 3 derivatives for 2018 were primarily attributable to gains on certain equity derivatives (reflecting the impact of a decrease in certain equity prices) and gains on certain currency derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates). 

Both transfers into level 3 derivatives and transfers out of level 3 derivatives during 2018 were not material.

Credit Derivatives 

The firm enters into a broad array of credit derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage the credit risk associated with market-making and investing and financing activities. Credit derivatives are actively managed based on the firm&#8217;s net risk position. Credit derivatives are generally individually negotiated contracts and can have various settlement and payment conventions. Credit events include failure to pay, bankruptcy, acceleration of indebtedness, restructuring, repudiation and dissolution of the reference entity. 

The firm enters into the following types of credit derivatives: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Credit Default Swaps.

Single-name credit default swaps protect the buyer against the loss of principal on one or more bonds, loans or mortgages (reference obligations) in the event the issuer of the reference obligations suffers a credit event. The buyer of protection pays an initial or periodic premium to the seller and receives protection for the period of the contract. If there is no credit event, as defined in the contract, the seller of protection makes no payments to the buyer. If a credit event occurs, the seller of protection is required to make a payment to the buyer, calculated according to the terms of the contract. ##TABLE_END &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Credit Options.

In a credit option, the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell a reference obligation at a specified price or credit spread. The option purchaser buys the right, but does not assume the obligation, to sell the reference obligation to, or purchase it from, the option writer. The payments on credit options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the reference obligation. ##TABLE_END &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Credit Indices, Baskets and Tranches.

Credit derivatives may reference a basket of single-name credit default swaps or a broad-based index. If a credit event occurs in one of the underlying reference obligations, the protection seller pays the protection buyer. The payment is typically a pro-rata

portion of the transaction&#8217;s total notional amount based on the underlying defaulted reference obligation. In certain transactions, the credit risk of a basket or index is separated into various portions (tranches), each having different levels of subordination. The most junior tranches cover initial defaults and once losses exceed the notional amount of these junior tranches, any excess loss is covered by the next most senior tranche. ##TABLE_END &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Total Return Swaps.

A total return swap transfers the risks relating to economic performance of a reference obligation from the protection buyer to the protection seller. Typically, the protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and protection against any reduction in fair value of the reference obligation, and the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference obligation, plus any increase in the fair value of the reference obligation. ##TABLE_END &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The firm economically hedges its exposure to written credit derivatives primarily by entering into offsetting purchased credit derivatives with identical underliers. Substantially all of the firm&#8217;s purchased credit derivative transactions are with financial institutions and are subject to stringent collateral thresholds. In addition, upon the occurrence of a specified trigger event, the firm may take possession of the reference obligations underlying a particular written credit derivative, and consequently may, upon liquidation of the reference obligations, recover amounts on the underlying reference obligations in the event of default. 

As of December 2019, written credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $ 522.57 billion and purchased credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $ 581.76 billion, for total net notional purchased protection of $ 59.19 billion. As of December 2018, written credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $ 554.17 billion and purchased credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $ 603.00 billion, for total net notional purchased protection of $ 48.83 billion. The firm&#8217;s written and purchased credit derivatives primarily consist of credit default swaps.

Impact of Credit and Funding Spreads on Derivatives 

The firm realizes gains or losses on its derivative contracts. These gains or losses, include credit valuation adjustments (CVA) relating to uncollateralized derivative assets and liabilities, which represents the gains or losses (including hedges) attributable to the impact of changes in credit exposure, counterparty credit spreads, liability funding spreads (which includes the firm&#8217;s own credit), probability of default and assumed recovery. These gains or losses also include funding valuation adjustments (FVA) relating to uncollateralized derivative assets, which represents the gains or losses (including hedges) attributable to the impact of changes in expected funding exposures and funding spreads.

Derivatives with Credit-Related Contingent Features 

Certain of the firm&#8217;s derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require the firm to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in the firm&#8217;s credit ratings. The firm assesses the impact of these bilateral agreements by determining the collateral or termination payments that would occur assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies. A downgrade by any one rating agency, depending on the agency&#8217;s relative ratings of the firm at the time of the downgrade, may have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all rating agencies.

Hedge Accounting 

The firm applies hedge accounting for (i) certain interest rate swaps used to manage the interest rate exposure of certain fixed-rate unsecured long-term and short-term borrowings and certain fixed-rate certificates of deposit and (ii) certain foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency-denominated debt used to manage foreign currency exposures on the firm&#8217;s net investment in certain non-U.S.

operations.

To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging instrument must be highly effective at reducing the risk from the exposure being hedged. Additionally, the firm must formally document the hedging relationship at inception and assess the hedging relationship at least on a quarterly basis to ensure the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective over the life of the hedging relationship. 

Fair Value Hedges 

The firm designates certain interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of certain fixed-rate unsecured long-term and short-term debt and fixed-rate certificates of deposit. These interest rate swaps hedge changes in fair value attributable to the designated benchmark interest rate (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or Overnight Index Swap Rate), effectively converting a substantial portion of fixed-rate obligations into floating-rate obligations. 

The firm applies a statistical method that utilizes regression analysis when assessing the effectiveness of its fair value hedging relationships in achieving offsetting changes in the fair values of the hedging instrument and the risk being hedged (i.e., interest rate risk). An interest rate swap is considered highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value attributable to changes in the hedged risk when the regression analysis results in a coefficient of determination of 80% or greater and a slope between 80% and 125%. 

For qualifying fair value hedges, gains or losses on derivatives are included in interest expense. The change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged is reported as an adjustment to its carrying value (hedging adjustment) and is also included in interest expense. When a derivative is no longer designated as a hedge, any remaining difference between the carrying value and par value of the hedged item is amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the hedged item using the effective interest method. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense.

The table below presents the gains/(losses) from interest rate derivatives accounted for as hedges and the related hedged borrowings and deposits, and total interest expense.

Net Investment Hedges 

The firm seeks to reduce the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on its net investments in certain non-U.S.

operations through the use of foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency-denominated debt. For foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges, the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed based on the overall changes in the fair value of the forward contracts (i.e., based on changes in forward rates). For foreign currency-denominated debt designated as a hedge, the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed based on changes in spot rates. For qualifying net investment hedges, all gains or losses on the hedging instruments are included in currency translation.

The table below presents the gains/(losses) from net investment hedging.

Investments in Funds at Net Asset Value Per Share.

Equity securities and debt instruments, 

at fair value include investments in funds that are measured at NAV of the investment fund. The firm uses NAV to measure the fair value of fund investments when (i) the fund investment does not have a readily determinable fair value and (ii) the NAV of the investment fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of investment company accounting, including measurement of the investments at fair value.

Substantially all of the firm&#8217;s investments in funds at NAV consist of investments in firm-sponsored private equity, credit, real estate and hedge funds where the firm co-invests 

with third-party investors.

Private equity funds primarily invest in a broad range of industries worldwide, including leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations, growth investments and distressed investments. Credit funds generally invest in loans and other fixed income instruments and are focused on providing private high-yield capital for leveraged and management buyout transactions, recapitalizations, financings, refinancings, acquisitions and restructurings for private equity firms, private family companies and corporate issuers. Real estate funds invest globally, primarily in real estate companies, loan portfolios, debt recapitalizations and property. Private equity, credit and real estate funds are closed-end

funds in which the firm&#8217;s investments are generally not eligible for redemption. Distributions will be received from these funds as the underlying assets are liquidated or distributed, the timing of which is uncertain.

The firm also invests in hedge funds, primarily multi-disciplinary hedge funds that employ a fundamental bottom-up

investment approach across various asset classes and strategies. The firm&#8217;s investments in hedge funds primarily include interests where the underlying assets are illiquid in nature, and proceeds from redemptions will not be received until the underlying assets are liquidated or distributed, the timing of which is uncertain.

Private equity, hedge and real estate funds described above are primarily &#8220;covered funds&#8221; as defined in the Volcker Rule of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) extended the conformance period to July 2022 for the firm&#8217;s investments in, and relationships with, certain legacy &#8220;illiquid funds&#8221; (as defined in the Volcker Rule) that were in place prior to December 2013. This extension is applicable to substantially all of the firm&#8217;s remaining investments in, and relationships with, such covered funds. Substantially all of the credit funds described above are not covered funds.

##TABLE_END 

In the table above: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of investment. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Weighted averages are calculated by weighting each input by the relative fair value of the investment. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

The ranges and weighted averages of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one investment. For example, the highest multiple for private equity securities is appropriate for valuing a specific private equity security but may not be appropriate for valuing any other private equity security. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 investments. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Increases in yield, discount rate, capitalization rate or duration used in the valuation of level 3 investments would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement, while increases in recovery rate or multiples would have resulted in a higher fair value measurement as of both December 2019 and December 2018. Due to the distinctive nature of each level 3 investment, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Corporate debt securities, securities backed by real estate and other debt obligations are valued using discounted cash flows, and equity securities are valued using market comparables and discounted cash flows. ##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226;

The fair value of any one instrument may be determined using multiple valuation techniques. For example, market comparables and discounted cash flows may be used together to determine fair value. Therefore, the level 3 balance encompasses both of these techniques. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Recovery rate was not significant to the valuation of level 3 securities backed by real estate as of December 2018. ##TABLE_END

Level 3 Rollforward Commentary 

Year Ended December 2019.

The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 investments of $ 1.55 billion (reflecting $ 252 million of net realized gains and $ 1.30 billion of net unrealized gains) for 2019 included gains of $ 1.44 billion reported in other principal transactions and $ 108 million reported in interest income.

The net unrealized gains on level 3 investments for 2019 primarily reflected gains on private equity securities, principally driven by corporate performance and company-specific events. 

Transfers into level 3 during 2019 primarily reflected transfers of certain private equity securities and corporate debt securities from level 2, principally due to reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence, including fewer transactions in these instruments. 

Transfers out of level 3 investments during 2019 primarily reflected transfers of certain private equity securities and corporate debt securities to level 2, principally due to increased price transparency as a result of market evidence, including market transactions in these instruments. 

Year Ended December 2018.

The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 investments of $ 1.07 billion (reflecting $ 237 million of net realized gains and $ 834 million of net unrealized gains) for 2018 included gains of $ 848 million reported in other principal transactions and $ 223 million reported in interest income.

The net unrealized gains on level 3 investments for 2018 primarily reflected gains on private equity securities, principally driven by corporate performance. 

Transfers into level 3 during 2018 primarily reflected transfers of certain private equity securities and corporate debt instruments from level 2, principally due to reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence, including fewer transactions in these instruments.

Held-to-maturity

securities in an unrealized loss position are periodically reviewed for other-than-temporary impairment. The firm considers various factors, including market conditions, changes in issuer credit ratings, severity and duration of the unrealized losses, and the intent and ability to hold the security until recovery to determine if the securities are other-than-temporarily impaired. There were no such impairments during 2019, 2018 or 2017. ##TABLE_END

Loans 

Loans include (i) loans held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost net of allowance for loan losses or at fair value under the fair value option and (ii) loans held for sale that are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value. Interest on loans is recognized over the life of the loan and is recorded on an accrual basis.&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203; &#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;&#8203;

Credit Quality 

Risk Assessment.

The firm&#8217;s risk assessment process includes evaluating the credit quality of its loans. For loans (excluding originated and purchased consumer and credit card loans, PCI loans and certain wealth management loans backed by residential real estate), the firm performs credit reviews which include initial and ongoing analyses of its borrowers, resulting in an internal credit rating. A credit review is an independent analysis of the capacity and willingness of a borrower to meet its financial obligations. The determination of internal credit ratings also incorporates assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the borrower&#8217;s industry and the economic environment.

The table below presents gross loans by an internally determined public rating agency equivalent or other credit metrics and the concentration of secured and unsecured loans.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

For purchased consumer and credit card loans, PCI loans and certain wealth management loans backed by residential real estate, the firm&#8217;s risk assessment process includes reviewing certain key metrics, such as loan-to-value ratio, delinquency status, collateral values, expected cash flows, the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit score and other risk factors. 

For originated consumer and credit card loans, an important credit-quality indicator is the 

FICO credit score, which measures a borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness by considering factors such as payment and credit history. FICO credit scores are refreshed periodically by the firm to assess the updated creditworthiness of the borrower. 

The table below presents gross consumer and credit card loans and the concentration by refreshed FICO credit score.

##TABLE_END 

Impaired Loans.

Loans accounted for at amortized cost (excluding PCI loans) are determined to be impaired when it is probable that the firm will not collect all principal and interest due under the contractual terms. At that time, such loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status and all accrued but uncollected interest is reversed against interest income and interest subsequently collected is recognized on a cash basis to the extent the loan balance is deemed collectible. Otherwise, all cash received is used to reduce the outstanding loan balance. A loan is considered past due when a principal or interest payment has not been made according to its contractual terms. 

In certain circumstances, the firm may also modify the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. Such modifications are considered troubled debt restructurings and typically include interest rate reductions, payment extensions, and modification of loan covenants. Loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring are considered impaired and are subject to specific loan-level reserves.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

The gross carrying value of impaired loans (excluding PCI loans) on nonaccrual status was $ 1.49 billion as of December 2019 and $ 838 million as of December 2018. Such loans included $ 251 million as of December 2019 and $ 27 million as of December 2018 of corporate loans that were modified in a troubled debt restructuring. The firm&#8217;s lending commitments related to these loans were not material as of both December 2019 and December 2018. The amount of loans 30 days or more past due was $ 627 million as of December 2019 and $ 208 million as of December 2018. 

When it is determined that the firm cannot reasonably estimate expected cash flows on PCI loans or pools of loans, such loans are placed on nonaccrual status. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The firm&#8217;s allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for losses on loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost. Loans and lending commitments accounted for at fair value or accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value are not subject to an allowance for credit losses. 

The firm&#8217;s allowance for loan losses consists of specific loan-level reserves, portfolio-level reserves and reserves on PCI loans, as described below: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Specific loan-level reserves are determined on loans (excluding PCI loans) that exhibit credit quality weakness and are therefore individually evaluated for impairment. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Portfolio-level reserves are determined on loans (excluding PCI loans) not evaluated for specific loan-level reserves by aggregating groups of loans with similar risk characteristics and estimating the probable loss inherent in the portfolio. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Reserves on PCI loans are recorded when it is determined that the expected cash flows, which are reassessed on a quarterly basis, will be lower than those used to establish the current effective yield for such loans or pools of loans. If the expected cash flows are determined to be significantly higher than those used to establish the current effective yield, such increases are initially recognized as a reduction to any previously recorded allowances for loan losses and any remaining increases are recognized as interest income prospectively over the life of the loan or pools of loans as an increase to the effective yield. ##TABLE_END 

The allowance for loan losses is determined using various risk factors, including industry default and loss data, current macroeconomic indicators, borrower&#8217;s capacity to meet its financial obligations, borrower&#8217;s country of risk, loan seniority and collateral type. In addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio and home price index. Risk factors for consumer and credit card loans include FICO credit scores and delinquency status. 

Management&#8217;s estimate of loan losses entails judgment about loan collectability at the reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. While management uses the best information available to determine this estimate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, among other things, changes in the economic environment or variances between actual results and the original assumptions used. Loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when deemed to be uncollectible.

The firm also records an allowance for losses on lending commitments that are held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost. Such allowance is determined using the same methodology as the allowance for loan losses, while also taking into consideration the probability of drawdowns or funding, and is included in other liabilities. 

The table below presents gross loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost by impairment methodology.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

In the table above: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of loan. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Weighted averages are calculated by weighting each input by the relative fair value of the loan. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

The ranges and weighted averages of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one loan. For example, the highest yield for residential real estate loans is appropriate for valuing a specific residential real estate loan but may not be appropriate for valuing any other residential real estate loan. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 loans. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Increases in yield or duration used in the valuation of level 3 loans would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement, while increases in recovery rate would have resulted in a higher fair value measurement as of both December 2019 and December 2018. Due to the distinctive nature of each level 3 loan, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Loans are valued using discounted cash flows. ##TABLE_END

Year Ended December 2019.

The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 loans of $ 131 million (reflecting $ 46 million of net realized gains and $ 85 million of net unrealized gains) for 2019 included gains of $ 98 million reported in other principal transactions and $ 33 million reported in interest income.

The drivers of the net unrealized gains on level 3 loans for 2019 were not material. 

Transfers into level 3 loans during 2019 primarily reflected transfers of certain corporate loans from level 2, principally due to reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence. 

The drivers of transfers out of level 3 loans during 2019 were not material.

Year Ended December 2018.

The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 loans of $ 146 million (reflecting $ 74 million of net realized gains and $ 72 million of net unrealized gains) for 2018 included gains of $ 52 million reported in other principal transactions and $ 94 million reported in interest income.

The drivers of the net unrealized gains on level 3 loans for 2018 were not material. 

Transfers into level 3 loans during 2018 primarily reflected transfers of certain commercial real estate and corporate loans from level 2, principally due to reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence. 

Transfers out of level 3 loans during 2018 primarily reflected transfers of certain commercial real estate loans to level 2, principally due to certain unobservable yield and duration inputs no longer being significant to the valuation of these instruments. 

Estimated Fair Value

Note 10. 

Fair Value Option 

Other Financial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value 

In addition to trading assets and liabilities, and certain investments and loans, the firm accounts for certain of its other financial assets and liabilities at fair value, substantially all under the fair value option. The primary reasons for electing the fair value option are to: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Reflect economic events in earnings on a timely basis; ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Mitigate volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes (e.g., transfers of financial assets accounted for as financings are recorded at fair value, whereas the related secured financing would be recorded on an accrual basis absent electing the fair value option); and ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Address simplification and cost-benefit considerations (e.g., accounting for hybrid financial instruments at fair value in their entirety versus bifurcation of embedded derivatives and hedge accounting for debt hosts). ##TABLE_END 

Hybrid financial instruments are instruments that contain bifurcatable embedded derivatives and do not require settlement by physical delivery of nonfinancial assets (e.g., physical commodities). If the firm elects to bifurcate the embedded derivative from the associated debt, the derivative is accounted for at fair value and the host contract is accounted for at amortized cost, adjusted for the effective portion of any fair value hedges. If the firm does not elect to bifurcate, the entire hybrid financial instrument is accounted for at fair value under the fair value option. 

Other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value under the fair value option include: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Repurchase agreements and substantially all resale agreements; ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Securities borrowed and loaned in FICC financing; ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Certain unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, substantially all of which are hybrid financial instruments; ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Certain customer and other receivables, including certain margin loans; and ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Certain time deposits (deposits with no stated maturity are not eligible for a fair value option election), including structured certificates of deposit, which are hybrid financial instruments. ##TABLE_END

See Note 4 for an overview of the firm&#8217;s fair value measurement policies and the valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of other financial assets and liabilities.

Significant Inputs 

See below for information about the significant inputs (including the significant unobservable inputs) used to value other financial assets and liabilities at fair value. 

Resale and Repurchase Agreements and Securities Borrowed and Loaned.

As of both December 2019 and December 2018, the firm had no level 3 resale agreements, securities borrowed or securities loaned. As of both December 2019 and December 2018, the firm&#8217;s level 3 repurchase agreements were not material.

Customer and Other Receivables.

As of December 2019, the firm had no level 3 customer and other receivables. As of December 2018, the firm&#8217;s level 3 customer and other receivables were not material.

Deposits. 

The firm&#8217;s deposits that are classified in level 3 are hybrid financial instruments. As the significant unobservable inputs used to value such instruments primarily relate to the embedded derivative component of these deposits, these unobservable inputs are incorporated in the firm&#8217;s derivative disclosures in Note 7.

Other Secured Financings.

The ranges and weighted averages of significant unobservable inputs used to value level 3 other secured financings as of December 2019 are presented below. These ranges and weighted averages exclude unobservable inputs that are only relevant to a single instrument, and therefore are not meaningful.

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Yield: 3.3 % to 4.2 % (weighted average: 3.5 %) ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Duration: 0.6 to 2.1 years (weighted average: 1.0 year) ##TABLE_END 

Generally, increases in yield or duration, in isolation, would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement as of December 2019. Due to the distinctive nature of each of level 3 other secured financings, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform across such financings. As of December 2018, level 3 other secured financings were not material. 

Unsecured Short- and Long-Term Borrowings.

Certain of the firm&#8217;s unsecured short- and long-term borrowings are classified in level 3, substantially all of which are hybrid financial instruments. As the significant unobservable inputs used to value hybrid financial instruments primarily relate to the embedded derivative component of these borrowings, these unobservable inputs are incorporated in the firm&#8217;s derivative disclosures in Note 7.

Other Liabilities.

As of both December 2019 and December 2018, the firm&#8217;s level 3 other liabilities were not material.

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are reported at the beginning of the reporting period in which they occur. If a financial asset or liability was transferred to level 3 during a reporting period, its entire gain or loss for the period is classified in level 3. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Level 3 other financial assets and liabilities are frequently economically hedged with trading assets and liabilities. Accordingly, gains or losses that are classified in level 3 can be partially offset by gains or losses attributable to level 1, 2 or 3 trading assets and liabilities. As a result, gains or losses included in the level 3 rollforward below do not necessarily represent the overall impact on the firm&#8217;s results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. ##TABLE_END

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Level 3 Rollforward Commentary 

Year Ended December 2019.

The net realized and unrealized losses on level 3 other financial liabilities of $ 2.59 billion (reflecting $ 337 million of net realized losses and $ 2.25 billion of net unrealized losses) for 2019 included losses of $ 1.98 billion reported in market making, $ 10 million reported in other principal transactions and $ 9 million reported in interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings, and $ 595 million reported in debt valuation adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

The unrealized losses on level 3 other financial liabilities for 2019 primarily reflected losses on certain hybrid financial instruments included in unsecured long- and short-term borrowings, principally due to an increase in global equity prices, and losses on certain hybrid financial instruments included in deposits, due to the impact of an increase in the market value of the underlying assets. 

Transfers into level 3 other financial liabilities during 2019 primarily reflected transfers of certain hybrid financial instruments included in unsecured long- and short-term borrowings and other secured financings from level 2, principally due to reduced price transparency of certain volatility and correlation inputs used to value these instruments. 

Transfers out of level 3 other financial liabilities during 2019 primarily reflected transfers of certain hybrid financial instruments included in unsecured long- and short-term borrowings to level 2, principally due to increased price transparency of certain volatility and correlation inputs used to value these instruments. 

Year Ended December 2018.

The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 other financial liabilities of $ 1.52 billion (reflecting $ 491 million of net realized losses and $ 2.01 billion of net unrealized gains) for 2018 included gains/(losses) of $ 883 million reported in market making, $( 1 ) million reported in other principal transactions and $( 1 ) million reported in interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings, and $ 641 million reported in debt valuation adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

The net unrealized gains on level 3 other financial liabilities for 2018 primarily reflected gains on certain hybrid financial instruments included in unsecured long-term borrowings, principally due to the impact of wider credit spreads and increases in interest rates, and gains on certain hybrid financial instruments included in unsecured short-term borrowings, principally due to a decrease in global equity prices. 

Transfers into level 3 other financial liabilities during 2018 primarily reflected transfers of certain hybrid financial instruments included in unsecured long-term borrowings from level 2, principally due to reduced transparency of certain inputs used to value these instruments as a result of a lack of market transactions in similar instruments. 

Transfers out of level 3 other financial liabilities during 2018 primarily reflected transfers of certain hybrid financial instruments included in unsecured long- and short-term borrowings to level 2, principally due to increased transparency of certain volatility and correlation inputs used to value these instruments.

Gains/(losses) included in unsecured short- and long-term borrowings were substantially all related to the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial instruments for 2019, 2018 and 2017.

Other financial assets and liabilities at fair value are frequently economically hedged with trading assets and liabilities. Accordingly, gains or losses on such other financial assets and liabilities can be partially offset by gains or losses on trading assets and liabilities. As a result, gains or losses on other financial assets and liabilities do not necessarily represent the overall impact on the firm&#8217;s results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. ##TABLE_END &#160;

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

See Note 8 for information about gains/(losses) on equity securities and Note 9 for information about gains/(losses) on loans which are accounted for at fair value under the fair value option. Gains/(losses) on trading assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value under the fair value option are included in market making. See Note 5 for further information about gains/(losses) from market making. 

Long-Term Debt Instruments 

The difference between the aggregate contractual principal amount and the related fair value of long-term other secured financings for which the fair value option was elected was not material as of both December 2019 and December 2018. 

The fair value of unsecured long-term borrowings exceeded the aggregate contractual principal amount by $ 199 million as of December 2019, and the aggregate contractual principal amount exceeded the related fair value by $ 3.47 billion as of December 2018. The amounts above include both principal-protected and non-principal-protected long-term borrowings. 

Debt Valuation Adjustment 

The firm calculates the fair value of financial liabilities for which the fair value option is elected by discounting future cash flows at a rate which incorporates the firm&#8217;s credit spreads. 

The table below presents information about the net debt valuation adjustment (DVA) gains/(losses) on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected.

In the table above, the aggregate contractual principal amount of loans on nonaccrual status and/or more than 90 days past due (which excludes loans carried at zero fair value and considered uncollectible) exceeds the related fair value primarily because the firm regularly purchases loans, such as distressed loans, at values significantly below the contractual principal amounts. 

The fair value of unfunded lending commitments for which the fair value option was elected was a liability of $ 373 million as of December 2019 and $ 45 million as of December 2018, and the related total contractual amount of these lending commitments was $ 1.55 billion as of December 2019 and $ 1.89 billion as of December 2018. See Note 18 for further information about lending commitments. 

Impact of Credit Spreads on Loans and Lending Commitments 

The estimated net gain attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit spreads on loans and lending commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $ 134 million for 2019, $ 211 million for 2018 and $ 268 million for 2017. The firm generally calculates the fair value of loans and lending commitments for which the fair value option is elected by discounting future cash flows at a rate which incorporates the instrument-specific credit spreads. For floating-rate loans and lending commitments, substantially all changes in fair value are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit spreads, whereas for fixed-rate loans and lending commitments, changes in fair value are also attributable to changes in interest rates.

Collateralized Agreements and Financings 

Collateralized agreements are resale agreements and securities borrowed. Collateralized financings are repurchase agreements, securities loaned and other secured financings. The firm enters into these transactions in order to, among other things, facilitate client activities, invest excess cash, acquire securities to cover short positions and finance certain firm activities. 

Collateralized agreements and financings are presented on a net-by-counterparty

basis when a legal right of setoff exists. Interest on collateralized agreements, which is included in interest income, and collateralized financings, which is included in interest expense, is recognized over the life of the transaction. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense.

Resale and Repurchase Agreements 

A resale agreement is a transaction in which the firm purchases financial instruments from a seller, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to resell the same or substantially the same financial instruments to the seller at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date. 

A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the firm sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date. 

Even though repurchase and resale agreements (including &#8220;repos- and reverses-to-maturity&#8221;) involve the legal transfer of ownership of financial instruments, they are accounted for as financing arrangements because they require the financial instruments to be repurchased or resold before or at the maturity of the agreement. The financial instruments purchased or sold in resale and repurchase agreements typically include U.S. government and agency, and investment-grade sovereign obligations.

The firm receives financial instruments purchased under resale agreements and makes delivery of financial instruments sold under repurchase agreements. To mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors the market value of these financial instruments on a daily basis, and delivers or obtains additional collateral due to changes in the market value of the financial instruments, as appropriate. For resale agreements, the firm typically requires collateral with a fair value approximately equal to the carrying value of the relevant assets in the consolidated balance sheets. 

Securities Borrowed and Loaned Transactions 

In a securities borrowed transaction, the firm borrows securities from a counterparty in exchange for cash or securities. When the firm returns the securities, the counterparty returns the cash or securities. Interest is generally paid periodically over the life of the transaction. 

In a securities loaned transaction, the firm lends securities to a counterparty in exchange for cash or securities. When the counterparty returns the securities, the firm returns the cash or securities posted as collateral. Interest is generally paid periodically over the life of the transaction. 

The firm receives securities borrowed and makes delivery of securities loaned. To mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors the market value of these securities on a daily basis, and delivers or obtains additional collateral due to changes in the market value of the securities, as appropriate. For securities borrowed transactions, the firm typically requires collateral with a fair value approximately equal to the carrying value of the securities borrowed transaction.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Securities borrowed and loaned within FICC financing are recorded at fair value under the fair value option. See Note 10 for further information about securities borrowed and loaned accounted for at fair value. 

Securities borrowed and loaned within Equit ies

financing are recorded based on the amount of cash collateral advanced or received plus accrued interest. As these agreements generally can be terminated on demand, they exhibit little, if any, sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Therefore, the carrying value of such agreements approximates fair value. As these agreements are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these agreements been included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy, they would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2019 and December 2018.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Other Secured Financings 

In addition to repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions, the firm funds certain assets through the use of other secured financings and pledges financial instruments and other assets as collateral in these transactions. These other secured financings consist of:

Other secured financings included nonrecourse arrangements. Nonrecourse other secured financings were $ 10.91 billion as of December 2019 and $ 8.47 billion as of December 2018. 

The firm has elected to apply the fair value option to substantially all other secured financings because the use of fair value eliminates non-economic

volatility in earnings that would arise from using different measurement attributes. See Note 10 for further information about other secured financings that are accounted for at fair value. 

Other secured financings that are not recorded at fair value are recorded based on the amount of cash received plus accrued interest, which generally approximates fair value. As these financings are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these financings been included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy, they would have been primarily classified in level 2 as of both December 2019 and December 2018.

The firm obtains cash and securities as collateral on an upfront or contingent basis for derivative instruments and collateralized agreements to reduce its credit exposure to individual counterparties. 

In many cases, the firm is permitted to deliver or repledge financial instruments received as collateral when entering into repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions, primarily in connection with secured client financing activities. The firm is also permitted to deliver or repledge these financial instruments in connection with other secured financings, collateralized derivative transactions and firm or customer settlement requirements. 

The firm also pledges certain trading assets in connection with repurchase agreements, securities loaned transactions and other secured financings, and other assets (substantially all real estate and cash) in connection with other secured financings to counterparties who may or may not have the right to deliver or repledge them. 

The table below presents financial instruments at fair value received as collateral that were available to be delivered or repledged and were delivered or repledged.

Property, Leasehold Improvements and Equipment 

Property, leasehold improvements and equipment is net of accumulated depreciation and amortization of $ 9.95 billion as of December 2019 and $ 9.08 billion as of December 2018. Property, leasehold improvements and equipment included $ 6.16 billion as of December 2019 and $ 5.57 billion as of December 2018 that the firm uses in connection with its operations, and $ 521 million as of December 2019 and $ 896 million as of December 2018 of foreclosed real estate primarily related to PCI loans. The remainder is held by investment entities, including VIEs, consolidated by the firm. Substantially all property and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease. Capitalized costs of software developed or obtained for internal use are amortized on a straight-line basis over three years . 

The firm tests property, leasehold improvements and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset&#8217;s or asset group&#8217;s carrying value may not be fully recoverable. To the extent the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group, the firm determines the asset or asset group is impaired and records an impairment equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset or asset group. In addition, the firm will recognize an impairment prior to the sale of an asset or asset group if the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.

There were no material impairments during 2019, 2018 or 2017. 

Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets 

Goodwill.

Goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, at the acquisition date.

During the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the changes to the firm&#8217;s business segments, the firm reassigned the goodwill to its new reporting units. 

The table below presents the carrying value of goodwill by reporting unit.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative assessment.

The quantitative goodwill test compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its estimated net book value (including goodwill and identifiable intangible assets). If the reporting unit&#8217;s estimated fair value exceeds its estimated net book value, goodwill is not impaired. An impairment is recognized if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated net book value. 

During the fourth quarter of 2019, goodwill was tested for impairment using a quantitative test (both prior to and following the firm&#8217;s changes to its business segments) and the qualitative assessment was not performed. For each test, the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective net carrying value, and therefore, goodwill was not impaired. 

To estimate the fair value of each reporting unit, other than Consumer banking, a relative value technique was used because the firm believes market participants would use this technique to value these reporting units. The relative value technique applies observable price-to-earnings

multiples or price-to-book

multiples of comparable competitors to reporting units&#8217; net earnings or net book value. To estimate the fair value of Consumer banking, a discounted cash flow valuation approach was used because the firm believes market participants would use this technique to value that reporting unit given its early stage of development. The estimated net carrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders&#8217; equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders&#8217; equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

The firm tests intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset&#8217;s or asset group&#8217;s carrying value may not be fully recoverable. To the extent the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group, the firm determines the asset or asset group is impaired and records an impairment equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset or asset group. In addition, the firm will recognize an impairment prior to the sale of an asset or asset group if the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. There were no material impairments during 2019, 2018 or 2017. 

Operating Lease Right-of-Use

Assets 

The firm enters into operating leases for real estate, office equipment and other assets, substantially all of which are used in connection with its operations. The firm adopted ASU No. 2016-02

in January 2019, which required the firm to recognize, for leases longer than one year, a right-of-use 

asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability representing the liability to make payments. The lease term is generally determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease. For leases where the firm has the option to terminate or extend the lease, an assessment of the likelihood of exercising the option is incorporated into the determination of the lease term. Such assessment is initially performed at the inception of the lease and is updated if events occur that impact the original assessment.

An operating lease right-of-use

asset is initially determined based on the operating lease liability, adjusted for initial direct costs, lease incentives and amounts paid at or prior to lease commencement. This amount is then amortized over the lease term. The firm recognized $ 963 million (primarily related to the firm&#8217;s new European headquarters in London) of right-of-use

assets and operating lease liabilities in non-cash

transactions for leases entered into or assumed during 2019. See Note 15 for information about operating lease liabilities.

For leases where the firm will derive no economic benefit from leased space that it has vacated or where the firm has shortened the term of a lease when space is no longer needed, the firm will record an impairment or accelerated amortization of right-of-use

assets. There were no material impairments or

accelerated amortizations during 2019.

In addition, assets classified as held for sale also included assets of $ 1.01 billion as of December 2018, related to the firm&#8217;s new European headquarters in London. This property was sold in January 2019 pursuant to a sale and leaseback agreement and the firm recognized a right-of-use

asset upon the leaseback. ##TABLE_END &#160;

offices included $ 12.45 billion of time deposits in denominations that met or exceeded the applicable insurance limits, or were otherwise not covered by insurance.

The firm&#8217;s savings and demand deposits are recorded based on the amount of cash received plus accrued interest , which approximates fair value. In addition, the firm designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges to convert a portion of its time deposits not accounted for at fair value from fixed-rate obligations into floating-rate obligations. The carrying value of time deposits not accounted for at fair value approximated fair value as of both December 2019 and December 2018. As these savings and demand deposits and time deposits are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these deposits been included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy, they would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2019 and December 2018.

Unsecured Short-Term Borrowings 

Unsecured short-term borrowings includes the portion of unsecured long-term borrowings maturing within one year of the financial statement date and unsecured long-term borrowings that are redeemable within one year of the financial statement date at the option of the holder.

The firm accounts for certain hybrid financial instruments at fair value under the fair value option. See Note 10 for further information about unsecured short-term borrowings that are accounted for at fair value. In addition, the firm designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges to convert a portion of its unsecured short-term borrowings not accounted for at fair value from fixed-rate obligations into floating-rate obligations. The carrying value of unsecured short-term borrowings that are not recorded at fair value generally approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the obligations. As these unsecured short-term borrowings are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these borrowings been included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2019 and December 2018.

In the table above, the aggregate amounts of unsecured long-term borrowings had weighted average interest rates of 2.87 % ( 3.77 % related to fixed-rate obligations and 2.48 % related to floating-rate obligations) as of December 2019 and 3.21 % ( 3.79 % related to fixed-rate obligations and 2.79 % related to floating-rate obligations) as of December 2018. These rates exclude unsecured long-term borrowings accounted for at fair value under the fair value option. 

As of both December 2019 and December 2018, the carrying value of unsecured long-term borrowings for which the firm did not elect the fair value option approximated fair value. As these borrowings are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these borrowings been included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2019 and December 2018.

Junior Subordinated Debt 

In 2004, Group Inc. issued $ 2.84 billion of junior subordinated debt to Goldman Sachs Capital I (Trust), a Delaware statutory trust. The Trust issued $ 2.75 billion of guaranteed preferred beneficial interests (Trust Preferred securities) to third parties and $ 85 million of common beneficial interests to Group Inc. 

As of December 2019, the outstanding par amount of junior subordinated debt held by the Trust was $ 976 million and the outstanding par amount of Trust Preferred securities and common beneficial interests issued by the Trust was $ 947 million and $ 29 million, respectively. As of December 2018, the outstanding par amount of junior subordinated debt held by the Trust was $ 1.14 billion and the outstanding par amount of Trust Preferred securities and common beneficial interests issued by the Trust was $ 1.11 billion and $ 34.1 million, respectively. 

The firm purchased Trust Preferred securities with a par amount and a carrying value of $ 159 million and $ 206 million in 2019, $ 28 million and $ 35 million in 2018, and $ 186 million and $ 237 million in 2017, respectively. These securities were delivered to the Trust, along with common beneficial interests of $ 5 million in 2019, $ 1 million in 2018 and $ 6 million in 2017, in a non-cash 

exchange for junior subordinated debt with a par amount and carrying value of $ 164 million and $ 231 million in 2019, $ 29 million and $ 36 million in 2018, and $ 192 million and $ 254 million in 2017, respectively. Following the exchanges, these Trust Preferred securities, common beneficial interests and junior subordinated debt were extinguished. The Trust is a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the firm for regulatory and legal purposes but is not consolidated for accounting purposes.

The firm pays interest semi-annually on the junior subordinated debt at an annual rate of 6.345 % and the debt matures on February 15, 2034 . The coupon rate and the payment dates applicable to the beneficial interests are the same as the interest rate and payment dates for the junior subordinated debt. The firm has the right, from time to time, to defer payment of interest on the junior subordinated debt, and therefore cause payment on the Trust&#8217;s preferred beneficial interests to be deferred, in each case up to ten consecutive semi-annual periods. During any such deferral period, the firm will not be permitted to, among other things, pay dividends on or make certain repurchases of its common stock. The Trust is not permitted to pay any distributions on the common beneficial interests held by Group Inc. unless all dividends payable on the preferred beneficial interests have been paid in full. 

The firm has covenanted in favor of the holders of Group Inc.&#8217;s 6.345 % junior subordinated debt due February 15, 2034 , that, subject to certain exceptions, the firm will not redeem or purchase the capital securities issued by Goldman Sachs Capital II and Goldman Sachs Capital III (APEX Trusts) or shares of Group Inc.&#8217;s Perpetual Non-Cumulative

Preferred Stock, Series E (Series E Preferred Stock), Perpetual Non-Cumulative

Preferred Stock, Series F (Series F Preferred Stock) or Perpetual Non-Cumulative 

Preferred Stock, Series O, if the redemption or purchase results in less than $ 253 million aggregate liquidation preference of that series outstanding, prior to specified dates in 2022 for a price that exceeds a maximum amount determined by reference to the net cash proceeds that the firm has received from the sale of qualifying securities.

The APEX Trusts hold Group Inc.&#8217;s Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock. These trusts are Delaware statutory trusts sponsored by the firm and wholly-owned finance subsidiaries of the firm for regulatory and legal purposes but are not consolidated for accounting purposes.

Operating Lease Liabilities 

The firm adopted ASU No. 2016-02

in January 2019, which required the firm to recognize, for leases longer than one year, a right-of-use

asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability representing the liability to make payments. See Note 12 for information about operating lease right-of-use

assets.

Note 16. 

Securitization Activities 

The firm securitizes residential and commercial mortgages, corporate bonds, loans and other types of financial assets by selling these assets to securitization vehicles (e.g., trusts, corporate entities and limited liability companies) or through a resecuritization. The firm acts as underwriter of the beneficial interests that are sold to investors. The firm&#8217;s residential mortgage securitizations are primarily in connection with government agency securitizations. 

The firm accounts for a securitization as a sale when it has relinquished control over the transferred financial assets. Prior to securitization, the firm generally accounts for assets pending transfer at fair value and therefore does not typically recognize significant gains or losses upon the transfer of assets. Net revenues from underwriting activities are recognized in connection with the sales of the underlying beneficial interests to investors.

The firm generally receives cash in exchange for the transferred assets but may also have continuing involvement with the transferred financial assets, including ownership of beneficial interests in securitized financial assets, primarily in the form of debt instruments. The firm may also purchase senior or subordinated securities issued by securitization vehicles (which are typically VIEs) in connection with secondary market-making activities.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

The primary risks included in beneficial interests and other interests from the firm&#8217;s continuing involvement with securitization vehicles are the performance of the underlying collateral, the position of the firm&#8217;s investment in the capital structure of the securitization vehicle and the market yield for the security. These interests are primarily accounted for at fair value and classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Interests not accounted for at fair value are carried at amounts that approximate fair value. See Notes 4 through 10 for further information about fair value measurements. 

The table below presents the amount of financial assets securitized and the cash flows received on retained interests in securitization entities in which the firm had continuing involvement as of the end of the period.

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Changes in fair value based on an adverse variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the change in fair value is not usually linear. ##TABLE_END &#160;

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

The impact of a change in a particular assumption is calculated independently of changes in any other assumption. In practice, simultaneous changes in assumptions might magnify or counteract the sensitivities disclosed above. ##TABLE_END &#160;

The constant prepayment rate is included only for positions for which it is a key assumption in the determination of fair value. ##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

The discount rate for retained interests that relate to U.S. government agency-issued collateralized mortgage obligations does not include any credit loss. Expected credit loss assumptions are reflected in the discount rate for the remainder of retained interests. ##TABLE_END &#160;

The firm has other retained interests not reflected in the table above with a fair value of $ 149 million and a weighted average life of 3.3 years as of December 2019, and a fair value of $ 133 million and a weighted average life of 4.2 years as of December 2018. Due to the nature and fair value of certain of these retained interests, the weighted average assumptions for constant prepayment and discount rates and the related sensitivity to adverse changes are not meaningful as of both December 2019 and December 2018. The firm&#8217;s maximum exposure to adverse changes in the value of these interests is the carrying value of $ 149 million as of December 2019 and $ 133 million as of December 2018. 

Note 17. 

Variable Interest Entities 

A variable interest in a VIE is an investment (e.g., debt or equity) or other interest (e.g., derivatives or loans and lending commitments) that will absorb portions of the VIE&#8217;s expected losses and/or receive portions of the VIE&#8217;s expected residual returns. 

The firm&#8217;s variable interests in VIEs include senior and subordinated debt; loans and lending commitments; limited and general partnership interests; preferred and common equity; derivatives that may include foreign currency, equity and/or credit risk; guarantees; and certain of the fees the firm receives from investment funds. Certain interest rate, foreign currency and credit derivatives the firm enters into with VIEs are not variable interests because they create, rather than absorb, risk. 

VIEs generally finance the purchase of assets by issuing debt and equity securities that are either collateralized by or indexed to the assets held by the VIE. The debt and equity securities issued by a VIE may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. The firm&#8217;s involvement with VIEs includes securitization of financial assets, as described in Note 16, and investments in and loans to other types of VIEs, as described below. See Note 3 for the firm&#8217;s consolidation policies, including the definition of a VIE. 

VIE Consolidation Analysis 

The enterprise with a controlling financial interest in a VIE is known as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by performing an analysis that principally considers:

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

The firm reassesses its evaluation of whether an entity is a VIE when certain reconsideration events occur. The firm reassesses its determination of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on current facts and circumstances.

VIE Activities

The firm is principally involved with VIEs through the following business activities: 

Mortgage-Backed VIEs.

The firm sells residential and commercial mortgage loans and securities to mortgage-backed VIEs and may retain beneficial interests in the assets sold to these VIEs. The firm purchases and sells beneficial interests issued by mortgage-backed VIEs in connection with market-making activities. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives with certain of these VIEs, primarily interest rate swaps, which are typically not variable interests. The firm generally enters into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk.

Real Estate, Credit- and Power-Related and Other Investing VIEs.

The firm purchases equity and debt securities issued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold real estate, performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans, power-related assets and equity securities. The firm generally does not sell assets to, or enter into derivatives with, these VIEs.

Corporate Debt and Other Asset-Backed VIEs.

The firm structures VIEs that issue notes to clients, purchases and sells beneficial interests issued by corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs in connection with market-making activities, and makes loans to VIEs that warehouse corporate debt. Certain of these VIEs synthetically create the exposure for the beneficial interests they issue by entering into credit derivatives with the firm, rather than purchasing the underlying assets. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives, such as total return swaps, with certain corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs, under which the firm pays the VIE a return due to the beneficial interest holders and receives the return on the collateral owned by the VIE. The collateral owned by these VIEs is primarily other asset-backed loans and securities. The firm generally can be removed as the total return swap counterparty and enters into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk related to these swaps. The firm may sell assets to the corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs it structures.

Principal-Protected Note VIEs.

The firm structures VIEs that issue principal-protected notes to clients. These VIEs own portfolios of assets, principally with exposure to hedge funds. Substantially all of the principal protection on the notes issued by these VIEs is provided by the asset portfolio rebalancing that is required under the terms of the notes. The firm enters into total return swaps with these VIEs under which the firm pays the VIE the return due to the principal-protected note holders and receives the return on the assets owned by the VIE. The firm may enter into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk. The firm also obtains funding through these VIEs.

Investments in Funds.

The firm makes equity investments in certain investment fund VIEs it manages and is entitled to receive fees from these VIEs. The firm has generally not sold assets to, or entered into derivatives with, these VIEs.

Nonconsolidated VIEs 

The table below presents a summary of the nonconsolidated VIEs in which the firm holds variable interests.

Lending Commitments 

The firm&#8217;s commercial and warehouse financing lending commitments are agreements to lend with fixed termination dates and depend on the satisfaction of all contractual conditions to borrowing. These commitments are presented net of amounts syndicated to third parties. The total commitment amount does not necessarily reflect actual future cash flows because the firm may syndicate all or substantial portions of these commitments. In addition, commitments can expire unused or be reduced or cancelled at the counterparty&#8217;s request. The firm also provides credit to consumers by issuing credit card lines.

Held for investment lending commitments are accounted for on an accrual basis. The carrying value of lending commitments was a liability of $ 527 million (including allowance for losses of $ 361 million) as of December 2019 and $ 443 million (including allowance for losses of $ 286 million) as of December 2018. The estimated fair value of such lending commitments was a liability of $ 3.05 billion as of December 2019 and $ 3.78 billion as of December 2018. Had these lending commitments been carried at fair value and included in the fair value hierarchy, $ 1.78 billion as of December 2019 and $ 1.12 billion as of December 2018 would have been classified in level 2, and $ 1.27 billion as of December 2019 and $ 2.66 billion as of December 2018 would have been classified in level 3. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Held for sale lending commitments are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value. The carrying value of lending commitments held for sale was a liability of $ 60 million as of December 2019 and $ 155 million as of December 2018. The estimated fair value of such lending commitments approximates the carrying value. Had these lending commitments been included in the fair value hierarchy, they would have been primarily classified in level 2 as of both December 2019 and December &#160;

2018. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Gains or losses related to lending commitments at fair value, if any, are generally recorded net of any fees in other principal transactions. ##TABLE_END 

Commercial Lending.

The firm&#8217;s commercial lending commitments were primarily extended to investment-grade corporate borrowers. Such commitments primarily included $ 102.50 billion as of December 2019 and $ 93.99 billion as of December 2018, related to relationship lending activities (principally used for operating and general corporate purposes) and $ 33.47 billion as of December 2019 and $ 27.92 billion as of December 2018, related to other investment banking activities (generally extended for contingent acquisition financing and are often intended to be short-term in nature, as borrowers often seek to replace them with other funding sources). The firm also extends lending commitments in connection with other types of corporate lending, as well as commercial real estate financing. See Note 9 for further information about funded loans.

Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG) provides the firm with credit loss protection on certain approved loan commitments (primarily investment-grade commercial lending commitments). The notional amount of such loan commitments was $ 5.74 billion as of December 2019 and $ 15.52 billion as of December 2018. The credit loss protection on loan commitments provided by SMFG is generally limited to 95 % of the first loss the firm realizes on such commitments, up to a maximum of approximately $ 950 million. In addition, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, upon the firm&#8217;s request, SMFG will provide protection for 70 % of additional losses on such commitments, up to a maximum of $ 750 million, of which no protection had been provided as of December 2019 and $ 550 million was provided as of December 2018. The firm also uses other financial instruments to mitigate credit risks related to certain commitments not covered by SMFG. These instruments primarily include credit default swaps that reference the same or similar underlying instrument or entity, or credit default swaps that reference a credit index. 

Warehouse Financing.

The firm provides financing to clients who warehouse financial assets. These arrangements are secured by the warehoused assets, primarily consisting of consumer and corporate loans.

Credit Card.

The firm&#8217;s credit card lending commitments represents credit card lines issued by the firm to consumers. These credit card lines are cancelable by the firm.

Collateralized Agreement Commitments/ Collateralized Financing Commitments 

Collateralized agreement commitments includes forward starting resale and securities borrowing agreements, and collateralized financing commitments includes forward starting repurchase and secured lending agreements that settle at a future date, generally within three business days. Collateralized agreement commitments also includes transactions where the firm has entered into commitments to provide contingent financing to its clients and counterparties through resale agreements. The firm&#8217;s funding of these commitments depends on the satisfaction of all contractual conditions to the resale agreement and these commitments can expire unused. 

Letters of Credit 

The firm has commitments under letters of credit issued by various banks which the firm provides to counterparties in lieu of securities or cash to satisfy various collateral and margin deposit requirements.

Investment Commitments 

Investment commitments includes commitments to invest in private equity, real estate and other assets directly and through funds that the firm raises and manages. Investment commitments included $ 2.06 billion as of December 2019 and $ 2.42 billion as of December 2018, related to commitments to invest in funds managed by the firm. If these commitments are called, they would be funded at market value on the date of investment. 

Contingencies 

Legal Proceedings.

See Note 27 for information about legal proceedings, including certain mortgage-related matters.

Certain Mortgage-Related Contingencies.

During the period 2005 through 2008 in connection with both sales and securitizations of loans, the firm provided loan-level representations and/or assigned the loan-level representations from the party from whom the firm purchased the loans.

Based on the large number of defaults in residential mortgages, including those sold or securitized by the firm, there is a potential for repurchase claims. However, the firm is not in a position to make a meaningful estimate of that exposure at this time. The firm&#8217;s exposure to claims for repurchase of residential mortgage loans based on alleged breaches of representations will depend on a number of factors, such as the extent to which these claims are made within the statute of limitations, taking into consideration the agreements to toll the statute of limitations the firm entered into with trustees representing certain trusts. 

Other Contingencies.

In connection with the sale of Metro International Trade Services (Metro), the firm agreed to provide indemnities to the buyer, which primarily relate to fundamental representations and warranties, and potential liabilities for legal or regulatory proceedings arising out of the conduct of Metro&#8217;s business while the firm owned it.

In connection with the settlement agreement with the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group of the U.S. Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, the firm agreed to provide $ 1.80 billion in consumer relief by January 2021. As of December 2019, approximately $ 1.55 billion of such relief was provided. This relief was provided in the form of principal forgiveness for underwater homeowners and distressed borrowers; financing for construction, rehabilitation and preservation of affordable housing; and support for debt restructuring, foreclosure prevention and housing quality improvement programs, as well as land banks.

The firm enters into various derivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including written equity and commodity put options, written currency contracts and interest rate caps, floors and swaptions. These derivatives are risk managed together with derivatives that do not meet the definition of a guarantee, and therefore the amounts in the table above do not reflect the firm&#8217;s overall risk related to derivative activities. Disclosures about derivatives are not required if they may be cash settled and the firm has no basis to conclude it is probable that the counterparties held the underlying instruments at inception of the contract. The firm has concluded that these conditions have been met for certain large, internationally active commercial and investment bank counterparties, central clearing counterparties, hedge funds and certain other counterparties. Accordingly, the firm has not included such contracts in the table above. See Note 7 for information about credit derivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee, which are not included in the table above.

Derivatives are accounted for at fair value and therefore the carrying value is considered the best indication of payment/performance risk for individual contracts. However, the carrying values in the table above exclude the effect of counterparty and cash collateral netting. 

Securities Lending Indemnifications.

The firm, in its capacity as an agency lender, indemnifies most of its securities lending customers against losses incurred in the event that borrowers do not return securities and the collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the securities borrowed. Collateral held by the lenders in connection with securities lending indemnifications was $ 19.14 billion as of December 2019 and $ 28.75 billion as of December 2018. Because the contractual nature of these arrangements requires the firm to obtain collateral with a market value that exceeds the value of the securities lent to the borrower, there is minimal performance risk associated with these guarantees.

Other Financial Guarantees.

In the ordinary course of business, the firm provides other financial guarantees of the obligations of third parties (e.g., standby letters of credit and other guarantees to enable clients to complete transactions and fund-related guarantees). These guarantees represent obligations to make payments to beneficiaries if the guaranteed party fails to fulfill its obligation under a contractual arrangement with that beneficiary.

Guarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts.

The firm has established trusts, including Goldman Sachs Capital I, the APEX Trusts and other entities for the limited purpose of issuing securities to third parties, lending the proceeds to the firm and entering into contractual arrangements with the firm and third parties related to this purpose. The firm does not consolidate these entities. See Note 14 for further information about the transactions involving Goldman Sachs Capital I and the APEX Trusts.

The firm effectively provides for the full and unconditional guarantee of the securities issued by these entities. Timely payment by the firm of amounts due to these entities under the guarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and related contractual arrangements will be sufficient to cover payments due on the securities issued by these entities. 

Management believes that it is unlikely that any circumstances will occur, such as nonperformance on the part of paying agents or other service providers, that would make it necessary for the firm to make payments related to these entities other than those required under the terms of the guarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and related contractual arrangements and in connection with certain expenses incurred by these entities. 

Indemnities and Guarantees of Service Providers.

In the ordinary course of business, the firm indemnifies and guarantees certain service providers, such as clearing and custody agents, trustees and administrators, against specified potential losses in connection with their acting as an agent of, or providing services to, the firm or its affiliates.

The firm may also be liable to some clients or other parties for losses arising from its custodial role or caused by acts or omissions of third-party service providers, including sub-custodians

and third-party brokers. In certain cases, the firm has the right to seek indemnification from these third-party service providers for certain relevant losses incurred by the firm. In addition, the firm is a member of payment, clearing and settlement networks, as well as securities exchanges around the world that may require the firm to meet the obligations of such networks and exchanges in the event of member defaults and other loss scenarios.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

In connection with the firm&#8217;s prime brokerage and clearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear and settle on behalf of its clients the transactions entered into by them with other brokerage firms. The firm&#8217;s obligations in respect of such transactions are secured by the assets in the client&#8217;s account, as well as any proceeds received from the transactions cleared and settled by the firm on behalf of the client. In connection with joint venture investments, the firm may issue loan guarantees under which it may be liable in the event of fraud, misappropriation, environmental liabilities and certain other matters involving the borrower. 

The firm is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees and indemnifications. However, management believes that it is unlikely the firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements, and no material liabilities related to these guarantees and indemnifications have been recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of both December 2019 and December 2018. 

Other Representations, Warranties and Indemnifications.

The firm provides representations and warranties to counterparties in connection with a variety of commercial transactions and occasionally indemnifies them against potential losses caused by the breach of those representations and warranties. The firm may also provide indemnifications protecting against changes in or adverse application of certain U.S. tax laws in connection with ordinary-course transactions, such as securities issuances, borrowings or derivatives.

In addition, the firm may provide indemnifications to some counterparties to protect them in the event additional taxes are owed or payments are withheld, due either to a change in or an adverse application of certain non-U.S.

tax laws.

These indemnifications generally are standard contractual terms and are entered into in the ordinary course of business. Generally, there are no stated or notional amounts included in these indemnifications, and the contingencies triggering the obligation to indemnify are not expected to occur. The firm is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees and indemnifications. However, management believes that it is unlikely the firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements, and no material liabilities related to these arrangements have been recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of both December 2019 and December 2018. 

Guarantees of Subsidiaries.

Group Inc. fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by GS Finance Corp., a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the firm. Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of Goldman Sachs &#38; Co. LLC (GS&#38;Co.) and GS Bank USA, subject to certain exceptions.

Group Inc. guarantees many of the obligations of its other consolidated subsidiaries on a transaction-by-transaction 

basis, as negotiated with counterparties. Group Inc. is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under its subsidiary guarantees; however, because these obligations are also obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, Group Inc.&#8217;s liabilities as guarantor are not separately disclosed.

Note 19. 

Shareholders&#8217; Equity 

Common Equity 

As of both December 2019 and December 2018, the firm had 4.00 billion authorized shares of common stock and 200 million authorized shares of nonvoting common stock, each with a par value of $ 0.01 per share. 

The firm&#8217;s share repurchase program is intended to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. The share repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1),

the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by the firm&#8217;s current and projected capital position, and capital deployment opportunities, but which may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of the firm&#8217;s common stock. Prior to repurchasing common stock, the firm must receive confirmation that the FRB does not object to such capital action.

The table below presents information about common stock repurchases.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Note 20. 

Regulation and Capital Adequacy 

The FRB is the primary regulator of Group Inc., a bank holding company (BHC) under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and a financial holding company under amendments to this Act. The firm is subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements which are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). 

The capital requirements are expressed as risk-based capital and leverage ratios that compare measures of regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets (RWAs), average assets and off-balance-sheet

exposures. Failure to comply with these capital requirements could result in restrictions being imposed by the firm&#8217;s regulators and could limit the firm&#8217;s ability to repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments. The firm&#8217;s capital levels are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings and other factors. Furthermore, certain of the firm&#8217;s subsidiaries are subject to separate regulations and capital requirements.

Capital Framework 

The regulations under the Capital Framework are largely based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision&#8217;s (Basel Committee) capital framework for strengthening international capital standards (Basel III) and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the Capital Framework, the firm is an &#8220;Advanced approach&#8221; banking organization and has been designated as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB). 

The capital requirements calculated in accordance with the Capital Framework include the minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios. In addition, the risk-based capital requirements include the capital conservation buffer, countercyclical capital buffer and the G-SIB

surcharge, all of which must consist entirely of capital that qualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital.

The firm calculates its CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in accordance with (i) the Standardized approach and market risk rules set out in the Capital Framework (together, the Standardized Capital Rules) and (ii) the Advanced approach and market risk rules set out in the Capital Framework (together, the Advanced Capital Rules). The lower of each risk-based capital ratio calculated in (i) and (ii) is the ratio against which the firm&#8217;s compliance with its risk-based capital requirements is assessed. Under the Capital Framework, the firm is also subject to leverage requirements which consist of a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), as well as the SLR buffer. 

Consolidated Regulatory Risk-Based Capital and Leverage Ratios 

The table below presents the risk-based capital and leverage requirements.

##TABLE_START &#8226;

The G-SIB

surcharge is updated annually based on financial data from the prior year and is generally applicable for the following year. The G-SIB

surcharge is calculated using two methodologies, the higher of which is reflected in the firm&#8217;s risk-based capital requirements. The first calculation (Method 1) is based on the Basel Committee&#8217;s methodology which, among other factors, relies upon measures of the size, activity and complexity of each G-SIB.

The second calculation (Method 2) uses similar inputs but includes a measure of reliance on short-term wholesale funding. ##TABLE_END &#160;

RWAs.

RWAs are calculated in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules.

Credit Risk 

Credit RWAs are calculated based on measures of exposure, which are then risk weighted under the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

The Standardized Capital Rules apply prescribed risk-weights, which depend largely on the type of counterparty. The exposure measure for derivatives and securities financing transactions are based on specific formulas which take certain factors into consideration. ##TABLE_END &#160;

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Under the Advanced Capital Rules, the firm computes risk-weights for wholesale and retail credit exposures in accordance with the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based approach. The exposure measures for derivatives and securities financing transactions are computed utilizing internal models. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

For both Standardized and Advanced credit RWAs, the risk-weights for securitizations and equities are based on specific required formulaic approaches. ##TABLE_END 

Market Risk 

RWAs for market risk in accordance with the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules are generally consistent. Market RWAs are calculated based on measures of exposure which include the following: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Value-at-Risk

(VaR) is the potential loss in value of trading assets and liabilities, as well as certain investments, loans, and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. ##TABLE_END 

For both risk management purposes and regulatory capital calculations the firm uses a single VaR model which captures risks including those related to interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. However, VaR used for regulatory capital requirements (regulatory VaR) differs from risk management VaR due to different time horizons and confidence levels ( 10 -day 

and 99 % for regulatory VaR vs. one -day

and 95 % for risk management VaR), as well as differences in the scope of positions on which VaR is calculated. In addition, the daily net revenues used to determine risk management VaR exceptions (i.e., comparing the daily net revenues to the VaR measure calculated as of the end of the prior business day) include intraday activity, whereas the FRB&#8217;s regulatory capital rules require that intraday activity be excluded from daily net revenues when calculating regulatory VaR exceptions. Intraday activity includes bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature. As a result, there may be differences in the number of VaR exceptions and the amount of daily net revenues calculated for regulatory VaR compared to the amounts calculated for risk management VaR.

The firm&#8217;s positional losses observed on a single day exceeded its 99% one-day

regulatory VaR on one occasion during 2019 and exceeded its 99% one-day 

regulatory VaR on two occasions during 2018. There was no change in the VaR multiplier used to calculate Market RWAs;

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Stressed VaR is the potential loss in value of trading assets and liabilities, as well as certain investments, loans, and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, during a period of significant market stress; ##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Incremental risk is the potential loss in value of non-securitized

positions due to the default or credit migration of issuers of financial instruments over a one-year

time horizon; ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Comprehensive risk is the potential loss in value, due to price risk and defaults, within the firm&#8217;s credit correlation positions; and ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

Specific risk is the risk of loss on a position that could result from factors other than broad market movements, including event risk, default risk and idiosyncratic risk. The standardized measurement method is used to determine specific risk RWAs, by applying supervisory defined risk-weighting factors after applicable netting is performed. ##TABLE_END 

Operational Risk 

Operational RWAs are only required to be included under the Advanced Capital Rules. The firm utilizes an internal risk-based model to quantify Operational RWAs. 

The table below presents information about RWAs.

RWAs Rollforward Commentary 

Year Ended December 2019.

Standardized Credit RWAs as of December 2019 increased by $ 25.65 billion compared with December 2018, primarily reflecting an increase in commitments, guarantees and loans, principally due to an increase in lending activity, and an increase in other credit RWAs, principally due to the recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 and an increase in corporate debt exposures. Standardized Market RWAs as of December 2019 decreased by $ 9.98 billion compared with December 2018, primarily reflecting a decrease in specific risk, principally due to reduced exposures, and a decrease in incremental risk, principally due to reduced exposures and changes in risk measurements.

Advanced Credit RWAs as of December 2019 decreased by $ 7.67 billion compared with December 2018. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, the firm made changes to the calculation of the loss given default for certain wholesale exposures which resulted in a decrease in credit RWAs, primarily in commitments, guarantees and loans and derivatives. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in other credit RWAs, principally due to the recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 and an increase in corporate debt exposures. Advanced Market RWAs as of December 2019 decreased by $ 10.19 billion compared with December 2018, primarily reflecting a decrease in specific risk, principally due to reduced exposures, and a decrease in incremental risk, principally due to reduced exposures and changes in risk measurements. Advanced Operational RWAs as of December 2019 increased by $ 4.40 billion compared with December 2018, associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. 

Year Ended December 2018.

Standardized Credit RWAs as of December 2018 increased by $ 5.11 billion compared with December 2017, primarily reflecting an increase in commitments, guarantees and loans, principally due to an increase in lending activity. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in securities financing transactions, principally due to reduced exposures. Standardized Market RWAs as of December 2018 decreased by $ 12.81 billion compared with December 2017, primarily reflecting a decrease in specific risk on positions for which the firm obtained increased transparency into the underliers and as a result utilized a modeled approach to calculate RWAs.

Advanced Credit RWAs as of December 2018 decreased by $ 44.57 billion compared with December 2017. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018, the firm&#8217;s default experience was incorporated into the determination of probability of default, which resulted in a decrease in credit RWAs, primarily in commitments, guarantees and loans and derivatives. Advanced Market RWAs as of December 2018 decreased by $ 12.28 billion compared with December 2017, primarily reflecting a decrease in specific risk on positions for which the firm obtained increased transparency into the underliers and as a result utilized 

a modeled approach to calculate RWAs.

Regulatory Capital Ratios.

GS Bank USA, the firm&#8217;s primary U.S. bank subsidiary, is an FDIC-insured, New York State-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, is supervised and regulated by the FRB, the FDIC, the New York State Department of Financial Services and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

, and is subject to regulatory capital requirements that are calculated in substantially the same manner as those applicable to BHCs. For purposes of assessing the adequacy of its capital, GS Bank USA calculates its risk-based capital and leverage ratios in accordance with the regulatory capital requirements applicable to state member banks. Those requirements are based on the Capital Framework described above. GS Bank USA is an Advanced approach banking organization under the Capital Framework.

Under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action applicable to GS Bank USA, in order to meet the quantitative requirements for being a &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; depository institution, GS Bank USA must also meet the &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; requirements in the table below. 

GS Bank USA&#8217;s capital levels and prompt corrective action classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings and other factors. Failure to comply with these capital requirements, including a breach of the buffers described above, could result in restrictions being imposed by GS Bank USA&#8217;s regulators. 

Similar to the firm, GS Bank USA is required to calculate each of the CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules. The lower of each risk-based capital ratio calculated in accordance with the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules is the ratio against which GS Bank USA&#8217;s compliance with its risk-based capital requirements is assessed. 

The table below presents GS Bank USA&#8217;s risk-based capital, leverage and &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; requirements.

In the table above:

##TABLE_START &#8226;

In accordance with the Capital Rules, the lower of the Standardized or Advanced ratio is the ratio against which GS Bank USA&#8217;s compliance with the capital requirements is assessed, and therefore, the Standardized ratios applied to GS Bank USA as of both December 2019 and December 2018.

Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, GS Bank USA made changes to the calculation of the loss given default for certain wholesale exposures. At the date of adoption, the estimated impact of these changes was an increase in GS Bank USA&#8217;s Advanced CET1 capital ratio of approximately 2.2 percentage points. ##TABLE_END &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226;

The Standardized risk-based capital ratios increased from December 2018 to December 2019, reflecting an increase in capital, principally due to net earnings, partially offset by an increase in credit RWAs. The Advanced risk-based capital ratios increased from December 2018 to December 2019, reflecting a decrease in credit RWAs, principally due to updates to the loss given default calculation for certain wholesale exposures. ##TABLE_END The table below presents information about GS Bank USA&#8217;s leverage ratios.

The firm&#8217;s principal non-U.S.

bank subsidiary, GSIB, is a wholly-owned credit institution, regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority and is subject to regulatory capital requirements. As of both December 2019 and December 2018, GSIB was in compliance with its regulatory capital requirements.

Other.

The deposits of GS Bank USA are insured by the FDIC to the extent provided by law. The FRB requires that GS Bank USA maintain cash reserves with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The amount deposited by GS Bank USA at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was $ 50.55 billion as of December 2019 and $ 29.20 billion as of December 2018, which exceeded required reserve amounts by $ 50.29 billion as of December 2019 and $ 29.03 billion as of December 2018.

Restrictions on Payments 

Group Inc. may be limited in its ability to access capital held at certain subsidiaries as a result of regulatory, tax or other constraints. These limitations include provisions of applicable law and regulations and other regulatory restrictions that limit the ability of those subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends without prior regulatory approval (e.g., dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test) even if the relevant subsidiary would satisfy the equity capital requirements applicable to it after giving effect to the dividend. For example, the FRB, the FDIC and the New York State Department of Financial Services have authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise (including GS Bank USA) if, in the regulator&#8217;s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in the light of the financial condition of the banking organization. 

In addition, 

subsidiaries not subject to separate regulatory capital requirements may hold capital to satisfy local tax and legal guidelines, rating agency requirements (for entities with assigned credit ratings) or internal policies, including policies concerning the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based on its underlying level of risk.

Group Inc.&#8217;s equity investment in subsidiaries was $ 95.68 billion as of December 2019 and $ 90.22 billion as of December 2018, of which Group Inc. was required to maintain $ 57.58 billion as of December 2019 and $ 52.92 billion as of December 2018, of minimum equity capital in its regulated subsidiaries in order to satisfy the regulatory requirements of such subsidiaries. 

Group Inc.&#8217;s capital invested in certain non-U.S. 

subsidiaries is exposed to foreign exchange risk, substantially all of which is managed through a combination of derivatives and non-U.S.

denominated debt. See Note 7 for information about the firm&#8217;s net investment hedges used to hedge this risk.

Note 21. 

Earnings Per Common Share 

Basic earnings per common share (EPS) is calculated by dividing net earnings to common by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and restricted stock units (RSUs) for which the delivery of the underlying common stock is not subject to satisfaction of future service or performance conditions (collectively, basic shares). Diluted EPS includes the determinants of basic EPS and, in addition, reflects the dilutive effect of the common stock deliverable for stock options and for RSUs for which the delivery of the underlying common stock is subject to satisfaction of future service or performance conditions.

The table below presents information about basic and diluted EPS.

Unvested share-based awards that have non-forfeitable 

rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are treated as a separate class of securities under the two-class method.

The impact of applying this methodology was a reduction in basic EPS of $ 0.07 for 2019, $ 0.05 for 2018 and $ 0.06 for 2017. ##TABLE_END

The firm may periodically determine to waive certain management fees on selected money market funds. Management fees waived were $ 44 million for 2019 and $ 51 million for 2018 and $ 98 million for 2017. 

The Volcker Rule restricts the firm from providing financial support to covered funds (as defined in the rule) after the expiration of the conformance period. As a general matter, in the ordinary course of business, the firm does not expect to provide additional voluntary financial support to any covered funds, but may choose to do so with respect to funds that are not subject to the Volcker Rule. However, in the event that such support is provided, the amount is not expected to be material. 

The firm had an outstanding guarantee, as permitted under the Volcker Rule, on behalf of its funds of $ 87 million as of December 2019 and $ 154 million as of December 2018. The firm has voluntarily provided this guarantee in connection with a financing agreement with a third-party lender executed by one of the firm&#8217;s real estate funds that is not covered by the Volcker Rule. As of both December 2019 and December 2018, except as noted above, the firm has not provided any additional financial support to its affiliated funds. 

In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the firm may also engage in other activities with its affiliated funds including, among others, securities lending, trade execution, market-making, custody, and acquisition and bridge financing. See Note 18 for the firm&#8217;s investment commitments related to these funds.

Deferred Income Taxes 

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. These temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years and are measured using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that more likely than not will be realized and primarily relate to the ability to utilize losses in various tax jurisdictions. Tax assets are included in other assets and tax liabilities are included in other liabilities. 

The table below presents information about deferred tax assets and liabilities, excluding the impact of netting within tax jurisdictions.

The firm has recorded deferred tax assets of $ 411 million as of December 2019 and $ 688 million as of December 2018, in connection with U.S. federal, state and local and foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The firm also recorded a valuation allowance of $ 79 million as of December 2019 and $ 81 million as of December 2018, related to these net operating loss carryforwards. 

As of December 2019, the U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward was $ 327 million, the state and local net operating loss carryforward was $ 1.46 billion, and the foreign net operating loss carryforward was $ 1.24 billion. If not utilized, the U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward will begin to expire in 2025 and the state and local, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2020 . If these carryforwards expire, they will not have a material impact on the firm&#8217;s results of operations. As of December 2019, the firm has recorded deferred tax assets of $ 5 million in connection with general business credit carryforwards and $ 29 million in connection with state and local tax credit carryforwards. If not utilized, the general business credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2021 and the state and local tax credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2020 . As of December 2019, the firm did not have any foreign tax credit carryforwards. 

As of both December 2019 and December 2018, the firm had no U.S. capital loss carryforwards and no related net deferred income tax assets. As of December 2019, the firm had deferred tax assets of $ 181 million in connection with foreign capital loss carryforwards and a valuation allowance of $ 181 million related to these capital loss carryforwards. 

The valuation allowance increased by $ 222 million during 2019 and increased by $ 89 million during 2018. The increases in both 2019 and 2018 were primarily due to an increase in deferred tax assets from which the firm does not expect to realize any benefit. 

The firm permanently reinvested eligible earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. As of both December 2019 and December 2018, all U.S. taxes were accrued on these subsidiaries&#8217; distributable earnings, substantially all of which resulted from the Tax Legislation repatriation tax and GILTI. 

Unrecognized Tax Benefits 

The firm recognizes tax positions in the consolidated financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized on settlement. A liability is established for differences between positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

The accrued liability for interest expense related to income tax matters and income tax penalties was $ 198 million as of December 2019 and $ 107 million as of December 2018. The firm recognized interest expense and income tax penalties of $ 60 million for 2019, $ 18 million for 2018 and $ 63 million for 2017. It is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits could change significantly during the twelve months subsequent to December 2019 due to potential audit settlements. However, at this time it is not possible to estimate any potential change. 

The table below presents the changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which is included in other liabilities.

Regulatory Tax Examinations 

The firm is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing authorities in jurisdictions where the firm has significant business operations, such as the United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong and various states, such as New York. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. The firm does not expect completion of these audits to have a material impact on the firm&#8217;s financial condition, but it may be material to operating results for a particular period, depending, in part, on the operating results for that period. 

The table below presents the earliest tax years that remain subject to examination by major jurisdiction.

U.S. Federal examinations of 2011 and 2012 began in 2013. The firm has been accepted into the Compliance Assurance Process program by the IRS for each of the tax years from 2013 through 2019 and submitted an application for 2020. This program allows the firm to work with the IRS to identify and resolve potential U.S. Federal tax issues before the filing of tax returns. The 2013 through 2018 tax years remain subject to post-filing review. 

New York State and City examinations (excluding GS Bank USA) of 2011 through 2014 began in 2017. New York State and City examinations for GS Bank USA have been completed through 2014. 

All years including and subsequent to the years in the table above remain open to examination by the taxing authorities. The firm believes that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits it has established is adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. 

Note 25. 

Business Segments 

The firm reports its activities in the following four business segments: Investment Banking, Global Markets, Asset Management and Consumer &#38; Wealth Management. See Note 1 for information about the firm&#8217;s business segments. 

Compensation and benefits expenses in the firm&#8217;s segments reflect, among other factors, the overall performance of the firm, as well as the performance of individual businesses. Consequently, pre-tax

margins in one segment of the firm&#8217;s business may be significantly affected by the performance of the firm&#8217;s other business segments.

The firm allocates assets (including allocations of global core liquid assets and cash, secured client financing and other assets), revenues and expenses among the four business segments. Due to the integrated nature of these segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses. The allocation process is based on the manner in which management currently views the performance of the segments.

The allocation of common shareholders&#8217; equity and preferred stock dividends to each segment is based on the estimated amount of 

equity required to support the activities of the segment under relevant regulatory capital requirements. 

Net earnings for each segment is calculated by applying the firmwide tax rate to each segment&#8217;s pre-tax earnings. 

Management believes that this allocation provides a reasonable representation of each segment&#8217;s contribution to consolidated net earnings to common, return on average common equity and total assets. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates.

Geographic results are generally allocated as follows:

Note 26. 

Credit Concentrations 

The firm&#8217;s concentrations of credit risk arise from its market making, client facilitation, investing, underwriting, lending and collateralized transactions, and cash management activities, and may be impacted by changes in economic, industry or political factors. These activities expose the firm to many different industries and counterparties, and may also subject the firm to a concentration of credit risk to a particular central bank, counterparty, borrower or issuer, including sovereign issuers, or to a particular clearing house or exchange. The firm seeks to mitigate credit risk by actively monitoring exposures and obtaining collateral from counterparties as deemed appropriate. 

The firm measures and monitors its credit exposure based on amounts owed to the firm after taking into account risk mitigants that management considers when determining credit risk. Such risk mitigants include netting and collateral arrangements and economic hedges, such as credit derivatives, futures and forward contracts. Netting and collateral agreements permit the firm to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties and/or enable the firm to obtain collateral on an upfront or contingent basis. 

The table below presents the credit concentrations included in trading cash instruments and investments.

Legal Proceedings 

The firm is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings (including those described below) concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of the firm&#8217;s businesses. Many of these proceedings are in early stages, and many of these cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages. 

Under ASC 450, an event is &#8220;reasonably possible&#8221; if &#8220;the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely&#8221; and an event is &#8220;remote&#8221; if &#8220;the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.&#8221; Thus, references to the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss for cases in which the firm is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss mean the upper end of the range of loss for cases for which the firm believes the risk of loss is more than slight.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

With respect to matters described below for which management has been able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss where (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have claimed an amount of money damages, (ii) the firm is being, or threatened to be, sued by purchasers in a securities offering and is not being indemnified by a party that the firm believes will pay the full amount of any judgment, or (iii) the purchasers are demanding that the firm repurchase securities, management has estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss as being equal to (a) in the case of (i), the amount of money damages claimed, (b) in the case of (ii), the difference between the initial sales price of the securities that the firm sold in such offering and the estimated lowest subsequent price of such securities prior to the action being commenced and (c) in the case of (iii), the price that purchasers paid for the securities less the estimated value, if any, as of December 2019 of the relevant securities, in each of cases (i), (ii) and (iii), taking into account any other factors believed to be relevant to the particular matter or matters of that type. As of the date hereof, the firm has estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss for such matters and for any other matters described below where management has been able to estimate a range of reasonably possible aggregate loss to be approximately $ 3.3 billion in excess of the aggregate reserves for such matters. 

Management is generally unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for matters other than those included in the estimate above, including where (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have not claimed an amount of money damages, except in those instances where management can otherwise determine an appropriate amount, (ii) matters are in early stages, (iii) matters relate to regulatory investigations or reviews, except in those instances where management can otherwise determine an appropriate amount, (iv) there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (v) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, (vi) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, and/or (vii) there are novel legal issues presented. For example, the firm&#8217;s potential liabilities with respect to the investigations and reviews described below in &#8220;Regulatory Investigations and Reviews and Related Litigation&#8221; generally are not included in management&#8217;s estimate of reasonably possible loss. However, management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcomes of such other matters will have a material adverse effect on the firm&#8217;s financial condition, though the outcomes could be material to the firm&#8217;s operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period. See Note 18 for further information about mortgage-related contingencies. 

1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB)-Related Matters 

The firm has received subpoenas and requests for documents and information from various governmental and regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations as part of investigations and reviews relating to financing transactions and other matters involving 1MDB, a sovereign wealth fund in Malaysia. Subsidiaries of the firm acted as arrangers or purchasers of approximately $ 6.5 billion of debt securities of 1MDB. 

On November 1, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed a criminal information and guilty plea by Tim Leissner, a former participating managing director of the firm, and an indictment against Ng Chong Hwa, a former managing director of the firm, and Low Taek Jho. Leissner pleaded guilty to a two-count

criminal information charging him with conspiring to launder money and conspiring to violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act&#8217;s (FCPA) anti-bribery and internal accounting controls provisions. Low and Ng were charged in a three-count indictment with conspiring to launder money and conspiring to violate the FCPA&#8217;s anti-bribery provisions. On August 28, 2018, Leissner&#8217;s guilty plea was accepted by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York and Leissner was adjudicated guilty on both counts. Ng was also charged in this indictment with conspiring to violate the FCPA&#8217;s internal accounting controls provisions. The charging documents state, among other things, that Leissner and Ng participated in a conspiracy to misappropriate proceeds of the 1MDB offerings for themselves and to pay bribes to various government officials to obtain and retain 1MDB business for the firm. The plea and charging documents indicate that Leissner and Ng knowingly and willfully circumvented the firm&#8217;s system of internal accounting controls, in part by repeatedly lying to control personnel and internal committees that reviewed these offerings. The indictment of Ng and Low alleges that the firm&#8217;s system of internal accounting controls could be easily circumvented and that the firm&#8217;s business culture, particularly in Southeast Asia, at times prioritized consummation of deals ahead of the proper operation of its compliance functions. On May 6, 2019, Ng pleaded not guilty to the DOJ&#8217;s criminal charges. On February 4, 2020, the FRB disclosed that Andrea Vella, a former participating managing director whom the DOJ had previously referred to as an unindicted co-conspirator,

had agreed, without admitting or denying the FRB&#8217;s allegations, to a consent order that prohibited him from participating in the banking industry. No other penalties were imposed by the consent order.

On December 17, 2018, the Attorney General of Malaysia filed criminal charges in Malaysia against Goldman Sachs International (GSI), as the arranger of three offerings of debt securities of 1MDB, aggregating approximately $ 6.5 billion in principal amount, for alleged disclosure deficiencies in the offering documents relating to, among other things, the use of proceeds for the debt securities, as well as against Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC (GS Asia) and Goldman Sachs (Singapore) PTE (GS Singapore). Criminal charges have also been filed against Leissner, Low, Ng and Jasmine Loo Ai Swan. In a related press release, the Attorney General of Malaysia indicated that prosecutors in Malaysia will seek criminal fines against the accused in excess of $ 2.7 billion plus the $ 600 million of fees received in connection with the debt offerings. On August 9, 2019, the Attorney General of Malaysia announced that criminal charges had also been filed against seventeen current and former directors of GSI, GS Asia and GS Singapore. 

The Malaysia Securities Commission issued notices to show cause against Goldman Sachs (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (GS Malaysia) in December 2018 and March 2019 that (i) allege possible violations of Malaysian securities laws and (ii) indicate that the Malaysia Securities Commission is considering whether to revoke GS Malaysia&#8217;s license to conduct corporate finance and fund management activities in Malaysia. 

The firm has received multiple demands, beginning in November 2018, from alleged shareholders under Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law for books and records relating to, among other things, the firm&#8217;s involvement with 1MDB and the firm&#8217;s compliance procedures. On December 13, 2019, an alleged shareholder filed a lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware seeking books and records relating to, among other things, the firm&#8217;s involvement with 1MDB and the firm&#8217;s compliance procedures. 

On February 19, 2019, a purported shareholder derivative action relating to 1MDB was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Group Inc. and the directors at the time and a former chairman and chief executive officer of the firm. The amended complaint filed on July 12, 2019, which seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement and injunctive relief, alleges breaches of fiduciary duties, including in connection with alleged insider trading by certain current and former directors, unjust enrichment and violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act, including in connection with Group Inc.&#8217;s common stock repurchases and solicitation of proxies. Defendants moved to dismiss this action on September 12, 2019. 

Beginning in March 2019, the firm has also received demands from alleged shareholders to investigate and pursue claims against certain current and former directors and executive officers based on their oversight and public disclosures regarding 1MDB and related internal controls. 

On November 21, 2018, a summons with notice was filed in New York Supreme Court, County of New York, by International Petroleum Investment Company, which guaranteed certain debt securities issued by 1MDB, and its subsidiary Aabar Investments PJS. The summons with notice makes unspecified claims relating to 1MDB and seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages and other 

relief against Group Inc., GSI, GS Asia, GS Singapore, GS Malaysia, Leissner, Ng, and Vella, as well as individuals (who are not current or former employees of the firm) previously associated with the plaintiffs. 

On December 20, 2018, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Group Inc. and certain former officers of the firm alleging violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act with respect to Group Inc.&#8217;s disclosures concerning 1MDB and seeking unspecified damages. The plaintiffs filed the second amended complaint on October 28, 2019, which the defendants moved to dismiss on January 9, 2020. 

The firm is cooperating with the DOJ and all other governmental and regulatory investigations relating to 1MDB. The firm is also engaged in discussions with certain governmental and regulatory authorities with respect to potential resolution of their investigations and proceedings. There can be no assurance that the discussions will lead to resolution of any of those matters. Any such resolution, as well as proceedings by the DOJ or other governmental or regulatory authorities, could result in the imposition of significant fines, penalties and other sanctions against the firm, including restrictions on the firm&#8217;s activities. 

Mortgage-Related Matters 

Beginning in April 2010, a number of purported securities law class actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York challenging the adequacy of Group Inc.&#8217;s public disclosure of, among other things, the firm&#8217;s activities in the collateralized debt obligation market, and the firm&#8217;s conflict of interest management.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

The consolidated amended complaint filed on July 25, 2011, which names as defendants Group Inc. and certain current and former officers and employees of Group Inc. and its affiliates, generally alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and seeks unspecified damages. The defendants have moved for summary judgment. On December 11, 2018, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals granted the defendants&#8217; petition for interlocutory review of the district court&#8217;s August 14, 2018 grant of class certification. On January 23, 2019, the district court stayed proceedings pending the appellate court&#8217;s decision. 

Beginning on February 15, 2019, a summons with notice and a complaint were filed against Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company and GS Mortgage Securities Corp. by U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee for two residential mortgage-backed securitization trusts that issued $ 1.7 billion of securities, and the cases are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The summons with notice and complaint generally allege that mortgage loans in the trusts failed to conform to applicable representations and warranties and seek specific performance or, alternatively, compensatory damages and other relief. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on September 23, 2019. 

The firm continues to receive requests for information, including from certain regulators, relating to mortgage-related activities. 

Director Compensation-Related Litigation 

On May 9, 2017, Group Inc. and certain of its current and former directors were named as defendants in a purported direct and derivative shareholder action in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (a similar purported derivative action, filed in June 2015, alleging excessive director compensation over the period 2012 to 2014 was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice in December 2016). The complaint alleges that excessive compensation has been paid to the non-employee

director defendants since 2015, and that certain disclosures in connection with soliciting shareholder approval of the stock incentive plans were deficient. The complaint asserts claims for breaches of fiduciary duties and seeks, among other things, rescission or in some cases rescissory damages, disgorgement, and shareholder votes on several matters. On October 23, 2018, the court declined to approve the parties&#8217; proposed settlement. On May 31, 2019, the court dismissed the disclosure-related claims, but permitted the non-employee

director compensation claim to proceed.

Currencies-Related Litigation 

GS&#38;Co. and Group Inc. are among the defendants named in putative class actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York beginning in September 2016 on behalf of putative indirect purchasers of foreign exchange instruments. On August 5, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a third consolidated amended complaint generally alleging a conspiracy to manipulate the foreign currency exchange markets, asserting claims under various state antitrust laws and state consumer protection laws and seeking treble damages in an unspecified amount. 

GS&#38;Co. and Group Inc. are among the defendants named in an action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on November 7, 2018 by certain direct purchasers of foreign exchange instruments that opted out of a class settlement reached with, among others, GS&#38;Co. and Group Inc. The second amended complaint, filed on June 11, 2019, generally alleges that the defendants violated federal antitrust law and state common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to manipulate the foreign currency exchange markets and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as unspecified amounts of compensatory, punitive, treble and other damages. Defendants moved to dismiss on July 25, 2019. 

Financial Advisory Services 

Group Inc. and certain of its affiliates are from time to time parties to various civil litigation and arbitration proceedings and other disputes with clients and third parties relating to the firm&#8217;s financial advisory activities.

Employee Benefit Plans 

The firm sponsors various pension plans and certain other postretirement benefit plans, primarily healthcare and life insurance. The firm also provides certain benefits to former or inactive employees prior to retirement. 

Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Postretirement Plans 

Employees of certain non-U.S.

subsidiaries participate in various defined benefit pension plans. These plans generally provide benefits based on years of credited service and a percentage of eligible compensation. The firm maintains a defined benefit pension plan for certain U.K. employees. As of April 2008, the U.K. defined benefit plan was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants as of March 31, 2016. The non-U.S.

plans do not have a material impact on the firm&#8217;s consolidated results of operations.

The firm also maintains a defined benefit pension plan for substantially all U.S. employees hired prior to November 1, 2003. As of November 2004, this plan was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants. In addition, the firm maintains unfunded postretirement benefit plans that provide medical and life insurance for eligible retirees and their dependents covered under these programs. These plans do not have a material impact on the firm&#8217;s consolidated results of operations. 

The firm recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation, in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 2019, other assets included $ 257 million (related to overfunded pension plans) and other liabilities included $ 415 million, related to these plans. As of December 2018, other assets included $ 462 million (related to overfunded pension plans) and other liabilities included $ 344 million, related to these plans. 

Defined Contribution Plans 

The firm contributes to employer-sponsored U.S. and non-U.S.

defined contribution plans. The firm&#8217;s contribution to these plans was $ 254 million for 2019, $ 240 million for 2018 and $ 257 million for 2017.

Note 29. 

Employee Incentive Plans 

The cost of employee services received in exchange for a share-based award is generally measured based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Share-based awards that do not require future service (i.e., vested awards, including awards granted to retirement-eligible employees) are expensed immediately. Share-based awards that require future service are amortized over the relevant service period. Forfeitures are recorded when they occur.

Cash dividend equivalents paid on RSUs are charged to retained earnings. If RSUs that require future service are forfeited, the related dividend equivalents originally charged to retained earnings are reclassified to compensation expense in the period in which forfeiture occurs.

The firm generally issues new shares of common stock upon delivery of share-based awards. In certain cases, primarily related to conflicted employment (as outlined in the applicable award agreements), the firm may cash settle share-based compensation awards accounted for as equity instruments. For these awards, whose terms allow for cash settlement, additional paid-in

capital is adjusted to the extent of the difference between the value of the award at the time of cash settlement and the grant-date value of the award.

Stock Incentive Plan 

The firm sponsors a stock incentive plan, The Goldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (2018) (2018 SIP), which provides for grants of RSUs, restricted stock, dividend equivalent rights, incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other share-based awards, each of which may be subject to performance conditions. On May 2, 2018, shareholders approved the 2018 SIP. The 2018 SIP replaced The Goldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (2015) (2015 SIP) previously in effect, and applies to awards granted on or after the date of approval. The 2015 SIP had previously replaced The Goldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (2013) (2013 SIP). 

As of December 2019, 60.6 million shares were available for grant under the 2018 SIP. If any shares of common stock underlying awards granted under the 2018 SIP, 2015 SIP or 2013 SIP are not delivered due to forfeiture, termination or cancellation or are surrendered or withheld, those shares will become available to be delivered under the 2018 SIP. Shares available for grant are also subject to adjustment for certain changes in corporate structure as permitted under the 2018 SIP. The 2018 SIP is scheduled to terminate on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders that occurs in 2022.

Restricted Stock Units 

The firm grants RSUs (including RSUs subject to performance conditions) to employees, which are generally valued based on the closing price of the underlying shares on the date of grant after taking into account a liquidity discount for any applicable post-vesting and delivery transfer restrictions. RSUs generally vest and underlying shares of common stock deliver (net of required withholding tax) as outlined in the applicable award agreements. Award agreements generally provide that vesting is accelerated in certain circumstances, such as on retirement, death, disability and conflicted employment. Delivery of the underlying shares of common stock, which generally occurs over a three-year period, is conditioned on the grantees satisfying certain vesting and other requirements outlined in the award agreements. 

The table below presents the 2019 activity related to RSUs.

In relation to 2019 year-end,

during the first quarter of 2020, the firm granted to its employees 8.3 million RSUs, of which 2.9 million RSUs require future service as a condition of delivery for the related shares of common stock. These awards are subject to additional conditions as outlined in the award agreements. Generally, shares underlying these awards, net of required withholding tax, deliver over a three-year period, but are subject to post-vesting and delivery transfer restrictions through January 2025 . These grants are not included in the table above.

As of December 2019, there was $ 467 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested 

share-based compensation arrangements. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.79 years.

Stock Options 

Stock options generally vested as outlined in the applicable stock option agreement. In general, options expired on the tenth anniversary of the grant date, although they may have been subject to earlier termination or cancellation under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the applicable stock option agreement and the SIP in effect at the time of grant. 

There were no options outstanding as of both December 2019 and December 2018. 

During 2019, no options were exercised. During 2018, 2.10 million options were exercised with a weighted average exercise price of $ 78.78 . The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 288 million during 2018 and $ 589 million during 2017.

##TABLE_END &#160;

Cross-border Outstandings 

Cross-border outstandings are based on the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council&#8217;s (FFIEC) guidelines for reporting cross-border information and represent the amounts that the firm may not be able to obtain from a foreign country due to country-specific events, including unfavorable economic and political conditions, economic and social instability, and changes in government policies. 

Credit exposure represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty or an issuer of securities or other instruments and is measured based on the potential loss in an event of non-payment

by a counterparty. Credit exposure is reduced through the effect of risk mitigants, such as netting agreements with counterparties that permit the firm to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties or obtaining collateral from counterparties. The table below does not include all the effects of such risk mitigants and does not represent the firm&#8217;s credit exposure.

The table below presents cross-border outstandings and commitments for each country in which cross-border outstandings exceed 0.75% of consolidated assets in accordance with the FFIEC guidelines.
