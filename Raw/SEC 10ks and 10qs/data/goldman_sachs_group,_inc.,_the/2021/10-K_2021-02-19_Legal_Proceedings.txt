 Item 3. Legal Proceedings 

We are involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our businesses. Many of these proceedings are in early stages, and many of these cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages. We have estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss for matters where we have been able to estimate a range and we believe, based on currently available information, that the results of matters where we have not been able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but may be material to our operating results in a given period. Given the range of litigation and investigations presently under way, our litigation expenses may remain high. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Use of Estimates&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.

See Notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K

for information about our reasonably possible aggregate loss estimate and judicial, regulatory and legal proceedings.
