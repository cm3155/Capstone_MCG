 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 

Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (the firm), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The firm&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the firm&#8217;s principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the firm&#8217;s financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

As of December 31, 2021, management conducted an assessment of the firm&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management has determined that the firm&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 was effective. 

Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the firm; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the firm&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. 

The firm&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PCAOB ID 238 ), an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on pages 118 to 120, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the firm&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.: 

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of changes in shareholders&#8217; equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). We also have audited the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8212; Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the COSO. 

Change in Accounting Principle 

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020. 

Basis for Opinions 

The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing on page 117. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Valuation of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments 

As described in Notes 4 through 10 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2021, the Company carries financial instruments at fair value, which includes $24.1 billion of financial assets and $29.2 billion of financial liabilities classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, as one or more inputs to the financial instrument&#8217;s valuation technique are significant and unobservable. Significant unobservable inputs used by management to value certain of these Level 3 financial instruments included (i) industry multiples and public comparables, (ii) credit spreads or (iii) correlation. 

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of these certain Level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in valuing the financial instruments, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the aforementioned significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of certain Level 3 financial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of financial instruments, including controls over the methods and significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of certain Level 3 financial instruments. These procedures also included, among others, for a sample of financial instruments, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in (i) developing an independent estimate of fair value or (ii) testing management&#8217;s process to determine the fair value of these financial instruments. Developing the independent estimate involved (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management, (ii) evaluating and utilizing management&#8217;s significant unobservable inputs or developing independent significant unobservable inputs, and (iii) comparing management&#8217;s estimate to the independently developed estimate of fair value. Testing management&#8217;s process included evaluating the reasonableness of the aforementioned significant unobservable inputs, evaluating the appropriateness of the techniques used, and testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by management to determine the fair value of these instruments.

Allowance for Loan Losses &#8212; Wholesale Loan Portfolio 

&#160;

As described in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio reflects management&#8217;s estimate of loan losses over the remaining expected life of the loans and also considers forecasts of future economic conditions. As of December 31, 2021, $2.1 billion of the allowance for loan losses and $131.6 billion of the loans accounted for at amortized cost related to the wholesale loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and asset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. In addition, it includes qualitative components to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk. The wholesale models determine the probability of default and loss given default based on various risk factors, including internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators, the borrower&#8217;s capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower&#8217;s country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. The most significant inputs to the forecast model for wholesale loans include forecasted U.S. unemployment rates, GDP, credit spreads, commercial and industrial delinquency rates, short- and long-term interest rates, and oil prices. 

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in the determinations of internal credit ratings and the forecasted U.S. unemployment rates, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management&#8217;s determinations, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. 

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company&#8217;s allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio, including controls over the model, certain data, and significant assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management&#8217;s process for estimating the allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio using a modeled approach, which involved evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology and testing the completeness and accuracy of certain data used in estimating the allowance for loan losses. The procedures also involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the model and methodology and (ii) the reasonableness of the internal credit ratings and the forecasted U.S. unemployment rates used in estimating the allowance for loan losses for the wholesale loan portfolio.

Consolidation 

The firm consolidates entities in which the firm has a controlling financial interest. The firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity (VIE). 

Voting Interest Entities.

Voting interest entities are entities in which (i) the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities independently and (ii) the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If the firm has a controlling majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity is consolidated. 

Variable Interest Entities.

A VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. The firm has a controlling financial interest in a VIE when the firm has a variable interest or interests that provide it with (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE&#8217;s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for further information about VIEs. 

Equity-Method Investments.

When the firm does not have a controlling financial interest in an entity but can exert significant influence over the entity&#8217;s operating and financial policies, the investment is generally accounted for at fair value by electing the fair value option available under U.S. GAAP. Significant influence generally exists when the firm owns 20% to 50% of the entity&#8217;s common stock or in-substance

common stock. 

In certain cases, the firm applies the equity method of accounting to new investments that are strategic in nature or closely related to the firm&#8217;s principal business activities, when the firm has a significant degree of involvement in the cash flows or operations of the investee or when cost-benefit considerations are less significant. See Note 8 for further information about equity-method investments.

&#160;

Investment Funds.

The firm has formed investment funds with third-party investors. These funds are typically organized as limited partnerships or limited liability companies for which the firm acts as general partner or manager. Generally, the firm does not hold a majority of the economic interests in these funds. These funds are usually voting interest entities and generally are not consolidated because third-party investors typically have rights to terminate the funds or to remove the firm as general partner or manager. Investments in these funds are generally measured at net asset value (NAV) and are included in investments. See Notes 8, 18 and 22 for further information about investments in funds. 

Use of Estimates 

Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions, the most important of which relate to fair value measurements, the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost, accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and accounting for income taxes. These estimates and assumptions are based on the best available information but actual results could be materially different. 

Revenue Recognition 

Financial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value.

Trading assets and liabilities and certain investments are carried at fair value either under the fair value option or in accordance with other U.S. GAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to account for certain of its loans and other financial assets and liabilities at fair value by electing the fair value option. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. Fair value gains or losses are generally included in market making or other principal transactions. See Note 4 for further information about fair value measurements. 

Revenue from Contracts with Clients.

The firm recognizes revenue earned from contracts with clients for services, such as investment banking, investment management, and execution and clearing (contracts with clients), when the performance obligations related to the underlying transaction are completed. 

Revenues from contracts with clients represent approximately 45 % of total non-interest

revenues for both 2021 and 2020 (including approximately 90 % of investment banking revenues, approximately 95 % of investment management revenues and all commissions and fees), and approximately 45 % of total non-interest revenues for 2019 (including approximately 85 % of investment banking revenues, approximately 95 % of investment management revenues and all commissions and fees). See Note 25 for information about net revenues by business segment. 

Investment Banking 

Advisory.

Fees from financial advisory assignments are recognized in revenues when the services related to the underlying transaction are completed under the terms of the assignment. Non-refundable

deposits and milestone payments in connection with financial advisory assignments are recognized in revenues upon completion of the underlying transaction or when the assignment is otherwise concluded. 

Expenses associated with financial advisory assignments are recognized when incurred and are included in transaction based expenses. Client reimbursements for such expenses are included in investment banking revenues. 

Underwriting.

Fees from underwriting assignments are recognized in revenues upon completion of the underlying transaction based on the terms of the assignment. 

Expenses associated with underwriting assignments are generally deferred until the related revenue is recognized or the assignment is otherwise concluded. Such expenses are included in transaction based expenses for completed assignments.

&#160;

Investment Management 

The firm earns management fees and incentive fees for investment management services, which are included in investment management revenues. The firm makes payments to brokers and advisors related to the placement of the firm&#8217;s investment funds (distribution fees), which are included in transaction based expenses. 

Management Fees.

Management fees for mutual funds are calculated as a percentage of daily net asset value and are received monthly. Management fees for hedge funds and separately managed accounts are calculated as a percentage of month-end

net asset value and are generally received quarterly. Management fees for private equity funds are calculated as a percentage of monthly invested capital or committed capital and are received quarterly, semi-annually or annually, depending on the fund. Management fees are recognized over time in the period the services are provided. 

Distribution fees paid by the firm are calculated based on either a percentage of the management fee, the investment fund&#8217;s net asset value or the committed capital. Such fees are included in transaction based expenses. 

Incentive Fees.

Incentive fees are calculated as a percentage of a fund&#8217;s or separately managed account&#8217;s return, or excess return above a specified benchmark or other performance target. Incentive fees are generally based on investment performance over a twelve-month period or over the life of a fund. Fees that are based on performance over a twelve-month period are subject to adjustment prior to the end of the measurement period. For fees that are based on investment performance over the life of the fund, future investment underperformance may require fees previously distributed to the firm to be returned to the fund. 

Incentive fees earned from a fund or separately managed account are recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur, which is generally when such fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the market value of investments held by the fund or separately managed account. Therefore, incentive fees recognized during the period may relate to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods. 

Commissions and Fees 

The firm earns commissions and fees from executing and clearing client transactions on stock, options and futures markets, as well as over-the-counter

(OTC) transactions. Commissions and fees are recognized on the day the trade is executed. The firm also provides third-party research services to clients in connection with certain soft-dollar arrangements. Third-party research costs incurred by the firm in connection with such arrangements are presented net within commissions and fees. 

Remaining Performance Obligations 

Remaining performance obligations are services that the firm has committed to perform in the future in connection with its contracts with clients. The firm&#8217;s remaining performance obligations are generally related to its financial advisory assignments and certain investment management activities. Revenues associated with remaining performance obligations relating to financial advisory assignments cannot be determined until the outcome of the transaction. For the firm&#8217;s investment management activities, where fees are calculated based on the net asset value of the fund or separately managed account, future revenues associated with such remaining performance obligations cannot be determined as such fees are subject to fluctuations in the market value of investments held by the fund or separately managed account. 

The firm is able to determine the future revenues associated with management fees calculated based on committed capital. As of December 2021, substantially all future net revenues associated with such remaining performance obligations will be recognized through 2029. Annual revenues associated with such performance obligations average less than $ 250 million through 2029. 

Transfers of Financial Assets 

Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when the firm has relinquished control over the assets transferred. For transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales, any gains or losses are recognized in net revenues. Assets or liabilities that arise from the firm&#8217;s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets are initially recognized at fair value. For transfers of financial assets that are not accounted for as sales, the assets are generally included in trading assets and the transfer is accounted for as a collateralized financing, with the related interest expense recognized over the life of the transaction. See Note 11 for further information about transfers of financial assets accounted for as collateralized financings and Note 16 for further information about transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales.

&#160;

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The firm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid overnight deposits held in the ordinary course of business. Cash and cash equivalents included cash and due from banks of $ 10.14 billion as of December 2021 and $ 11.95 billion as of December 2020. Cash and cash equivalents also included interest-bearing deposits with banks of $ 250.90 billion as of December 2021 and $ 143.89 billion as of December 2020. 

The firm segregates cash for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity. Cash and cash equivalents segregated for regulatory and other purposes were $ 24.87 billion as of December 2021 and $ 24.52 billion as of December 2020. In addition, the firm segregates securities for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity. See Note 11 for further information about segregated securities. 

Customer and Other Receivables 

Customer and other receivables included receivables from customers and counterparties of $ 103.82 billion as of December 2021 and $ 82.39 billion as of December 2020, and receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations of $ 56.85 billion as of December 2021 and $ 38.94 billion as of December 2020. Such receivables primarily consist of customer margin loans, receivables resulting from unsettled transactions and collateral posted in connection with certain derivative transactions. 

Substantially all of these receivables are accounted for at amortized cost net of any allowance for credit losses, which generally approximates fair value. As these receivables are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these receivables been included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2021 and December 2020. See Note 10 for further information about customer and other receivables accounted for at fair value under the fair value option. Interest on customer and other receivables is recognized over the life of the transaction and included in interest income. 

Customer and other receivables includes receivables from contracts with clients and contract assets. Contract assets represent the firm&#8217;s right to receive consideration for services provided in connection with its contracts with clients for which collection is conditional and not merely subject to the passage of time. The firm&#8217;s receivables from contracts with clients were $ 3.01 billion as of December 2021 and $ 2.60 billion as of December 2020. As of both December 2021 and December 2020 contract assets were not material. 

Customer and Other Payables 

Customer and other payables included payables to customers and counterparties of $ 241.93 billion as of December 2021 and $ 183.57 billion as of December 2020, and payables to brokers, dealers and clearing organizations of $ 10.00 billion as of December 2021 and $ 7.09 billion as of December 2020. Such payables primarily consist of customer credit balances related to the firm&#8217;s prime brokerage activities. Customer and other payables are accounted for at cost plus accrued interest, which generally approximates fair value. As these payables are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these payables been included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2021 and December 2020. Interest on customer and other payables is recognized over the life of the transaction and included in interest expense. 

Offsetting Assets and Liabilities 

To reduce credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, the firm may enter into master netting agreements or similar arrangements (collectively, netting agreements) with counterparties that permit it to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. A netting agreement is a contract with a counterparty that permits net settlement of multiple transactions with that counterparty, including upon the exercise of termination rights by a non-defaulting

party. Upon exercise of such termination rights, all transactions governed by the netting agreement are terminated and a net settlement amount is calculated. In addition, the firm receives and posts cash and securities collateral with respect to its derivatives and securities financing transactions, subject to the terms of the related credit support agreements or similar arrangements (collectively, credit support agreements). An enforceable credit support agreement grants the non-defaulting

party exercising termination rights the right to liquidate the collateral and apply the proceeds to any amounts owed. In order to assess enforceability of the firm&#8217;s right of setoff under netting and credit support agreements, the firm evaluates various factors, including applicable bankruptcy laws, local statutes and regulatory provisions in the jurisdiction of the parties to the agreement.

&#160;

##TABLE_END 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

&#160;

Derivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty

basis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) in the consolidated balance sheets when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement. Resale agreements and securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) and securities borrowed and loaned transactions with the same term and currency are presented on a net-by-counterparty

basis in the consolidated balance sheets when such transactions meet certain settlement criteria and are subject to netting agreements. 

In the consolidated balance sheets, derivatives are reported net of cash collateral received and posted under enforceable credit support agreements, when transacted under an enforceable netting agreement. In the consolidated balance sheets, resale and repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed and loaned, are not reported net of the related cash and securities received or posted as collateral. See Note 11 for further information about collateral received and pledged, including rights to deliver or repledge collateral. See Notes 7 and 11 for further information about offsetting assets and liabilities. 

Foreign Currency Translation 

Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S.

currencies are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the consolidated balance sheets and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange for the period. Foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses on transactions in nonfunctional currencies are recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on translation of the financial statements of a non-U.S.

operation, when the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are included, net of hedges and taxes, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 

Recent Accounting Developments 

Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASC 326).

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,

&#8220;Financial Instruments &#8212; Credit Losses (Topic 326) &#8212; Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.&#8221; This ASU amends several aspects of the measurement of credit losses on certain financial instruments, including replacing the existing incurred credit loss model and other models with the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) model and amending certain aspects of accounting for purchased financial assets with deterioration in credit quality since origination. 

The firm adopted this ASU in January 2020 under a modified retrospective approach. As a result of adopting this ASU, the firm&#8217;s allowance for credit losses on financial assets and commitments that are measured at amortized cost reflects management&#8217;s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life of such assets. Expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets and commitments, as well as changes to expected credit losses during the period, are recognized in earnings. These expected credit losses are measured based on historical experience, current conditions and forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. 

The cumulative effect of measuring the allowance under CECL as a result of adopting this ASU as of January 1, 2020 was an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $ 848 million. The increase in the allowance is driven by the fact that the allowance under CECL covers expected credit losses over the full expected life of the loan portfolios and also takes into account forecasts of expected future economic conditions. In addition, in accordance with the ASU, the firm elected the fair value option for loans that were previously accounted for as Purchased Credit Impaired (PCI), which resulted in a decrease to the allowance for PCI loans of $ 169 million. The cumulative effect of adopting this ASU was a decrease to retained earnings of $ 638 million (net of tax). 

Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (ASC 848).

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04,

&#8220;Reference Rate Reform &#8212; Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.&#8221; This ASU provides optional relief from applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. In addition, in January 2021 the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01,

&#8220;Reference Rate Reform &#8212; Scope,&#8221; which clarified the scope of ASC 848 relating to contract modifications. The firm adopted these ASUs upon issuance and elected to apply the relief available to certain modified derivatives. The adoption of these ASUs did not have a material impact on the firm&#8217;s consolidated financial statements.

Note 4. 

Fair Value Measurements 

&#160;

The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. The firm measures certain financial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks). 

The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an active market. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is determined by reference to prices for similar instruments, quoted prices or recent transactions in less active markets, or internally developed models that primarily use market-based or independently sourced inputs, including, but not limited to, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, credit spreads and funding spreads (i.e., the spread or difference between the interest rate at which a borrower could finance a given financial instrument relative to a benchmark interest rate). 

U.S. GAAP has a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. This hierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value, giving the highest priority to level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial instrument&#8217;s level in this hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to its fair value measurement. In evaluating the significance of a valuation input, the firm considers, among other factors, a portfolio&#8217;s net risk exposure to that input. The fair value hierarchy is as follows: 

Level 1.

Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets to which the firm had access at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. 

Level 2.

Inputs to valuation techniques are observable, either directly or indirectly. 

Level 3.

One or more inputs to valuation techniques are significant and unobservable. 

The fair values for substantially all of the firm&#8217;s financial assets and liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets and liabilities may require valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors, such as counterparty and the firm&#8217;s credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads. Valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence. 

The valuation techniques and nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the firm&#8217;s financial instruments are described below. See Notes 5 through 10 for further information about significant unobservable inputs used to value level 3 financial instruments. 

Valuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Trading Cash Instruments, Investments and Loans 

Level 1.

Level 1 instruments include U.S. government obligations, most non-U.S.

government obligations, certain agency obligations, certain corporate debt instruments, certain money market instruments and actively traded listed equities. These instruments are valued using quoted prices for identical unrestricted instruments in active markets. The firm defines active markets for equity instruments based on the average daily trading volume both in absolute terms and relative to the market capitalization for the instrument. The firm defines active markets for debt instruments based on both the average daily trading volume and the number of days with trading activity. 

Level 2.

Level 2 instruments include certain non-U.S.

government obligations, most agency obligations, most mortgage-backed loans and securities, most corporate debt instruments, most state and municipal obligations, most money market instruments, most other debt obligations, restricted or less liquid listed equities, certain private equities, commodities and certain lending commitments. 

Valuations of level 2 instruments can be verified to quoted prices, recent trading activity for identical or similar instruments, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or executable) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

&#160;

Valuation adjustments are typically made to level 2 instruments (i) if the instrument is subject to transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other premiums and liquidity discounts that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value. Valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence. 

Level 3.

Level 3 instruments have one or more significant valuation inputs that are not observable. Absent evidence to the contrary, level 3 instruments are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequently, the firm uses other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Valuation inputs and assumptions are changed when corroborated by substantive observable evidence, including values realized on sales. 

Valuation techniques of level 3 instruments vary by instrument, but are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques. The valuation techniques and the nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair values of each type of level 3 instrument are described below: 

Loans and Securities Backed by Commercial Real Estate 

Loans and securities backed by commercial real estate are directly or indirectly collateralized by a single property or a portfolio of properties and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. Significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses and include: 

&#160;

##TABLE_END Valuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Derivatives 

The firm&#8217;s level 2 and level 3 derivatives are valued using derivative pricing models (e.g., discounted cash flow models, correlation models and models that incorporate option pricing methodologies, such as Monte Carlo simulations). Price transparency of derivatives can generally be characterized by product type, as described below. 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Interest Rate.

In general, the key inputs used to value interest rate derivatives are transparent, even for most long-dated contracts. Interest rate swaps and options denominated in the currencies of leading industrialized nations are characterized by high trading volumes and tight bid/offer spreads. Interest rate derivatives that reference indices, such as an inflation index, or the shape of the yield curve (e.g., 10-year

swap rate vs. 2-year

swap rate) are more complex, but the key inputs are generally observable. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Credit.

Price transparency for credit default swaps, including both single names and baskets of credits, varies by market and underlying reference entity or obligation. Credit default swaps that reference indices, large corporates and major sovereigns generally exhibit the most price transparency. For credit default swaps with other underliers, price transparency varies based on credit rating, the cost of borrowing the underlying reference obligations, and the availability of the underlying reference obligations for delivery upon the default of the issuer. Credit default swaps that reference loans, asset-backed securities and emerging market debt instruments tend to have less price transparency than those that reference corporate bonds. In addition, more complex credit derivatives, such as those sensitive to the correlation between two or more underlying reference obligations, generally have less price transparency. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Currency.

Prices for currency derivatives based on the exchange rates of leading industrialized nations, including those with longer tenors, are generally transparent. The primary difference between the price transparency of developed and emerging market currency derivatives is that emerging markets tend to be only observable for contracts with shorter tenors. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Commodity.

Commodity derivatives include transactions referenced to energy (e.g., oil, natural gas and electricity), metals (e.g., precious and base) and soft commodities (e.g., agricultural). Price transparency varies based on the underlying commodity, delivery location, tenor and product quality (e.g., diesel fuel compared to unleaded gasoline). In general, price transparency for commodity derivatives is greater for contracts with shorter tenors and contracts that are more closely aligned with major and/or benchmark commodity indices. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Equity.

Price transparency for equity derivatives varies by market and underlier. Options on indices and the common stock of corporates included in major equity indices exhibit the most price transparency. Equity derivatives generally have observable market prices, except for contracts with long tenors or reference prices that differ significantly from current market prices. More complex equity derivatives, such as those sensitive to the correlation between two or more individual stocks, generally have less price transparency. 

##TABLE_END Liquidity is essential to observability of all product types. If transaction volumes decline, previously transparent prices and other inputs may become unobservable. Conversely, even highly structured products may at times have trading volumes large enough to provide observability of prices and other inputs.

Level 1.

Level 1 derivatives include short-term contracts for future delivery of securities when the underlying security is a level 1 instrument, and exchange-traded derivatives if they are actively traded and are valued at their quoted market price. 

Level 2.

Level 2 derivatives include OTC derivatives for which all significant valuation inputs are corroborated by market evidence and exchange-traded derivatives that are not actively traded and/or that are valued using models that calibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC derivatives. 

The selection of a particular model to value a derivative depends on the contractual terms of and specific risks inherent in the instrument, as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. For derivatives that trade in liquid markets, model selection does not involve significant management judgment because outputs of models can be calibrated to market-clearing levels. 

Valuation models require a variety of inputs, such as contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, discount rates (including those derived from interest rates on collateral received and posted as specified in credit support agreements for collateralized derivatives), credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates, loss severity rates and correlations of such inputs. Significant inputs to the valuations of level 2 derivatives can be verified to market transactions, broker or dealer quotations or other alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or executable) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources. 

Level 3.

Level 3 derivatives are valued using models which utilize observable level 1 and/or level 2 inputs, as well as unobservable level 3 inputs. The significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm&#8217;s level 3 derivatives are described below. 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; For level 3 interest rate and currency derivatives, significant unobservable inputs include correlations of certain currencies and interest rates (e.g., the correlation between Euro inflation and Euro interest rates) and specific interest rate and currency volatilities. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; For level 3 credit derivatives, significant unobservable inputs include illiquid credit spreads and upfront credit points, which are unique to specific reference obligations and reference entities, and recovery rates. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; For level 3 commodity derivatives, significant unobservable inputs include volatilities for options with strike prices that differ significantly from current market prices and prices or spreads for certain products for which the product quality or physical location of the commodity is not aligned with benchmark indices. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; For level 3 equity derivatives, significant unobservable inputs generally include equity volatility inputs for options that are long-dated and/or have strike prices that differ significantly from current market prices. In addition, the valuation of certain structured trades requires the use of level 3 correlation inputs, such as the correlation of the price performance of two or more individual stocks or the correlation of the price performance for a basket of stocks to another asset class, such as commodities. 

##TABLE_END Subsequent to the initial valuation of a level 3 derivative, the firm updates the level 1 and level 2 inputs to reflect observable market changes and any resulting gains and losses are classified in level 3. Level 3 inputs are changed when corroborated by evidence, such as similar market transactions, third-party pricing services and/or broker or dealer quotations or other empirical market data. In circumstances where the firm cannot verify the model value by reference to market transactions, it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate of fair value. See Note 7 for further information about significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of level 3 derivatives. 

Valuation Adjustments.

Valuation adjustments are integral to determining the fair value of derivative portfolios and are used to adjust the mid-market

valuations produced by derivative pricing models to the exit price valuation. These adjustments incorporate bid/offer spreads, the cost of liquidity, and credit and funding valuation adjustments, which account for the credit and funding risk inherent in the uncollateralized portion of derivative portfolios. The firm also makes funding valuation adjustments to collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit the firm to deliver or repledge collateral received. Market-based inputs are generally used when calibrating valuation adjustments to market-clearing levels. 

In addition, for derivatives that include significant unobservable inputs, the firm makes model or exit price adjustments to account for the valuation uncertainty present in the transaction.

Valuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Other Financial Instruments at Fair Value 

In addition to trading cash instruments, derivatives, and certain investments and loans, the firm accounts for certain of its other financial assets and liabilities at fair value under the fair value option. Such instruments include resale and repurchase agreements; certain securities borrowed and loaned transactions; certain customer and other receivables, including certain margin loans; certain time deposits, including structured certificates of deposit, which are hybrid financial instruments; substantially all other secured financings, including transfers of assets accounted for as financings; certain unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, substantially all of which are hybrid financial instruments; and certain other liabilities. These instruments are generally valued based on discounted cash flow techniques, which incorporate inputs with reasonable levels of price transparency, and are generally classified in level 2 because the inputs are observable. Valuation adjustments may be made for liquidity and for counterparty and the firm&#8217;s credit quality. The significant inputs used to value the firm&#8217;s other financial instruments are described below. 

Resale and Repurchase Agreements and Securities Borrowed and Loaned.

The significant inputs to the valuation of resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and loaned are funding spreads, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and interest rates. 

Customer and Other Receivables.

The significant inputs to the valuation of receivables are interest rates, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and funding spreads. 

Deposits.

The significant inputs to the valuation of time deposits are interest rates and the amount and timing of future cash flows. The inputs used to value the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial instruments are consistent with the inputs used to value the firm&#8217;s other derivative instruments described above. See Note 7 for further information about derivatives and Note 13 for further information about deposits. 

Other Secured Financings.

The significant inputs to the valuation of other secured financings are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, interest rates, funding spreads and the fair value of the collateral delivered by the firm (determined using the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, market prices, market yields and recovery assumptions). See Note 11 for further information about other secured financings. 

Unsecured Short- and Long-Term Borrowings.

The significant inputs to the valuation of unsecured short- and long-term borrowings are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, interest rates, the credit spreads of the firm and commodity prices for prepaid commodity transactions. The inputs used to value the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial instruments are consistent with the inputs used to value the firm&#8217;s other derivative instruments described above. See Note 7 for further information about derivatives and Note 14 for further information about borrowings. 

Other Liabilities.

The significant inputs to the valuation of other liabilities are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and equity volatility and correlation inputs. The inputs used to value the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial instruments are consistent with the inputs used to value the firm&#8217;s other derivative instruments described above. See Note 7 for further information about derivatives.

For example, most of the firm&#8217;s longer-term derivatives across product types are sensitive to changes in interest rates and may be economically hedged with interest rate swaps. Similarly, a significant portion of the firm&#8217;s trading cash instruments and derivatives across product types has exposure to foreign currencies and may be economically hedged with foreign currency contracts.

As of both December 2021 and December 2020, level 3 government and agency obligations, state and municipal obligations, other debt obligations and commodities were not material, and, therefore, are not included in the table above. In addition, as of both December 2021 and December 2020, each of the significant unobservable inputs for equity securities did not have a range as they pertained to individual positions. Therefore, such unobservable inputs are not included in the table above.

In the table above: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of trading cash instrument. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Weighted averages are calculated by weighting each input by the relative fair value of the trading cash instruments. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; The ranges and weighted averages of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one trading cash instrument. For example, the highest recovery rate for corporate debt instruments is appropriate for valuing a specific corporate debt instrument, but may not be appropriate for valuing any other corporate debt instrument. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 trading cash instruments. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Increases in yield, duration or cumulative loss rate used in the valuation of level 3 trading cash instruments would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement, while increases in recovery rate would have resulted in a higher fair value measurement as of both December 2021 and December 2020. Due to the distinctive nature of each level 3 trading cash instrument, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type.

As a result, gains or losses included in the level 3 rollforward below do not necessarily represent the overall impact on the firm&#8217;s results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.

Level 3 Rollforward Commentary 

Year Ended December 2021.

The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 trading cash instrument assets of $ 132 million (reflecting $ 80 million of net realized gains and $ 52 million of net unrealized gains) for 2021 included gains of $ 45 million reported in market making and $ 87 million reported in interest income. 

The drivers of the net unrealized gains on level 3 trading cash instrument assets for 2021 were not material. 

Transfers into level 3 trading cash instrument assets during 2021 primarily reflected transfers of certain corporate debt instruments from level 2 (principally due to certain unobservable yield and duration inputs becoming significant to the valuation of these instruments, and reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence, including fewer market transactions in these instruments). 

Transfers out of level 3 trading cash instrument assets during 2021 primarily reflected transfers of certain corporate debt instruments, and loans and securities backed by commercial real estate to level 2 (in each case, principally due to increased price transparency as a result of market evidence, including market transactions in these instruments, and certain unobservable yield and duration inputs no longer being significant to the valuation of these instruments). 

Year Ended December 2020.

The net realized and unrealized losses on level 3 trading cash instrument assets of $ 77 million (reflecting $ 66 million of net realized gains and $ 143 million of net unrealized losses) for 2020 included gains/(losses) of $( 193 ) million reported in market making and $ 116 million reported in interest income. 

The net unrealized losses on level 3 trading cash instrument assets for 2020 primarily reflected losses on certain corporate debt instruments (principally driven by wider credit spreads). 

Transfers into level 3 trading cash instrument assets during 2020 primarily reflected transfers of certain corporate debt instruments from level 2 (principally due to reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence, including fewer market transactions in these instruments). 

Transfers out of level 3 trading cash instrument assets during 2020 primarily reflected transfers of certain corporate debt instruments, and loans and securities backed by residential real estate to level 2 (in each case, principally due to increased price transparency as a result of market evidence, including market transactions in these instruments).

Derivatives and Hedging Activities 

Derivative Activities 

Derivatives are instruments that derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates and other inputs, or a combination of these factors. Derivatives may be traded on an exchange (exchange-traded) or they may be privately negotiated contracts, which are usually referred to as OTC derivatives. Certain of the firm&#8217;s OTC derivatives are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties (OTC-cleared),

while others are bilateral contracts between two counterparties (bilateral OTC).

&#160;

Market Making.

As a market maker, the firm enters into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. In this role, the firm typically acts as principal and is required to commit capital to provide execution, and maintains market-making positions in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand. 

Risk Management.

The firm also enters into derivatives to actively manage risk exposures that arise from its market-making and investing and financing activities. The firm&#8217;s holdings and exposures are hedged, in many cases, on either a portfolio or risk-specific basis, as opposed to an instrument-by-instrument basis. The offsetting impact of this economic hedging is reflected in the same business segment as the related revenues. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives designated as hedges under U.S. GAAP. These derivatives are used to manage interest rate exposure of certain fixed-rate unsecured borrowings and deposits, foreign exchange risk of certain available-for-sale securities and the net investment in certain non-U.S.

operations, and the price risk of certain commodities. 

The firm enters into various types of derivatives, including: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Futures and Forwards.

Contracts that commit counterparties to purchase or sell financial instruments, commodities or currencies in the future. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Swaps.

Contracts that require counterparties to exchange cash flows, such as currency or interest payment streams. The amounts exchanged are based on the specific terms of the contract with reference to specified rates, financial instruments, commodities, currencies or indices. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Options.

Contracts in which the option purchaser has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from or sell to the option writer financial instruments, commodities or currencies within a defined time period for a specified price. 

##TABLE_END Derivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty

basis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement (counterparty netting). Derivatives are accounted for at fair value, net of cash collateral received or posted under enforceable credit support agreements (cash collateral netting). Derivative assets are included in trading assets and derivative liabilities are included in trading liabilities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges are included in market making (for derivatives included in the Global Markets segment), and other principal transactions (for derivatives included in the remaining business segments) in the consolidated statements of earnings. For both 2021 and 2020, substantially all of the firm&#8217;s derivatives were included in the Global Markets segment. 

The tables below present the gross fair value and the notional amounts of derivative contracts by major product type, the amounts of counterparty and cash collateral netting in the consolidated balance sheets, as well as cash and securities collateral posted and received under enforceable credit support agreements 

that do not meet 

the criteria for netting under U.S. GAAP.

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of derivative. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Averages represent the arithmetic average of the inputs and are not weighted by the relative fair value or notional amount of the respective financial instruments. An average greater than the median indicates that the majority of inputs are below the average. For example, the difference between the average and the median for credit spreads indicates that the majority of the inputs fall in the lower end of the range. 

##TABLE_END 

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; The ranges, averages and medians of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one derivative. For example, the highest correlation for interest rate derivatives is appropriate for valuing a specific interest rate derivative but may not be appropriate for valuing any other interest rate derivative. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 derivatives. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Interest rates, currencies and equities derivatives are valued using option pricing models, credit derivatives are valued using option pricing, correlation and discounted cash flow models, and commodities derivatives are valued using option pricing and discounted cash flow models. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; The fair value of any one instrument may be determined using multiple valuation techniques. For example, option pricing models and discounted cash flow models are typically used together to determine fair value. Therefore, the level 3 balance encompasses both of these techniques. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Correlation within currencies and equities includes cross-product type correlation. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Natural gas spread represents the spread per million British thermal units of natural gas.

##TABLE_END Range of Significant Unobservable Inputs 

The following provides information about the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm&#8217;s level 3 derivative instruments: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Correlation.

Ranges for correlation cover a variety of underliers both within one product type (e.g., equity index and equity single stock names) and across product types (e.g., correlation of an interest rate and a currency), as well as across regions. Generally, cross-product type correlation inputs are used to value more complex instruments and are lower than correlation inputs on assets within the same derivative product type.

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Volatility.

Ranges for volatility cover numerous underliers across a variety of markets, maturities and strike prices. For example, volatility of equity indices is generally lower than volatility of single stocks.

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates.

The ranges for credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates cover a variety of underliers (index and single names), regions, sectors, maturities and credit qualities (high-yield and investment-grade). The broad range of this population gives rise to the width of the ranges of significant unobservable inputs. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Commodity prices and spreads.

The ranges for commodity prices and spreads cover variability in products, maturities and delivery locations. 

##TABLE_END Sensitivity of Fair Value Measurement to Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs 

The following is a description of the directional sensitivity of the firm&#8217;s level 3 fair value measurements to changes in significant unobservable inputs, in isolation, as of each period-end:

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Correlation.

In general, for contracts where the holder benefits from the convergence of the underlying asset or index prices (e.g., interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, inflation rates and equity prices), an increase in correlation results in a higher fair value measurement. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Volatility.

In general, for purchased options, an increase in volatility results in a higher fair value measurement. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates.

In general, the fair value of purchased credit protection increases as credit spreads or upfront credit points increase or recovery rates decrease. Credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates are strongly related to distinctive risk factors of the underlying reference obligations, which include reference entity-specific factors, such as leverage, volatility and industry, market-based risk factors, such as borrowing costs or liquidity of the underlying reference obligation, and macroeconomic conditions. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Commodity prices and spreads.

In general, for contracts where the holder is receiving a commodity, an increase in the spread (price difference from a benchmark index due to differences in quality or delivery location) or price results in a higher fair value measurement. 

##TABLE_END Due to the distinctive nature of each of the firm&#8217;s level 3 derivatives, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type.

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; A derivative with level 1 and/or level 2 inputs is classified in level 3 in its entirety if it has at least one significant level 3 input. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; If there is one significant level 3 input, the entire gain or loss from adjusting only observable inputs (i.e., level 1 and level 2 inputs) is classified in level 3. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

Year Ended December 2021.

The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 derivatives of $ 717 million (reflecting $ 265 million of net realized gains and $ 452 million of net unrealized gains) for 2021 included gains of $ 700 million reported in market making and gains of $ 17 million reported in other principal transactions. 

The net unrealized gains on level 3 derivatives for 2021 were primarily attributable to gains on certain credit and currency derivatives (in each case, primarily reflecting the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates), gains on certain commodity derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in commodity prices) and gains on certain interest rate derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in interest rates), partially offset by losses on certain equity derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in equity prices). 

The drivers of transfers into level 3 derivatives during 2021 were not material. 

Transfers out of level 3 derivatives during 2021 primarily reflected transfers of certain interest rate derivative assets to level 2 (principally due to increased transparency of certain volatility inputs used to value these derivatives). 

Year Ended December 2020.

The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 derivatives of $ 838 million (reflecting $ 226 million of net realized gains and $ 612 million of net unrealized gains) for 2020 included gains of $ 900 million reported in market making and losses of $ 62 million reported in other principal transactions. 

The net unrealized gains on level 3 derivatives for 2020 were primarily attributable to gains on certain equity derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of an increase in equity prices), gains on certain interest rate derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of a decrease in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates), gains on certain commodity derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of changes in commodity prices), and gains on certain credit derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of a decrease in interest rates), partially offset by losses on certain currency derivatives (primarily reflecting the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and a decrease in interest rates). 

The drivers of both transfers into level 3 derivatives and transfers out of level 3 derivatives during 2020 were not material.

##TABLE_END Credit Derivatives 

The firm enters into a broad array of credit derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage the credit risk associated with market-making and investing and financing activities. Credit derivatives are actively managed based on the firm&#8217;s net risk position. Credit derivatives are generally individually negotiated contracts and can have various settlement and payment conventions. Credit events include failure to pay, bankruptcy, acceleration of indebtedness, restructuring, repudiation and dissolution of the reference entity. 

The firm enters into the following types of credit derivatives: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Credit Default Swaps.

Single-name credit default swaps protect the buyer against the loss of principal on one or more bonds, loans or mortgages (reference obligations) in the event the issuer of the reference obligations suffers a credit event. The buyer of protection pays an initial or periodic premium to the seller and receives protection for the period of the contract. If there is no credit event, as defined in the contract, the seller of protection makes no payments to the buyer. If a credit event occurs, the seller of protection is required to make a payment to the buyer, calculated according to the terms of the contract. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Credit Options.

In a credit option, the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell a reference obligation at a specified price or credit spread. The option purchaser buys the right, but does not assume the obligation, to sell the reference obligation to, or purchase it from, the option writer. The payments on credit options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the reference obligation.

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Credit Indices, Baskets and Tranches.

Credit derivatives may reference a basket of single-name credit default swaps or a broad-based index. If a credit event occurs in one of the underlying reference obligations, the protection seller pays the protection buyer. The payment is typically a pro-rata

portion of the transaction&#8217;s total notional amount based on the underlying defaulted reference obligation. In certain transactions, the credit risk of a basket or index is separated into various portions (tranches), each having different levels of subordination. The most junior tranches cover initial defaults and once losses exceed the notional amount of these junior tranches, any excess loss is covered by the next most senior tranche. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Total Return Swaps.

A total return swap transfers the risks relating to economic performance of a reference obligation from the protection buyer to the protection seller. Typically, the protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and protection against any reduction in fair value of the reference obligation, and the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference obligation, plus any increase in the fair value of the reference obligation. 

##TABLE_END The firm economically hedges its exposure to written credit derivatives primarily by entering into offsetting purchased credit derivatives with identical underliers. Substantially all of the firm&#8217;s purchased credit derivative transactions are with financial institutions and are subject to stringent collateral thresholds. In addition, upon the occurrence of a specified trigger event, the firm may take possession of the reference obligations underlying a particular written credit derivative, and consequently may, upon liquidation of the reference obligations, recover amounts on the underlying reference obligations in the event of default. 

As of December 2021, written credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $ 510.24 billion and purchased credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $ 569.34 billion, for total net notional purchased protection of $ 59.10 billion. As of December 2020, written credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $ 515.85 billion and purchased credit derivatives had a total gross notional amount of $ 558.18 billion, for total net notional purchased protection of $ 42.33 billion. The firm&#8217;s written and purchased credit derivatives primarily consist of credit default swaps.

Impact of Credit and Funding Spreads on Derivatives 

The firm realizes gains or losses on its derivative contracts. These gains or losses include credit valuation adjustments (CVA) relating to uncollateralized derivative assets and liabilities, which represent the gains or losses (including hedges) attributable to the impact of changes in credit exposure, counterparty credit spreads, liability funding spreads (which include the firm&#8217;s own credit), probability of default and assumed recovery. These gains or losses also include funding valuation adjustments (FVA) relating to uncollateralized derivative assets, which represent the gains or losses (including hedges) attributable to the impact of changes in expected funding exposures and funding spreads. 

The table below presents information about CVA and FVA.

Derivatives with Credit-Related Contingent Features 

Certain of the firm&#8217;s derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require the firm to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in the firm&#8217;s credit ratings. The firm assesses the impact of these bilateral agreements by determining the collateral or termination payments that would occur assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies. A downgrade by any one rating agency, depending on the agency&#8217;s relative ratings of the firm at the time of the downgrade, may have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all rating agencies. 

The table below presents information about net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements (excluding collateral posted), the fair value of collateral posted and additional collateral or termination payments that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a one-

or two-notch

downgrade in the firm&#8217;s credit ratings.

The firm applies hedge accounting for (i) interest rate swaps used to manage the interest rate exposure of certain fixed-rate unsecured long- and short-term borrowings and certain fixed-rate certificates of deposit, (ii) foreign exchange forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange risk of certain available-for-sale

securities, (iii) foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency-denominated debt used to manage foreign currency exposures on the firm&#8217;s net investment in certain non-U.S.

operations and (iv) commodity futures contracts used to manage the price risk of certain commodities. 

To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging instrument must be highly effective at reducing the risk from the exposure being hedged. Additionally, the firm must formally document the hedging relationship at inception and assess the hedging relationship at least on a quarterly basis to ensure the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective over the life of the hedging relationship.

Fair Value Hedges 

The firm designates interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of certain fixed-rate unsecured long- and short-term debt and fixed-rate certificates of deposit. These interest rate swaps hedge changes in fair value attributable to the designated benchmark interest rate (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or Overnight Index Swap Rate), effectively converting a substantial portion of fixed-rate obligations into floating-rate obligations. 

The firm applies a statistical method that utilizes regression analysis when assessing the effectiveness of these hedging relationships in achieving offsetting changes in the fair values of the hedging instrument and the risk being hedged (i.e., interest rate risk). An interest rate swap is considered highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value attributable to changes in the hedged risk when the regression analysis results in a coefficient of determination of 80% or greater and a slope between 80% and 125%. 

For qualifying interest rate fair value hedges, gains or losses on derivatives are included in interest expense. The change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged is reported as an adjustment to its carrying value (hedging adjustment) and is also included in interest expense. When a derivative is no longer designated as a hedge, any remaining difference between the carrying value and par value of the hedged item is amortized in interest expense over the remaining life of the hedged item using the effective interest method. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense. 

The table below presents the gains/(losses) from interest rate derivatives accounted for as hedges and the related hedged borrowings and deposits, and total interest expense.

In addition, 

cumulative hedging adjustments for items no longer designated in a hedging relationship were $ 68 million as of December 2021 and $ 489 million as of December 2020 and substantially all were related to unsecured long-term borrowings. 

The firm designates foreign exchange forward contracts as fair value hedges of the foreign exchange risk of non-U.S.

government securities classified as available-for-sale.

See Note 8 for information about the amortized cost and fair value of such securities. The effectiveness of such hedges is assessed based on changes in spot rates. The gains/(losses) on the hedges (relating to both spot and forward points) and the foreign exchange gains/(losses) on the related available-for-sale

securities were included in market making and were not material for both 2021 and 2020. 

During 2021, the firm designated commodity futures contracts as fair value hedges of the price risk of certain precious metals included in commodities within trading assets. As of December 2021, the carrying value of such commodities was $ 1.05 billion and the amortized cost was $ 1.02 billion. Changes in spot rates of such commodities are reflected as an adjustment to their carrying value, and the related gains/(losses) on both the commodities and the designated futures contracts are included in market making. The contractual forward points on the designated futures contracts are amortized into earnings ratably over the life of the contract and other gains/(losses) as a result of changes in the forward points are included in other comprehensive income/(loss). The cumulative hedging adjustment was not material as of December 2021 and the related gains/(losses) were not material for 2021.

Net Investment Hedges 

The firm seeks to reduce the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on its net investments in certain non-U.S.

operations through the use of foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency-denominated debt. For foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges, the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed based on the overall changes in the fair value of the forward contracts (i.e., based on changes in forward rates). For foreign currency-denominated debt designated as a hedge, the effectiveness of the hedge is assessed based on changes in spot rates. For qualifying net investment hedges, all gains or losses on the hedging instruments are included in currency translation. 

The table below presents the gains/(losses) from net investment hedging.

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Other included $ 1.67 billion as of December 2021 and $ 1.31 billion as of December 2020 of investments in credit funds that are measured at NAV. 

##TABLE_END Investments in Funds at Net Asset Value Per Share.

Equity securities and debt instruments, at fair value include investments in funds that are measured at NAV of the investment fund. The firm uses NAV to measure the fair value of fund investments when (i) the fund investment does not have a readily determinable fair value and (ii) the NAV of the investment fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of investment company accounting, including measurement of the investments at fair value. 

Substantially all of the firm&#8217;s investments in funds at NAV consist of investments in firm-sponsored private equity, credit, real estate and hedge funds where the firm co-invests

with third-party investors. 

Private equity funds primarily invest in a broad range of industries worldwide, including leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations, growth investments and distressed investments. Credit funds generally invest in loans and other fixed income instruments and are focused on providing private high-yield capital for leveraged and management buyout transactions, recapitalizations, financings, refinancings, acquisitions and restructurings for private equity firms, private family companies and corporate issuers. Real estate funds invest globally, primarily in real estate companies, loan portfolios, debt recapitalizations and property. Private equity, credit and real estate funds are closed-end

funds in which the firm&#8217;s investments are generally not eligible for redemption. Distributions will be received from these funds as the underlying assets are liquidated or distributed, the timing of which is uncertain. 

The firm also invests in hedge funds, primarily multi-disciplinary hedge funds that employ a fundamental bottom-up

investment approach across various asset classes and strategies. The firm&#8217;s investments in hedge funds primarily include interests where the underlying assets are illiquid in nature, and proceeds from redemptions will not be received until the underlying assets are liquidated or distributed, the timing of which is uncertain. 

Private equity and hedge funds described above are primarily &#8220;covered funds&#8221; as defined in the Volcker Rule of the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). Substantially all of the credit and real estate funds described above are not covered funds. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) extended the conformance period to July 2022 for the firm&#8217;s investments in, and relationships with, certain legacy &#8220;illiquid funds&#8221; (as defined in the Volcker Rule) that were in place prior to December 2013. This extension is applicable to substantially all of the firm&#8217;s remaining investments in, and relationships with, such covered funds. As of December 2021, the firm&#8217;s total investments in funds at NAV of $ 3.47 billion included $ 903 &#160; million of investments in covered funds for which compliance with the Volcker Rule will need to be achieved by July 2022. 

The firm expects to achieve compliance for these covered funds through ongoing harvesting of underlying fund investments in the ordinary course or through structural modifications to these funds. To the extent that the firm is not able to achieve compliance through these measures, the firm will be required to sell its interests in such funds by July 2022. If that occurs, the firm may receive a value for its interests that is less than the then carrying value as there could be a limited secondary market for these investments and the firm may be unable to sell them in orderly transactions.

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; If the fair value of available-for-sale securities is less than amortized cost, such securities are considered impaired. If the firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the firm will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost, the difference between the amortized cost (net of allowance, if any) and the fair value of the securities is recognized as an impairment loss in earnings. The firm did not record any such impairment losses during either 2021 or 2020. Impaired available-for-sale debt securities that the firm has the intent and ability to hold are reviewed to determine if an allowance for credit losses should be recorded. The firm considers various factors in such determination, including market conditions, changes in issuer credit ratings and severity of the unrealized losses. The firm did not record any provision for credit losses on such securities during either 2021 or 2020.

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of investment. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Weighted averages are calculated by weighting each input by the relative fair value of the investment. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; The ranges and weighted averages of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one investment. For example, the highest multiple for private equity securities is appropriate for valuing a specific private equity security but may not be appropriate for valuing any other private equity security. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 investments. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Increases in yield, discount rate, capitalization rate or duration used in the valuation of level 3 investments would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement, while increases in recovery rate or multiples would have resulted in a higher fair value measurement as of both December 2021 and December 2020. Due to the distinctive nature of each level 3 investment, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type.

Year Ended December 2021.

The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 investments of $ 1.71 billion (reflecting $ 449 million of net realized gains and $ 1.26 billion of net unrealized gains) for 2021 included gains of $ 1.53 billion reported in other principal transactions and $ 180 million reported in interest income. 

The net unrealized gains on level 3 investments for 2021 primarily reflected gains on certain private equity securities and corporate debt securities (in each case, principally driven by corporate performance and company-specific events).

&#160;

Transfers into level 3 investments during 2021 primarily reflected transfers of certain corporate debt securities from level 2 (principally due to reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence, including fewer market transactions in these instruments, and certain unobservable yield and duration inputs becoming significant to the valuation of these instruments) and transfers of certain private equity securities from level 2 (principally due to reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence, including fewer market transactions in these instruments). 

Transfers out of level 3 investments during 2021 primarily reflected transfers of certain private equity securities to level 2 (principally due to increased price transparency as a result of market evidence, including market transactions in these instruments) and transfers of certain corporate debt securities to level 2 (principally due to certain unobservable yield and duration inputs no longer being significant to the valuation of these instruments, and increased price transparency as a result of market evidence, including market transactions of these instruments). 

Year Ended December 2020.

The net realized and unrealized losses on level 3 investments of $ 228 million (reflecting $ 215 million of net realized gains and $ 443 million of net unrealized losses) for 2020 included losses of $ 428 million reported in other principal transactions and $ 200 million reported in interest income. 

The net unrealized losses on level 3 investments for 2020 reflected losses on certain private equity, corporate debt securities and securities backed by real estate (in each case, principally driven by corporate performance).

##TABLE_END Credit Quality 

Risk Assessment.

The firm&#8217;s risk assessment process includes evaluating the credit quality of its loans by our independent risk oversight and control function. For corporate loans and a majority of wealth management, real estate and other loans, the firm performs credit reviews which include initial and ongoing analyses of its borrowers, resulting in an internal credit rating. A credit review is an analysis of the capacity and willingness of a borrower to meet its financial obligations and is performed on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances change that indicate that a review may be necessary. The determination of internal credit ratings also incorporates assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the borrower&#8217;s industry and the economic environment.

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; The top five industry concentrations for corporate loans as of December 2021 were 21 % for funds ( 13 % as of December 2020), 18 % for technology, media &#38; telecommunications ( 17 % as of December 2020), 13 % for diversified industrials ( 17 % as of December 2020), 9 % for natural resources &#38; utilities ( 12 % as of December 2020), and 8 % for financial institutions ( 10 % as of December 2020). 

##TABLE_END Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans.

Loans accounted for at amortized cost (other than credit card loans) are placed on nonaccrual status when it is probable that the firm will not collect all principal and interest due under the contractual terms, regardless of the delinquency status or if a loan is past due for 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well collateralized and in the process of collection. At that time, all accrued but uncollected interest is reversed against interest income and interest subsequently collected is recognized on a cash basis to the extent the loan balance is deemed collectible. Otherwise, all cash received is used to reduce the outstanding loan balance. A loan is considered past due when a principal or interest payment has not been made according to its contractual terms. Credit card loans are not placed on nonaccrual status and accrue interest until the loan is paid in full or is charged off. 

In certain circumstances, the firm may modify the original terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, typically in the form of a modification of loan covenants, but may also include forbearance of interest or principal, payment extensions or interest rate reductions. These modifications, to the extent significant, are considered troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). Loan modifications that extend payment terms for a period of less than 90 days are generally considered insignificant and therefore not reported as TDRs. 

The firm adopted the relief issued under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), as amended, and certain interpretive guidance issued by the U.S. banking agencies that provides for certain modified loans that would otherwise meet the definition of a TDR to not be classified as such. Loans accounted for at amortized cost that were not classified as TDRs as a result of this relief and interpretive guidance were $ 166 million as of December 2021 and were $ 184 million as of December 2020. The relief provided under the CARES Act expired in January 2022.

##TABLE_END 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

The firm&#8217;s allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for losses on loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost. Loans and lending commitments accounted for at fair value or accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value are not subject to an allowance for credit losses. 

To determine the allowance for credit losses, the firm classifies its loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost into wholesale and consumer portfolios. These portfolios represent the level at which the firm has developed and documented its methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and asset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. 

The allowance for credit losses takes into account the weighted average of a range of forecasts of future economic conditions over the expected life of the loan and lending commitments. The expected life of each loan or lending commitment is determined based on the contractual term adjusted for extension options or demand features, or is modeled in the case of revolving credit card loans. The forecasts include baseline, favorable and adverse economic scenarios over a three-year period. For loans with expected lives beyond three years, the model reverts to historical loss information based on a non-linear

modeled approach. The forecasted economic scenarios consider a number of risk factors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios described below. The firm applies judgment in weighing individual scenarios each quarter based on a variety of factors, including the firm&#8217;s internally derived economic outlook, market consensus, recent macroeconomic conditions and industry trends. 

The allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative components which allow management to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk.

Management&#8217;s estimate of credit losses entails judgment about loan collectability at the reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. The allowance for credit losses is subject to a governance process that involves review and approval by senior management within the firm&#8217;s independent risk oversight and control functions. Personnel within the firm&#8217;s independent risk oversight and control functions are responsible for forecasting the economic variables that underlie the economic scenarios that are used in the modeling of expected credit losses. While management uses the best information available to determine this estimate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, among other things, changes in the economic environment or variances between actual results and the original assumptions used. 

The table below presents gross loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost by portfolio.

These credit card lines are cancellable by the firm. Credit card lending commitments also included approximately $ 2.0 billion as of December 2021 related to a commitment to acquire the General Motors co-branded

credit card portfolio. 

##TABLE_END See Note 18 for further information about lending commitments. 

The following is a description of the methodology used to calculate the allowance for credit losses: 

Wholesale.

The allowance for credit losses for wholesale loans and lending commitments that exhibit similar risk characteristics is measured using a modeled approach. These models determine the probability of default and loss given default based on various risk factors, including internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators, the borrower&#8217;s capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower&#8217;s country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. For lending commitments, the methodology also considers probability of drawdowns or funding. In addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include the loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio and home price index. The most significant inputs to the forecast model for wholesale loans and lending commitments include unemployment rates, GDP, credit spreads, commercial and industrial delinquency rates, short- and long-term interest rates, and oil prices. 

The allowance for loan losses for wholesale loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, such as nonaccrual loans or loans in a TDR, is calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s original effective rate, the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral. 

Wholesale loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when deemed to be uncollectible. 

Consumer.

The allowance for credit losses for consumer loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics is calculated using a modeled approach which classifies consumer loans into pools based on borrower-related and exposure-related characteristics that differentiate a pool&#8217;s risk characteristics from other pools. The factors considered in determining a pool are generally consistent with the risk characteristics used for internal credit risk measurement and management and include key metrics, such as FICO credit scores, delinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic indicators. The most significant inputs to the forecast model for consumer loans include unemployment rates and delinquency rates. The expected life of revolving credit card loans is determined by modeling expected future draws and the timing and amount of repayments allocated to the funded balance. The firm also recognizes an allowance for credit losses on commitments to acquire loans. However, no allowance for credit losses is recognized on credit card lending commitments as they are cancellable by the firm.

##TABLE_END Allowance for Credit Losses Commentary 

Year Ended December 2021.

The allowance for credit losses decreased by $ 82 million during 2021. 

The provision for credit losses reflected growth in the firm&#8217;s lending portfolios, primarily in the consumer portfolio related to credit cards, including a provision for credit losses of approximately 

$ 185 &#160;

million relating to the commitment to acquire the General Motors co-branded

credit card portfolio, largely offset by reserve reduction driven by improved broader economic environment. 

Net charge-offs for 2021 for wholesale loans were primarily related to corporate loans and net charge-offs for consumer loans were primarily related to credit cards. 

Forecast model inputs as of December 2021.

When modeling expected credit losses, the firm employs a weighted, multi-scenario forecast, which includes baseline, adverse and favorable economic scenarios. As of December 2021, this multi-scenario forecast was primarily weighted towards the baseline economic scenario. 

The table below presents the forecasted U.S. unemployment and U.S. GDP growth rates used in the baseline economic scenario of the forecast model.

Given the complex nature of the forecasting process, no single economic variable can be viewed in isolation and independently of other inputs. 

##TABLE_END Year Ended December 2020.

The allowance for credit losses increased by $ 2.63 billion during 2020 reflecting $ 679 million relating to the impact of CECL adoption and $ 1.95 billion from activity during the period. 

The provision for credit losses for wholesale and consumer loans reflected the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19)

pandemic on economic conditions, which resulted in higher modeled expected losses and lower recoveries. In addition, the provision for credit losses for wholesale loans was impacted by asset-specific provisions and ratings downgrades primarily related to borrowers in the diversified industrials, technology, media &#38; telecommunications and natural resources industries. Besides the weaker economic outlook related to the COVID-19

pandemic, the provision for credit losses for consumer loans for 2020 was also impacted by the growth of the credit card portfolio. 

Net charge-offs for 2020 for wholesale loans were primarily related to corporate loans and net charge-offs for consumer loans were primarily related to installment loans.

In the table above: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of loan. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Weighted averages are calculated by weighting each input by the relative fair value of the loan. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; The ranges and weighted averages of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one loan. For example, the highest yield for residential real estate loans is appropriate for valuing a specific residential real estate loan but may not be appropriate for valuing any other residential real estate loan. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 loans. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Increases in yield or duration used in the valuation of level 3 loans would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement, while increases in recovery rate would have resulted in a higher fair value measurement as of both December 2021 and December 2020. Due to the distinctive nature of each level 3 loan, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Loans are valued using discounted cash flows.

Year Ended December 2021.

The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 loans of $ 66 million (reflecting $ 99 million of net realized gains and $ 33 million of net unrealized losses) for 2021 included gains of $ 42 million reported in other principal transactions and $ 24 million reported in interest income. 

The drivers of the net unrealized losses on level 3 loans for 2021 were not material. 

Transfers into level 3 loans during 2021 primarily reflected transfers of certain loans backed by commercial real estate from level 2 (principally due to certain unobservable yield and duration inputs becoming significant to the valuation of these instruments) and transfers of certain corporate loans from level 2 (principally due to reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence, including fewer market transactions in these instruments).

Transfers out of level 3 loans during 2021 primarily reflected transfers of certain corporate loans and wealth management and other loans to level 2 (in each case, principally due to increased price transparency as a result of market evidence, including market transactions in these instruments). 

Year Ended December 2020.

The net realized and unrealized gains on level 3 loans of $ 159 million (reflecting $ 72 million of net realized gains and $ 87 million of net unrealized gains) for 2020 included gains of $ 135 million reported in other principal transactions and $ 24 million reported in interest income. 

The drivers of the net unrealized gains on level 3 loans for 2020 were not material. 

Transfers into level 3 loans during 2020 reflected transfers of certain loans backed by commercial real estate, corporate loans, and wealth management and other loans from level 2 (in each case, principally due to reduced price transparency as a result of a lack of market evidence, including fewer market transactions in these instruments). 

Transfers out of level 3 loans during 2020 reflected transfers of certain corporate loans to level 2 (principally due to duration and yield inputs no longer being significant to the valuation of these loans and increased price transparency as a result of increased market evidence, including market transactions in these instruments). 

Estimated Fair Value

Note 10. 

Fair Value Option 

Other Financial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value 

In addition to trading assets and liabilities, and certain investments and loans, the firm accounts for certain of its other financial assets and liabilities at fair value, substantially all under the fair value option. The primary reasons for electing the fair value option are to: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Reflect economic events in earnings on a timely basis; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Mitigate volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes (e.g., transfers of financial assets accounted for as financings are recorded at fair value, whereas the related secured financing would be recorded on an accrual basis absent electing the fair value option); and 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Address simplification and cost-benefit considerations (e.g., accounting for hybrid financial instruments at fair value in their entirety versus bifurcation of embedded derivatives and hedge accounting for debt hosts). 

##TABLE_END Hybrid financial instruments are instruments that contain bifurcatable embedded derivatives and do not require settlement by physical delivery of nonfinancial assets (e.g., physical commodities). If the firm elects to bifurcate the embedded derivative from the associated debt, the derivative is accounted for at fair value and the host contract is accounted for at amortized cost, adjusted for the effective portion of any fair value hedges. If the firm does not elect to bifurcate, the entire hybrid financial instrument is accounted for at fair value under the fair value option. 

Other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value under the fair value option include: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Resale and repurchase agreements; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Certain securities borrowed and loaned transactions; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Certain customer and other receivables and certain other liabilities; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Certain time deposits (deposits with no stated maturity are not eligible for a fair value option election), including structured certificates of deposit, which are hybrid financial instruments; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Substantially all other secured financings, including transfers of assets accounted for as financings; and 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Certain unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, substantially all of which are hybrid financial instruments.

See Note 4 for an overview of the firm&#8217;s fair value measurement policies and the valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of other financial assets and liabilities. 

Significant Unobservable Inputs 

See below for information about the significant unobservable inputs used to value level 3 other financial assets and liabilities at fair value as of both December 2021 and December 2020. 

Other Secured Financings.

The ranges and weighted averages of significant unobservable inputs used to value level 3 other secured financings are presented below. These ranges and weighted averages exclude unobservable inputs that are only relevant to a single instrument, and therefore are not meaningful. 

As of December 2021: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Yield: 1.3 % to 6.4 % (weighted average: 2.1 %) 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Duration: 0.6 to 7.1 years (weighted average: 3.7 years) 

##TABLE_END As of December 2020: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Yield: 1.4 % to 7.1 % (weighted average: 2.7 %) 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Duration: 1.4 to 8.0 years (weighted average: 4.0 years) 

##TABLE_END Generally, increases in yield or duration, in isolation, would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement as of period-end.

Due to the distinctive nature of each of level 3 other secured financings, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform across such financings. See Note 11 for further information about other secured financings. 

Deposits, Unsecured Borrowings and Other Liabilities.

Substantially all of the firm&#8217;s deposits, unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, and other liabilities that are classified in level 3 are hybrid financial instruments. As the significant unobservable inputs used to value hybrid financial instruments primarily relate to the embedded derivative component of these deposits, unsecured borrowings and other liabilities, these unobservable inputs are incorporated in the firm&#8217;s derivative disclosures in Note 7. See Note 13 for further information about deposits, Note 14 for further information about unsecured borrowings and Note 15 for further information about other liabilities. 

Repurchase Agreements.

As of December 2021, the firm had no level 3 repurchase agreements. As of December 2020, the firm&#8217;s level 3 repurchase agreements were not material.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

&#160;

The net unrealized gains on level 3 other financial liabilities for 2021 primarily reflected gains on certain hybrid financial instruments included in unsecured long- and short-term borrowings (principally due to an increase in interest rates). 

Transfers into level 3 other financial liabilities during 2021 primarily reflected transfers of certain hybrid financial instruments included in unsecured long- and short-term borrowings from level 2 (principally due to reduced price transparency of certain volatility and correlation inputs used to value these instruments) and certain other secured financings from level 2 (principally due to reduced price transparency of certain yield and duration inputs used to value these instruments). 

Transfers out of level 3 other financial liabilities during 2021 primarily reflected transfers of certain hybrid financial instruments included in unsecured long- and short-term borrow in

gs to level 2 (principally due to increased price transparency of certain volatility and correlation inputs used to value these instruments, and certain unobservable volatility inputs no longer being significant to the valuation of these instruments) and certain other secured financings to level 2 (principally due to increased price transparency of certain yield and duration inputs used to value these instruments). 

Year Ended December 2020.

The net realized and unrealized losses on level 3 other financial liabilities of $ 1.62 billion (reflecting $ 317 million of net realized losses and $ 1.30 billion of net unrealized losses) for 2020 included losses of $ 1.44 billion reported in market making, $ 28 million reported in other principal transactions and $ 15 million reported in interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings, and $ 139 million reported in debt valuation adjustment in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 

The net unrealized losses on level 3 other financial liabilities for 2020 primarily reflected losses on certain hybrid financial instruments included in unsecured long- and short-term borrowings (principally due to an increase in global equity prices), and losses on certain hybrid financial instruments included in deposits (principally due to an increase in the market value of the underlying assets). 

Transfers into level 3 other financial liabilities during 2020 primarily reflected transfers of certain other secured financings from level 2 (principally due to reduced price transparency of certain yield and duration inputs used to value these instruments), and certain hybrid financial instruments included in unsecured long- and short-term borrowings from level 2 (principally due to reduced price transparency of certain volatility and correlation inputs used to value these instruments). 

Transfers out of level 3 other financial liabilities during 2020 primarily reflected transfers of certain hybrid financial instruments included in unsecured short-term borrowings to level 2 (principally due to increased price transparency of certain volatility and correlation inputs used to value these instruments).

See Note 8 for information about gains/(losses) on equity securities and Note 9 for information about gains/(losses) on loans which are accounted for at fair value under the fair value option. Gains/(losses) on trading assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value under the fair value option are included in market making. See Note 5 for further information about gains/(losses) from market making. 

Long-Term Debt Instruments 

The difference between the aggregate contractual principal amount and the related fair value of long-term other secured financings, for which the fair value option was elected, was not material as of both December 2021 and December 2020. 

The difference between the aggregate contractual principal amount and the related fair value of unsecured long-term borrowings, for which the fair value option was elected, was no t material as of December 2021, and the fair value exceeded the aggregate contractual principal amount by $ 445 million as of December 2020. The amount above includes both principal-protected and non-principal-protected

long-term borrowings. 

Debt Valuation Adjustment 

The firm calculates the fair value of financial liabilities for which the fair value option is elected by discounting future cash flows at a rate which incorporates the firm&#8217;s credit spreads. 

The table below presents information about the net debt valuation adjustment (DVA) gains/(losses) on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected.

&#160; ##TABLE_END 

In the table above, the aggregate contractual principal amount of loans on nonaccrual status and/or more than 90 days past due (which excludes loans carried at zero fair value and considered uncollectible) exceeds the related fair value primarily because the firm regularly purchases loans, such as distressed loans, at values significantly below the contractual principal amounts. 

The fair value of unfunded lending commitments for which the fair value option was elected was a liability of $ 20 million as of December 2021 and $ 25 million as of December 2020, and the related total contractual amount of these lending commitments was $ 611 million as of December 2021 and $ 1.64 billion as of December 2020. See Note 18 for further information about lending commitments. 

Impact of Credit Spreads on Loans and Lending Commitments 

The estimated net gain/(loss) attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit spreads on loans and lending commitments for which the fair value option was elected was $ 277 million for 2021, $( 106 ) million for 2020 and $ 134 million for 2019. The firm generally calculates the fair value of loans and lending commitments for which the fair value option is elected by discounting future cash flows at a rate which incorporates the instrument-specific credit spreads. For floating-rate loans and lending commitments, substantially all changes in fair value are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit spreads, whereas for fixed-rate loans and lending commitments, changes in fair value are also attributable to changes in interest rates.

&#160;

Note 11. 

Collateralized Agreements and Financings 

&#160;

Collateralized agreements are resale agreements and securities borrowed. Collateralized financings are repurchase agreements, securities loaned and other secured financings. The firm enters into these transactions in order to, among other things, facilitate client activities, invest excess cash, acquire securities to cover short positions and finance certain firm activities. 

Collateralized agreements and financings are presented on a net-by-counterparty

basis when a legal right of setoff exists. Interest on collateralized agreements, which is included in interest income, and collateralized financings, which is included in interest expense, is recognized over the life of the transaction. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense. 

Resale and Repurchase Agreements 

A resale agreement is a transaction in which the firm purchases financial instruments from a seller, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to resell the same or substantially the same financial instruments to the seller at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date. 

A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the firm sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date. 

Even though repurchase and resale agreements (including &#8220;repos- and reverses-to-maturity&#8221;)

involve the legal transfer of ownership of financial instruments, they are accounted for as financing arrangements because they require the financial instruments to be repurchased or resold before or at the maturity of the agreement. The financial instruments purchased or sold in resale and repurchase agreements typically include U.S. government and agency, and investment-grade sovereign obligations. 

The firm receives financial instruments purchased under resale agreements and makes delivery of financial instruments sold under repurchase agreements. To mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors the market value of these financial instruments on a daily basis, and delivers or obtains additional collateral due to changes in the market value of the financial instruments, as appropriate. For resale agreements, the firm typically requires collateral with a fair value approximately equal to the carrying value of the relevant assets in the consolidated balance sheets. 

Securities Borrowed and Loaned Transactions 

In a securities borrowed transaction, the firm borrows securities from a counterparty in exchange for cash or securities. When the firm returns the securities, the counterparty returns the cash or securities. Interest is generally paid periodically over the life of the transaction. 

In a securities loaned transaction, the firm lends securities to a counterparty in exchange for cash or securities. When the counterparty returns the securities, the firm returns the cash or securities posted as collateral. Interest is generally paid periodically over the life of the transaction. 

The firm receives securities borrowed and makes delivery of securities loaned. To mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors the market value of these securities on a daily basis, and delivers or obtains additional collateral due to changes in the market value of the securities, as appropriate. For securities borrowed transactions, the firm typically requires collateral with a fair value approximately equal to the carrying value of the securities borrowed transaction. 

Securities borrowed and loaned within Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) financing are recorded at fair value under the fair value option. See Note 10 for further information about securities borrowed and loaned accounted for at fair value. 

Substantially all of securities borrowed and loaned within Equities financing are recorded based on the amount of cash collateral advanced or received plus accrued interest. The firm also reviews such securities borrowed to determine if an allowance for credit losses should be recorded by taking into consideration the fair value of collateral received. As these agreements generally can be terminated on demand, they exhibit little, if any, sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Therefore, the carrying value of such agreements approximates fair value. As these agreements are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these agreements been included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy, they would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2021 and December 2020.

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Other structured financing arrangements. 

##TABLE_END Other secured financings included nonrecourse arrangements. Nonrecourse other secured financings were $ 8.64 billion as of December 2021 and $ 12.31 billion as of December 2020. 

The firm has elected to apply the fair value option to substantially all other secured financings because the use of fair value eliminates non-economic

volatility in earnings that would arise from using different measurement attributes. See Note 10 for further information about other secured financings that are accounted for at fair value. 

Other secured financings that are not recorded at fair value are recorded based on the amount of cash received plus accrued interest, which generally approximates fair value. As these financings are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these financings been included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 3 as of both December 2021 and December 2020.

The firm receives cash and securities (e.g., U.S. government and agency obligations, other sovereign and corporate obligations, as well as equity securities) as collateral, primarily in connection with resale agreements, securities borrowed, derivative transactions and customer margin loans. The firm obtains cash and securities as collateral on an upfront or contingent basis for derivative instruments and collateralized agreements to reduce its credit exposure to individual counterparties. 

In many cases, the firm is permitted to deliver or repledge financial instruments received as collateral when entering into repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions, primarily in connection with secured client financing activities. The firm is also permitted to deliver or repledge these financial instruments in connection with other secured financings, collateralized derivative transactions and firm or customer settlement requirements. 

The firm also pledges certain trading assets in connection with repurchase agreements, securities loaned transactions and other secured financings, and other assets (substantially all real estate and cash) in connection with other secured financings to counterparties who may or may not have the right to deliver or repledge them. 

The table below presents financial instruments at fair value received as collateral that were available to be delivered or repledged and were delivered or repledged.

Property, leasehold improvements and equipment is net of accumulated depreciation and amortization of $ 10.81 billion as of December 2021 and $ 10.12 billion as of December 2020. Property, leasehold improvements and equipment included $ 6.71 billion as of December 2021 and $ 6.54 billion as of December 2020 that the firm uses in connection with its operations, and $ 194 million as of December 2021 and $ 318 million as of December 2020 of foreclosed real estate primarily related to distressed loans that were purchased by the firm. The remainder is held by investment entities, including VIEs, consolidated by the firm. Substantially all property and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease. Capitalized costs of software developed or obtained for internal use are amortized on a straight-line basis over three years . 

The firm tests property, leasehold improvements and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset&#8217;s or asset group&#8217;s carrying value may not be fully recoverable. To the extent the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group, the firm determines the asset or asset group is impaired and records an impairment equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset or asset group. In addition, the firm will recognize an impairment prior to the sale of an asset or asset group if the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. 

The firm had impairments of $ 143 million during 2021 and $ 171 million during 2020, primarily related to properties held by the firm&#8217;s investment entities. There were no material impairments during 2019. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, at the acquisition date.

&#160;

&#160; &#160; $ 4,332 &#160; ##TABLE_END Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative assessment. 

The quantitative goodwill test compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its estimated net book value (including goodwill and identifiable intangible assets). If the reporting unit&#8217;s estimated fair value exceeds its estimated net book value, goodwill is not impaired. An impairment is recognized if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated net book value. 

To estimate the fair value of each reporting unit, other than Consumer banking, a relative value technique is used because the firm believes market participants would use this technique to value these reporting units. The relative value technique applies observable price-to-earnings

multiples or price-to-book

multiples of comparable competitors to reporting units&#8217; net earnings or net book value. To estimate the fair value of Consumer banking, a discounted cash flow valuation approach is used because the firm believes market participants would use this technique to value that reporting unit given its early stage of development. The estimated net carrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders&#8217; equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders&#8217; equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

&#160;

In the fourth quarter of 2021, the firm performed its annual assessment of goodwill for impairment, for each of its reporting units, by performing a qualitative assessment. Multiple factors were assessed with respect to each of the firm&#8217;s reporting units to determine whether it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of any of those reporting units was less than its estimated carrying value. The qualitative assessment also considered changes since a quantitative test was last performed in 2019. 

The firm considered the following factors in the qualitative annual assessment when evaluating whether it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit was less than its estimated carrying value: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Performance Indicators.

During 2021, the firm&#8217;s net revenues, diluted earnings per common share (EPS), return on average common shareholders&#8217; equity and book value per common share all increased from 2020 and from when a quantitative test was last performed in 2019. The firm&#8217;s operating expenses increased, primarily reflecting significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting strong financial performance). Despite the increase in expenses, both the efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided by total net revenues) and pre-tax

margin improved compared with 2020. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Macroeconomic Indicators.

The global economy continued to recover during 2021 from the impact of the COVID-19

pandemic, as the lifting of health and safety restrictions amid vaccine distribution facilitated an increase in global economic recovery, and monetary and fiscal policy from central banks and governments remained accommodative. However, there remains uncertainty related to the impact and the duration of the COVID-19

pandemic. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Firm and Industry Events.

There were no events, entity-specific or otherwise, that would have had a significant negative impact on the valuation of the firm&#8217;s reporting units. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Fair Value Indicators.

Since the 2020 qualitative goodwill test, fair value indicators in the market generally improved, as global equity prices were higher, credit spreads were tighter, and the firm and its peers&#8217; stock prices and price-to-book

multiples were higher. Despite increased inflation concerns, supply chain challenges and the rise in COVID-19 cases in the fourth quarter of 2021, the firm&#8217;s stock price and price-to-book

multiple ended the year higher compared with the end of 2020. 

##TABLE_END 

As a result of the qualitative assessment, the firm determined that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its respective estimated carrying value. Therefore, the firm determined that goodwill for each reporting unit was not impaired and that a quantitative goodwill test was not required.

##TABLE_END The firm tests intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset&#8217;s or asset group&#8217;s carrying value may not be fully recoverable. To the extent the carrying value of an asset or asset group exceeds the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group, the firm determines the asset or asset group is impaired and records an impairment equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset or asset group. In addition, the firm will recognize an impairment prior to the sale of an asset or asset group if the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. There were no material impairments during 2021, 2020 or 2019. 

Operating Lease Right-of-Use

Assets 

The firm enters into operating leases for real estate, office equipment and other assets, substantially all of which are used in connection with its operations. For leases longer than one year, the firm recognizes a right-of-use

asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability representing the liability to make payments. The lease term is generally determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease. For leases where the firm has the option to terminate or extend the lease, an assessment of the likelihood of exercising the option is incorporated into the determination of the lease term. Such assessment is initially performed at the inception of the lease and is updated if events occur that impact the original assessment. 

An operating lease right-of-use

asset is initially determined based on the operating lease liability, adjusted for initial direct costs, lease incentives and amounts paid at or prior to lease commencement. This amount is then amortized over the lease term. The firm recognized $ 305 million for 2021, $ 182 million for 2020 and $ 963 million (primarily related to the firm&#8217;s European headquarters in London) for 2019 of right-of-use

assets and operating lease liabilities in non-cash

transactions for leases entered into or assumed. See Note 15 for information about operating lease liabilities. 

For leases where the firm will derive no economic benefit from leased space that it has vacated or where the firm has shortened the term of a lease when space is no longer needed, the firm will record an impairment or accelerated amortization of right-of-use

assets. There were no material impairments or accelerated amortizations during 2021 and 2020.

As of December 2021, deposits in U.S. offices included $ 25.44 billion and deposits in non-U.S.

offices included $ 32.73 billion of time deposits in denominations that met or exceeded the applicable insurance limits, or were otherwise not covered by insurance. 

The firm&#8217;s savings and demand deposits are recorded based on the amount of cash received plus accrued interest , which approximates fair value. In addition, the firm designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges to convert a portion of its time deposits not accounted for at fair value from fixed-rate obligations into floating-rate obligations. The carrying value of time deposits not accounted for at fair value approximated fair value as of both December 2021 and December 2020. As these savings and demand deposits and time deposits are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these deposits been included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy, they would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2021 and December 2020.

Unsecured short-term borrowings includes the portion of unsecured long-term borrowings maturing within one year of the financial statement date and unsecured long-term borrowings that are redeemable within one year of the financial statement date at the option of the holder. 

The firm accounts for certain hybrid financial instruments at fair value under the fair value option. See Note 10 for further information about unsecured short-term borrowings that are accounted for at fair value. In addition, the firm designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges to convert a portion of its unsecured short-term borrowings not accounted for at fair value from fixed-rate obligations into floating-rate obligations. The carrying value of unsecured short-term borrowings that are not recorded at fair value generally approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the obligations. As these unsecured short-term borrowings are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these borrowings been included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2021 and December 2020.

These rates exclude unsecured long-term borrowings accounted for at fair value under the fair value option. 

The carrying value of unsecured long-term borrowings for which the firm did not elect the fair value option was $ 201.70 billion as of December 2021 and $ 172.57 billion as of December 2020. The estimated fair value of such unsecured long-term borrowings was $ 209.37 billion as of December 2021 and $ 183.29 billion as of December 2020. As these borrowings are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 through 10. Had these borrowings been included in the firm&#8217;s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both December 2021 and December 2020. 

Subordinated Borrowings 

Unsecured long-term borrowings includes subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt. Subordinated debt that matures within one year is included in unsecured short-term borrowings. Junior subordinated debt is junior in right of payment to other subordinated borrowings, which are junior to senior borrowings. Long-term subordinated debt had maturities ranging from 2025 to 2045 as of both December 2021 and December 2020.

##TABLE_END Junior Subordinated Debt 

In 2004, Group Inc. issued $ 2.84 billion of junior subordinated debt to Goldman Sachs Capital I (Trust), a Delaware statutory trust. The Trust issued $ 2.75 billion of guaranteed preferred beneficial interests (Trust Preferred securities) to third parties and $ 85 million of common beneficial interests to Group Inc. As of both December 2021 and December 2020, the outstanding par amount of junior subordinated debt held by the Trust was $ 968 million and the outstanding par amount of Trust Preferred securities and common beneficial interests issued by the Trust was $ 939 million and $ 29 million, respectively. The Trust is a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the firm for regulatory and legal purposes but is not consolidated for accounting purposes.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

&#160;

The firm pays interest semi-annually on the junior subordinated debt at an annual rate of 6.345 % and the debt matures on February 15, 2034 . The coupon rate and the payment dates applicable to the beneficial interests are the same as the interest rate and payment dates for the junior subordinated debt. The firm has the right, from time to time, to defer payment of interest on the junior subordinated debt, and therefore cause payment on the Trust&#8217;s preferred beneficial interests to be deferred, in each case up to ten consecutive semi-annual periods. During any such deferral period, the firm will not be permitted to, among other things, pay dividends on or make certain repurchases of its common stock. The Trust is not permitted to pay any distributions on the common beneficial interests held by Group Inc. unless all dividends payable on the preferred beneficial interests have been paid in full. 

The firm has covenanted in favor of the holders of Group Inc.&#8217;s 6.345 % junior subordinated debt due February 15, 2034 , that, subject to certain exceptions, the firm will not redeem or purchase the capital securities issued by Goldman Sachs Capital II and Goldman Sachs Capital III (APEX Trusts) or shares of Group Inc.&#8217;s Perpetual Non-Cumulative

Preferred Stock, Series E (Series E Preferred Stock), Perpetual Non-Cumulative

Preferred Stock, Series F (Series F Preferred Stock) or Perpetual Non-Cumulative

Preferred Stock, Series O, if the redemption or purchase results in less than $ 253 million aggregate liquidation preference of that series outstanding, prior to specified dates in 2022 for a price that exceeds a maximum amount determined by reference to the net cash proceeds that the firm has received from the sale of qualifying securities. 

The APEX Trusts hold Group Inc.&#8217;s Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock. These trusts are Delaware statutory trusts sponsored by the firm and wholly-owned finance subsidiaries of the firm for regulatory and legal purposes but are not consolidated for accounting purposes.

Operating lease costs were $ 463 million for 2021, $ 458 million for 2020 and $ 538 million for 2019. Variable lease costs, which are included in operating lease costs, were not material for 2021, 2020 and 2019. Total occupancy expenses for space held in excess of the firm&#8217;s current requirements were not material for both 2021 and 2020.

##TABLE_END Note 16. 

Securitization Activities 

The firm securitizes residential and commercial mortgages, corporate bonds, loans and other types of financial assets by selling these assets to securitization vehicles (e.g., trusts, corporate entities and limited liability companies) or through a resecuritization. The firm acts as underwriter of the beneficial interests that are sold to investors. The firm&#8217;s residential mortgage securitizations are primarily in connection with government agency securitizations. 

The firm accounts for a securitization as a sale when it has relinquished control over the transferred financial assets. Prior to securitization, the firm generally accounts for assets pending transfer at fair value and therefore does not typically recognize significant gains or losses upon the transfer of assets. Net revenues from underwriting activities are recognized in connection with the sales of the underlying beneficial interests to investors. 

The firm generally receives cash in exchange for the transferred assets but may also have continuing involvement with the transferred financial assets, including ownership of beneficial interests in securitized financial assets, primarily in the form of debt instruments. The firm may also purchase senior or subordinated securities issued by securitization vehicles (which are typically VIEs) in connection with secondary market-making activities. 

The primary risks included in beneficial interests and other interests from the firm&#8217;s continuing involvement with securitization vehicles are the performance of the underlying collateral, the position of the firm&#8217;s investment in the capital structure of the securitization vehicle and the market yield for the security. Interests accounted for at fair value are primarily classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Interests not accounted for at fair value are carried at amounts that approximate fair value. See Notes 4 through 10 for further information about fair value measurements. 

The table below presents the amount of financial assets securitized and the cash flows received on retained interests in securitization entities in which the firm had continuing involvement as of the end of the period.

Due to the nature and fair value of certain of these retained interests, the weighted average assumptions for constant prepayment and discount rates and the related sensitivity to adverse changes are not meaningful as of both December 2021 and December 2020. The firm&#8217;s maximum exposure to adverse changes in the value of these interests is the carrying value of $ 360 million as of December 2021 and $ 192 million as of December 2020.

Note 17. 

Variable Interest Entities 

&#160;

A variable interest in a VIE is an investment (e.g., debt or equity) or other interest (e.g., derivatives or loans and lending commitments) that will absorb portions of the VIE&#8217;s expected losses and/or receive portions of the VIE&#8217;s expected residual returns. 

The firm&#8217;s variable interests in VIEs include senior and subordinated debt; loans and lending commitments; limited and general partnership interests; preferred and common equity; derivatives that may include foreign currency, equity and/or credit risk; guarantees; and certain of the fees the firm receives from investment funds. Certain interest rate, foreign currency and credit derivatives the firm enters into with VIEs are not variable interests because they create, rather than absorb, risk. 

VIEs generally finance the purchase of assets by issuing debt and equity securities that are either collateralized by or indexed to the assets held by the VIE. The debt and equity securities issued by a VIE may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. The firm&#8217;s involvement with VIEs includes securitization of financial assets, as described in Note 16, and investments in and loans to other types of VIEs, as described below. See Note 3 for the firm&#8217;s consolidation policies, including the definition of a VIE. 

VIE Consolidation Analysis 

The enterprise with a controlling financial interest in a VIE is known as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by performing an analysis that principally considers: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Which variable interest holder has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE&#8217;s economic performance; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Which variable interest holder has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; The VIE&#8217;s purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; The VIE&#8217;s capital structure; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; The terms between the VIE and its variable interest holders and other parties involved with the VIE; and 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Related-party relationships. 

##TABLE_END 

The firm reassesses its evaluation of whether an entity is a VIE when certain reconsideration events occur. The firm reassesses its determination of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on current facts and circumstances. 

VIE Activities 

The firm is principally involved with VIEs through the following business activities: 

Mortgage-Backed VIEs.

The firm sells residential and commercial mortgage loans and securities to mortgage-backed VIEs and may retain beneficial interests in the assets sold to these VIEs. The firm purchases and sells beneficial interests issued by mortgage-backed VIEs in connection with market-making activities. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives with certain of these VIEs, primarily interest rate swaps, which are typically not variable interests. The firm generally enters into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk. 

Real Estate, Credit- and Power-Related and Other Investing VIEs.

The firm purchases equity and debt securities issued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold real estate, performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans, power-related assets and equity securities. The firm generally does not sell assets to, or enter into derivatives with, these VIEs. 

Corporate Debt and Other Asset-Backed VIEs.

The firm structures VIEs that issue notes to clients, purchases and sells beneficial interests issued by corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs in connection with market-making activities, and makes loans to VIEs that warehouse corporate debt. Certain of these VIEs synthetically create the exposure for the beneficial interests they issue by entering into credit derivatives with the firm, rather than purchasing the underlying assets. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives, such as total return swaps, with certain corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs, under which the firm pays the VIE a return due to the beneficial interest holders and receives the return on the collateral owned by the VIE. The collateral owned by these VIEs is primarily other asset-backed loans and securities. The firm may be removed as the total return swap counterparty and may enter into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk related to these swaps. The firm may sell assets to the corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs it structures.

Principal-Protected Note VIEs.

The firm structures VIEs that issue principal-protected notes to clients. These VIEs own portfolios of assets, principally with exposure to hedge funds. Substantially all of the principal protection on the notes issued by these VIEs is provided by the asset portfolio rebalancing that is required under the terms of the notes. The firm enters into total return swaps with these VIEs under which the firm pays the VIE the return due to the principal-protected note holders and receives the return on the assets owned by the VIE. The firm may enter into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk. The firm also obtains funding through these VIEs. 

Investments in Funds.

The firm makes equity investments in certain investment fund VIEs it manages and is entitled to receive fees from these VIEs. The firm has generally not sold assets to, or entered into derivatives with, these VIEs. 

Nonconsolidated VIEs 

The table below presents a summary of the nonconsolidated VIEs in which the firm holds variable interests.

##TABLE_END In the tables above, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, the firm&#8217;s commitments under letters of credit, issued by various banks which the firm provides to counterparties to satisfy certain collateral and margin deposit requirements, is included in other commitments. Previously, such letters of credit were disclosed as a separate line item in the tables above. Previously reported amounts have been conformed to the current presentation. 

Lending Commitments 

The firm&#8217;s commercial and warehouse financing lending commitments are agreements to lend with fixed termination dates and depend on the satisfaction of all contractual conditions to borrowing. These commitments are presented net of amounts syndicated to third parties. The total commitment amount does not necessarily reflect actual future cash flows because the firm may syndicate portions of these commitments. In addition, commitments can expire unused or be reduced or cancelled at the counterparty&#8217;s request. The firm also provides credit to consumers by issuing credit card lines. 

The table below presents information about lending commitments.

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Held for investment lending commitments are accounted for at amortized cost. The carrying value of lending commitments was a liability of $ 1.05 billion (including allowance for credit losses of $ 776 million) as of December 2021 and $ 775 million (including allowance for credit losses of $ 557 million) as of December 2020. The estimated fair value of such lending commitments was a liability of $ 4.17 billion as of December 2021 and $ 4.05 billion as of December 2020. Had these lending commitments been carried at fair value and included in the fair value hierarchy, $ 1.91 billion as of December 2021 and $ 2.43 billion as of December 2020 would have been classified in level 2, and $ 2.26 billion as of December 2021 and $ 1.62 billion as of December 2020 would have been classified in level 3. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Held for sale lending commitments are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value. The carrying value of lending commitments held for sale was a liability of $ 91 million as of December 2021 and $ 68 million as of December 2020. The estimated fair value of such lending commitments approximates the carrying value. Had these lending commitments been included in the fair value hierarchy, they would have been primarily classified in level 3 as of both December 2021 and December 2020.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Commercial Lending.

The firm&#8217;s commercial lending commitments were primarily extended to investment-grade corporate borrowers. Such commitments primarily included $ 120.99 billion as of December 2021 and $ 110.31 billion as of December 2020, related to relationship lending activities (principally used for operating and general corporate purposes) and $ 21.07 billion as of December 2021 and $ 15.81 billion as of December 2020, related to other investment banking activities (generally extended for contingent acquisition financing and are often intended to be short-term in nature, as borrowers often seek to replace them with other funding sources). The firm also extends lending commitments in connection with other types of corporate lending, as well as commercial real estate financing. See Note 9 for further information about funded loans. 

To mitigate the credit risk associated with the firm&#8217;s commercial lending activities, the firm obtains credit protection on certain loans and lending commitments through credit default swaps, both single-name and index-based contracts, and through the issuance of credit-linked notes. 

Warehouse Financing.

The firm provides financing to clients who warehouse financial assets. These arrangements are secured by the warehoused assets, primarily consisting of residential real estate, consumer and corporate loans. 

Credit Cards.

The firm&#8217;s credit card lending commitments included $ 33.97 billion as of December 2021 and $ 21.64 billion as of December 2020 related to credit card lines issued by the firm to consumers. These credit card lines are cancellable by the firm. Credit card commitments also includes approximately $ 2.0 billion relating to the firm&#8217;s commitment to acquire a credit card portfolio in connection with its agreement, in January 2021, to form a co-branded

credit card relationship with General Motors. This acquisition was completed in February 2022. 

Risk Participations 

The firm also risk participates certain of its commercial lending commitments to other financial institutions. In the event of a risk participant&#8217;s default, the firm will be responsible to fund the borrower. 

Collateralized Agreement Commitments/Collateralized Financing Commitments 

Collateralized agreement commitments includes forward starting resale and securities borrowing agreements, and collateralized financing commitments includes forward starting repurchase and secured lending agreements that settle at a future date, generally within three business days. Collateralized agreement commitments also includes transactions where the firm has entered into commitments to provide contingent financing to its clients and counterparties through resale agreements. The firm&#8217;s funding of these commitments depends on the satisfaction of all contractual conditions to the resale agreement and these commitments can expire unused. 

Investment Commitments 

Investment commitments includes commitments to invest in private equity, real estate and other assets directly and through funds that the firm raises and manages. Investment commitments included $ 1.60 billion as of December 2021 and $ 1.69 billion as of December 2020, related to commitments to invest in funds managed by the firm. If these commitments are called, they would be funded at market value on the date of investment. 

Investment commitments also included approximately $ 1.90 billion as of December 2021 related to the firm&#8217;s commitment to acquire NN Investment Partners, a leading European asset manager with approximately $ 320 &#160;

billion in assets under supervision, in an all-cash

transaction. This acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022. In addition, investment commitments included approximately $ 2.0 &#160;

billion as of December 2021 related to the firm&#8217;s commitment to acquire GreenSky, Inc. (GreenSky), a leading technology company facilitating point-of-sale financing for merchants and consumers. This acquisition is expected to close in

the first quarter of 2022. The GreenSky acquisition will be an all-stock

transaction in which stockholders of GreenSky and unit holders of GreenSky Holdings, LLC (GreenSky Holdings) will receive 0.03 shares of the firm&#8217;s common stock for each share of GreenSky Class A common stock and each GreenSky Holdings common unit. The investment commitment in the table above represents the purchase price of the acquisition based on the stock price of Group Inc. as of December 2021. However, the final purchase price of the acquisition will depend upon the stock price of Group Inc. at the time of the closing of the transaction. In connection with this transaction, the firm provided a commitment to acquire up to 

$ 800 million of loans originated by GreenSky&#8217;s bank partners, and, as of December 2021, had acquired approximately $ 200 million of loans under this commitment. The remaining commitment of approximately $ 600 &#160; million is included in other commitments in the table above. In the event that the acquisition is not completed, the firm has agreed to provide a commitment to purchase up to an additional $ 1.0 billion of loans originated by GreenSky&#8217;s bank partners. This commitment is not included in the table above.

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; The carrying value for derivatives included derivative assets of $ 1.10 billion as of December 2021 and $ 1.66 billion as of December 2020, and derivative liabilities of $ 4.51 billion as of December 2021 and $ 6.02 billion as of December 2020. 

##TABLE_END 

Derivative Guarantees.

The firm enters into various derivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including written equity and commodity put options, written currency contracts and interest rate caps, floors and swaptions. These derivatives are risk managed together with derivatives that do not meet the definition of a guarantee, and therefore the amounts in the table above do not reflect the firm&#8217;s overall risk related to derivative activities. Disclosures about derivatives are not required if they may be cash settled and the firm has no basis to conclude it is probable that the counterparties held the underlying instruments at inception of the contract. The firm has concluded that these conditions have been met for certain large, internationally active commercial and investment bank counterparties, central clearing counterparties, hedge funds and certain other counterparties.

Accordingly, the firm has not included such contracts in the table above. See Note 7 for information about credit derivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee, which are not included in the table above. 

Derivatives are accounted for at fair value and therefore the carrying value is considered the best indication of payment/performance risk for individual contracts. However, the carrying values in the table above exclude the effect of counterparty and cash collateral netting. 

Securities Lending and Clearing Guarantees.

Securities lending and clearing guarantees include the indemnifications and guarantees that the firm provides in its capacity as an agency lender and in its capacity as a sponsoring member of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. 

As an agency lender, the firm indemnifies most of its securities lending customers against losses incurred in the event that borrowers do not return securities and the collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the securities borrowed. The maximum payout of such indemnifications was $ 11.05 billion as of December 2021 and $ 19.86 billion as of December 2020. Collateral held by the lenders in connection with securities lending indemnifications was $ 11.36 billion as of December 2021 and $ 20.39 billion as of December 2020. Because the contractual nature of these arrangements requires the firm to obtain collateral with a market value that exceeds the value of the securities lent to the borrower, there is minimal performance risk associated with these indemnifications.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

&#160;

As a sponsoring member of the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, the firm guarantees the performance of its sponsored member clients to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation in connection with certain resale and repurchase agreements. To minimize potential losses on such guarantees, the firm obtains a security interest in the collateral that the sponsored client placed with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. Therefore, the risk of loss on such guarantees is minimal. There were no amounts outstanding under the guarantee as of December 2021. As of December 2020, the maximum payout on this guarantee was $ 1.49 billion and the related collateral held was $ 1.50 billion. 

Other Financial Guarantees.

In the ordinary course of business, the firm provides other financial guarantees of the obligations of third parties (e.g., standby letters of credit and other guarantees to enable clients to complete transactions and fund-related guarantees). These guarantees represent obligations to make payments to beneficiaries if the guaranteed party fails to fulfill its obligation under a contractual arrangement with that beneficiary. Other financial guarantees also include a guarantee that the firm has provided to the Government of Malaysia that it will receive at least $ 1.4 billion in assets and proceeds from assets seized by governmental authorities around the world related to 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a sovereign wealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB). The firm evaluates progress toward satisfying this obligation based on the report that it receives on a semi-annual basis, expected in February and August. Based on the latest report as of August 2021, approximately $ 450 million in assets or proceeds from assets has been returned to the Government of Malaysia in connection with this guarantee, which must be satisfied by August 18, 2025. Any amounts paid by the firm under this guarantee would be subject to reimbursement in the event the assets or proceeds received by the Government of Malaysia through August 18, 2028 exceeds $ 1.4 billion. See Note 27 for further information about matters related to 1MDB. 

Guarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts.

The firm has established trusts, including Goldman Sachs Capital I, the APEX Trusts and other entities, for the limited purpose of issuing securities to third parties, lending the proceeds to the firm and entering into contractual arrangements with the firm and third parties related to this purpose. The firm does not consolidate these entities. See Note 14 for further information about the transactions involving Goldman Sachs Capital I and the APEX Trusts. 

The firm effectively provides for the full and unconditional guarantee of the securities issued by these entities. Timely payment by the firm of amounts due to these entities under the guarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and related contractual arrangements will be sufficient to cover payments due on the securities issued by these entities. No subsidiary of Group Inc. guarantees the securities of Goldman Sachs Capital I or the APEX Trusts. 

Management believes that it is unlikely that any circumstances will occur, such as nonperformance on the part of paying agents or other service providers, that would make it necessary for the firm to make payments related to these entities other than those required under the terms of the guarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and related contractual arrangements and in connection with certain expenses incurred by these entities. 

Indemnities and Guarantees of Service Providers.

In the ordinary course of business, the firm indemnifies and guarantees certain service providers, such as clearing and custody agents, trustees and administrators, against specified potential losses in connection with their acting as an agent of, or providing services to, the firm or its affiliates. 

The firm may also be liable to some clients or other parties for losses arising from its custodial role or caused by acts or omissions of third-party service providers, including sub-custodians

and third-party brokers. In certain cases, the firm has the right to seek indemnification from these third-party service providers for certain relevant losses incurred by the firm. In addition, the firm is a member of payment, clearing and settlement networks, as well as securities exchanges around the world that may require the firm to meet the obligations of such networks and exchanges in the event of member defaults and other loss scenarios. 

In connection with the firm&#8217;s prime brokerage and clearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear and settle on behalf of its clients the transactions entered into by them with other brokerage firms. The firm&#8217;s obligations in respect of such transactions are secured by the assets in the client&#8217;s account, as well as any proceeds received from the transactions cleared and settled by the firm on behalf of the client. In connection with joint venture investments, the firm may issue loan guarantees under which it may be liable in the event of fraud, misappropriation, environmental liabilities and certain other matters involving the borrower.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

&#160;

The firm is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees and indemnifications. However, management believes that it is unlikely the firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements, and no material liabilities related to these guarantees and indemnifications have been recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of both December 2021 and December 2020. 

Other Representations, Warranties and Indemnifications.

The firm provides representations and warranties to counterparties in connection with a variety of commercial transactions and occasionally indemnifies them against potential losses caused by the breach of those representations and warranties. The firm may also provide indemnifications protecting against changes in or adverse application of certain U.S. tax laws in connection with ordinary-course transactions, such as securities issuances, borrowings or derivatives. 

In addition, the firm may provide indemnifications to some counterparties to protect them in the event additional taxes are owed or payments are withheld, due either to a change in or an adverse application of certain non-U.S.

tax laws. 

These indemnifications generally are standard contractual terms and are entered into in the ordinary course of business. Generally, there are no stated or notional amounts included in these indemnifications, and the contingencies triggering the obligation to indemnify are not expected to occur. The firm is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees and indemnifications. However, management believes that it is unlikely the firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements, and no material liabilities related to these arrangements have been recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of both December 2021 and December 2020. 

Guarantees of Subsidiaries.

Group Inc. is the entity that fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by GS Finance Corp., a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the firm. Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of Goldman Sachs &#38; Co. LLC (GS&#38;Co.), GS Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Paris Inc. et Cie, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, Group Inc. has provided guarantees to Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE) related to agreements that each entity has entered into with certain of its counterparties. Furthermore, Group Inc. provided a guarantee to GS Bank USA in 2020 related to securities that GS Bank USA acquired from certain affiliated funds of Group Inc. and loans and lending commitments that GS Bank USA acquired from certain subsidiaries of Group Inc. As of December 2021, none of the securities acquired from the affiliated funds were outstanding. 

Group Inc. guarantees many of the obligations of its other consolidated subsidiaries on a transaction-by-transaction

basis, as negotiated with counterparties. Group Inc. is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under its subsidiary guarantees. However, because these obligations are also obligations of consolidated subsidiaries, Group Inc.&#8217;s liabilities as guarantor are not separately disclosed. 

Note 19. 

Shareholders&#8217; Equity 

Common Equity 

As of both December 2021 and December 2020, the firm had 4.00 billion authorized shares of common stock and 200 million authorized shares of nonvoting common stock, each with a par value of $ 0.01 per share. 

The firm&#8217;s share repurchase program is intended to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. The share repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1

and accelerated share repurchases), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by the firm&#8217;s current and projected capital position, and capital deployment opportunities, but which may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of the firm&#8217;s common stock. The firm suspended stock repurchases during the first quarter of 2020 and, consistent with the FRB&#8217;s requirement for all large bank holding companies (BHCs), extended the suspension of stock repurchases through the fourth quarter of 2020. The firm resumed stock repurchases in the first quarter of 2021.

Note 20. 

Regulation and Capital Adequacy 

&#160;

The FRB is the primary regulator of Group Inc., a BHC under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and a financial holding company under amendments to this Act. The firm is subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements which are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). 

The capital requirements are expressed as risk-based capital and leverage ratios that compare measures of regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets (RWAs), average assets and off-balance

sheet exposures. Failure to comply with these capital requirements would result in restrictions being imposed by the firm&#8217;s regulators and could limit the firm&#8217;s ability to repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments. The firm&#8217;s capital levels are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings and other factors. Furthermore, certain of the firm&#8217;s subsidiaries are subject to separate regulations and capital requirements. 

Capital Framework 

The regulations under the Capital Framework are largely based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision&#8217;s (Basel Committee) capital framework for strengthening international capital standards (Basel III) and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the Capital Framework, the firm is an &#8220;Advanced approach&#8221; banking organization and has been designated as a global systemically important bank (G-SIB).

The Capital Framework includes the minimum risk-based capital and the capital conservation buffer requirements. The buffer must consist entirely of capital that qualifies as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. 

The firm calculates its CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules. Each of the ratios calculated under the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules must meet its respective capital requirements. 

Under the Capital Framework, the firm is also subject to leverage requirements which consist of a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio and a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), as well as the SLR buffer.

The table below presents the risk-based capital requirements.

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; As of both December 2021 and December 2020, under both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules, the CET1 capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of 4.5 %, the Tier 1 capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of 6.0 % and the Total capital ratio requirement includes a minimum of 8.0 %. These requirements also include the capital conservation buffer requirements, consisting of the G-SIB

surcharge of 2.5 % (Method 2) and the countercyclical capital buffer, which the FRB has set to zero percent. In addition, the capital conservation buffer requirements include the stress capital buffer (SCB) of 6.4 % as of December 2021 and 6.6 % as of December 2020 under the Standardized Capital Rules and a buffer of 2.5 % as of both December 2021 and December 2020 under the Advanced Capital Rules. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; The G-SIB

surcharge is updated annually based on financial data from the prior year and is generally applicable for the following year. The G-SIB

surcharge is calculated using two methodologies, the higher of which is reflected in the firm&#8217;s risk-based capital requirements. The first calculation (Method 1) is based on the Basel Committee&#8217;s methodology which, among other factors, relies upon measures of the size, activity and complexity of each G-SIB.

The second calculation (Method 2) uses similar inputs but includes a measure of reliance on short-term wholesale funding.

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; As permitted by the FRB, the firm elected to temporarily delay the estimated effects of adopting CECL on regulatory capital until January 2022 and to subsequently phase &#160;

in

the effects through January 2025. In addition, the firm elected to increase regulatory capital by 25 % of the increase in the allowance for credit losses since January 1, 2020, as permitted by the rules issued by the FRB. The impact of this increase will also be phased in over the three-year transition period. Reflecting the full impact of CECL as of both December 2021 and December 2020 would not have had a material impact on the firm&#8217;s capital ratios. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; In the third quarter of 2021, based on regulatory feedback, the firm revised certain interpretations of the Capital Rules underlying the calculation of Standardized RWAs. As of December 2020, this change would have increased the firm&#8217;s Standardized RWAs of $ 554 billion by approximately $ 23 billion, which would have reduced the firm&#8217;s Standardized CET1 capital ratio of 14.7 % by 0.6 percentage points, Standardized Tier 1 capital ratio of 16.7 % by 0.6 percentage points and Standardized Total capital ratio of 19.5 % by 0.8 percentage points. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; In December 2021, the firm early adopted the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies&#8217; final rule that implements the new standardized approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR).

SA-CCR

replaced the current exposure method for calculating the exposure amount of derivative contracts for determining Standardized RWAs and supplementary leverage exposure. Adoption of SA-CCR

resulted in a decrease to the firm&#8217;s Standardized CET1 capital ratio by approximately 0.3 percentage points as of December 2021.

RWAs.

RWAs are calculated in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules. 

Credit Risk 

Credit RWAs are calculated based on measures of exposure, which are then risk weighted under the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; The Standardized Capital Rules apply prescribed risk-weights, which depend largely on the type of counterparty. The exposure measure for derivatives and securities financing transactions are based on specific formulas which take certain factors into consideration. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Under the Advanced Capital Rules, the firm computes risk-weights for wholesale and retail credit exposures in accordance with the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based approach. The exposure measures for derivatives and securities financing transactions are computed utilizing internal models. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; For both Standardized and Advanced credit RWAs, the risk-weights for securitizations and equities are based on specific required formulaic approaches. 

##TABLE_END Market Risk 

RWAs for market risk in accordance with the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules are generally consistent. Market RWAs are calculated based on measures of exposure which include the following: 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Value-at-Risk

(VaR) is the potential loss in value of trading assets and liabilities, as well as certain investments, loans, and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

&#160;

For both risk management purposes and regulatory capital calculations, the firm uses a single VaR model which captures risks, including those related to interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. However, VaR used for risk management purposes differs from VaR used for regulatory capital requirements (regulatory VaR) due to differences in time horizons, confidence levels and the scope of positions on which VaR is calculated. For risk management purposes, a 95 % one-day

VaR is used, whereas for regulatory capital requirements, a 99 % 10 -day

VaR is used to determine Market RWAs and a 99 % one-day 

VaR is used to determine regulatory VaR exceptions. In addition, the daily net revenues used to determine risk management VaR exceptions (i.e., comparing the daily net revenues to the VaR measure calculated as of the end of the prior business day) include intraday activity, whereas the Capital Framework requires that intraday activity be excluded from daily net revenues when calculating regulatory VaR exceptions. Intraday activity includes bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature. As a result, there may be differences in the number of VaR exceptions and the amount of daily net revenues calculated for regulatory VaR compared to the amounts calculated for risk management VaR. 

The firm&#8217;s positional losses observed on a single day exceeded its 99 % one-day 

regulatory VaR on one occasion during 2021 and on six occasions during 2020 (all of which occurred during March 2020 and, as permitted by the FRB, did not have any impact on the firm&#8217;s VaR multiplier used to calculate Market RWAs); 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Stressed VaR is the potential loss in value of trading assets and liabilities, as well as certain investments, loans, and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, during a period of significant market stress; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Incremental risk is the potential loss in value of non-securitized

positions due to the default or credit migration of issuers of financial instruments over a one-year

time horizon; 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Comprehensive risk is the potential loss in value, due to price risk and defaults, within the firm&#8217;s credit correlation positions; and 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Specific risk is the risk of loss on a position that could result from factors other than broad market movements, including event risk, default risk and idiosyncratic risk. The standardized measurement method is used to determine specific risk RWAs, by applying supervisory defined risk-weighting factors after applicable netting is performed. 

##TABLE_END 

Operational Risk 

Operational RWAs are only required to be included under the Advanced Capital Rules. The firm utilizes an internal risk-based model to quantify Operational RWAs.

Year Ended December 2021.

Standardized Credit RWAs as of December 2021 increased by $ 114.92 billion compared with December 2020, primarily reflecting an increase in commitments, guarantees and loans (principally due to increased lending activity and revisions to certain interpretations of the Capital Rules underlying the RWA calculation based on regulatory feedback) and an increase in derivatives (principally due to increased exposures and the impact of SA-CCR adoption). Standardized Market RWAs as of December 2021 increased by $ 7.79 billion compared with December 2020, primarily reflecting an increase in stressed VaR (principally due to increased exposures to interest rates). 

Advanced Credit RWAs as of December 2021 increased by $ 25.79 billion compared with December 2020, primarily reflecting an increase in commitments, guarantees and loans (principally due to increased lending activity). This increase was partially offset by a decrease in equity investments (principally due to the sale of equity positions). Advanced Market RWAs as of December 2021 increased by $ 7.79 billion compared with December 2020, primarily reflecting an increase in stressed VaR (principally due to increased exposures to interest rates). Advanced Operational RWAs as of December 2021 increased by $ 4.60 billion compared with December 2020, primarily associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. 

Year Ended December 2020. 

Standardized Credit RWAs as of December 2020 decreased by $ 13.55 billion compared with December 2019, primarily reflecting a decrease in equity investments (principally due to the sale of certain equity positions) and a decrease in other (principally due to decreased receivables as a result of changes in risk measurements). These decreases were partially offset by an increase in securities financing transactions (principally due to increased funding exposures). Standardized Market RWAs as of December 2020 increased by $ 4.14 billion compared with December 2019, primarily reflecting an increase in regulatory VaR (principally due to increased market volatility) and an increase in incremental risk (principally due to increased exposures in equities held for market-making purposes). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in specific risk (principally due to changes in risk measurements on certain exposures). 

Advanced Credit RWAs as of December 2020 increased by $ 51.63 billion compared with December 2019, primarily reflecting an increase in derivatives (principally due to the impact of higher levels of volatility and counterparty credit risk) and an increase in commitments, guarantees and loans (principally due to increased lending activity). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in equity investments (principally due to the sale of certain equity positions). Advanced Market RWAs as of December 2020 increased by $ 4.34 billion compared with December 2019, primarily reflecting an increase in regulatory VaR (principally due to increased market volatility) and an increase in incremental risk (principally due to increased exposures in equities held for market-making purposes). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in specific risk (principally due to changes in risk measurements on certain exposures). Advanced Operational RWAs as of December 2020 increased by $ 9.13 billion compared with December 2019. The vast majority of this increase was associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings.

GS Bank USA.

GS Bank USA is the firm&#8217;s primary U.S. bank subsidiary. GS Bank USA is an FDIC-insured, New York State-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System, is supervised and regulated by the FRB, the FDIC, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and is subject to regulatory capital requirements that are calculated under the Capital Framework. On July 1, 2021, GS Bank USA acquired GSBE, a non-U.S.

banking subsidiary of the firm, which is also subject to standalone regulatory capital requirements noted below. GS Bank USA is an Advanced approach banking organization under the Capital Framework. 

The Capital Framework includes the minimum risk-based capital and the capital conservation buffer requirements (consisting of a 2.5 % buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer). The buffer must consist entirely of capital that qualifies as CET1 capital. In addition, the Capital Framework includes the leverage ratio requirement. 

GS Bank USA is required to calculate the CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios in accordance with both the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules. The lower of each risk-based capital ratio under the Standardized and Advanced Capital Rules is the ratio against which GS Bank USA&#8217;s compliance with its risk-based capital requirements is assessed. In addition, under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action applicable to GS Bank USA, in order to meet the quantitative requirements for a &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; depository institution, GS Bank USA must also meet the &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; requirements in the table below. GS Bank USA&#8217;s capital levels and prompt corrective action classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings and other factors. Failure to comply with the capital requirements, including a breach of the buffers described below, would result in restrictions being imposed by the regulators. 

The table below presents GS Bank USA&#8217;s risk-based capital, leverage and &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; requirements.

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; As permitted by the FRB, GS Bank USA elected to temporarily delay the estimated effects of adopting CECL on regulatory capital until January 2022 and to subsequently phase &#160;

in

the effects through January 2025. In addition, GS Bank USA elected to increase regulatory capital by 25 % of the increase in the allowance for credit losses since January 1, 2020, as permitted by the rules issued by the FRB. The impact of this increase will also be phased in over the three-year transition period. Reflecting the full impact of CECL as of both December 2021 and December 2020 would not have had a material impact on GS Bank USA&#8217;s Standardized risk-based capital ratios.

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; In connection with the regulatory feedback the firm received in the third quarter of 2021, GS Bank USA revised certain interpretations of the Capital Rules underlying the calculation of Standardized RWAs. As of December 2020, this change would have increased GS Bank USA&#8217;s Standardized RWAs of $ 281 billion by approximately $ 11 billion, which would have reduced GS Bank USA&#8217;s Standardized CET1 capital ratio of 12.3 % by 0.4 percentage points, Standardized Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.3 % by 0.4 percentage points and Standardized Total capital ratio of 14.6 % by 0.6 percentage points. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; In December 2021, GS Bank USA adopted SA-CCR ,

which resulted in an increase to GS Bank USA&#8217;s Standardized CET1 capital ratio by approximately 1.9 percentage points as of December 2021. 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; The Standardized risk-based capital ratios increased from December 2020 to December 2021, reflecting an increase in capital due to capital contributions and net earnings, partially offset by an increase in both Credit and Market RWAs. The increase in Standardized Credit RWAs reflected an increase in commitments, guarantees and loans (principally due to increased lending activity and revisions to certain interpretations of the Capital Rules underlying the RWA calculation based on regulatory feedback described above), partially offset by a decrease in derivatives (principally due to the impact of SA-CCR adoption described above). The increase in Standardized Market RWAs primarily reflected an increase in stressed VaR and regulatory VaR (in each case, principally due to increased exposures to interest rates). 

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; The Advanced risk-based capital ratios decreased from December 2020 to December 2021, reflecting an increase in both Credit and Market RWAs, partially offset by an increase in capital due to capital contributions and net earnings. The increase in Advanced Credit RWAs reflected an increase in commitments, guarantees and loans (principally due to increased lending activity) and the increase in Advanced Market RWAs primarily reflected an increase in stressed VaR and regulatory VaR (in each case, principally due to increased exposures to interest rates).

The deposits of GSBE are covered by the German statutory deposit protection program to the extent provided by law. In addition, GSBE has elected to participate in the German voluntary deposit protection program which provides insurance for certain eligible deposits not covered by the German statutory deposit program. GSBE is subject to minimum reserve requirements at central banks in certain of the jurisdictions in which it operates. The minimum reserve requirement was $ 189 million as of December 2021 and $ 25 million as of December 2020. The amount deposited by GSBE at central banks was $ 20.36 billion as of December 2021 and $ 3.17 billion as of December 2020, substantially all of which was deposited with Deutsche Bundesbank. 

GSBE is a registered swap dealer with the CFTC and, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, also became a registered security-based swap dealer with the SEC. As of December 2021, GSBE was subject to and in compliance with applicable capital requirements for swap dealers and security-based swap dealers. 

Restrictions on Payments 

Group Inc. may be limited in its ability to access capital held at certain subsidiaries as a result of regulatory, tax or other constraints. These limitations include provisions of applicable law and regulations and other regulatory restrictions that limit the ability of those subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends without prior regulatory approval. For example, the amount of dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test. As a result of dividends paid in connection with the acquisition of GSBE in July 2021, GS Bank USA cannot currently declare any additional dividends without prior regulatory approval. 

In addition, subsidiaries not subject to separate regulatory capital requirements may hold capital to satisfy local tax and legal guidelines, rating agency requirements (for entities with assigned credit ratings) or internal policies, including policies concerning the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based on its underlying level of risk. 

Group Inc.&#8217;s equity investment in subsidiaries was $ 118.90 billion as of December 2021 and $ 103.80 billion as of December 2020, of which Group Inc. was required to maintain $ 77.22 billion as of December 2021 and $ 63.68 billion as of December 2020, of minimum equity capital in its regulated subsidiaries in order to satisfy the regulatory requirements of such subsidiaries. 

Group Inc.&#8217;s capital invested in certain non-U.S.

dollar functional currency subsidiaries is exposed to foreign exchange risk, substantially all of which is managed through a combination of derivatives and non-U.S.

dollar-denominated

debt. See Note 7 for information about the firm&#8217;s net investment hedges used to hedge this risk.

Earnings Per Common Share 

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net earnings to common by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and restricted stock units (RSUs) for which the delivery of the underlying common stock is not subject to satisfaction of future service, performance or market conditions (collectively, basic shares). Diluted EPS includes the determinants of basic EPS and, in addition, reflects the dilutive effect of the common stock deliverable for RSUs for which the delivery of the underlying common stock is subject to satisfaction of future service, performance or market conditions.

Management fees waived were $ 595 million (of which $ 565 million related to voluntary waivers on money market funds) for 2021, $ 109 million for 2020 and $ 44 million for 2019. 

The Volcker Rule restricts the firm from providing financial support to covered funds (as defined in the rule) after the expiration of the conformance period. As a general matter, in the ordinary course of business, the firm does not expect to provide additional voluntary financial support to any covered funds, but may choose to do so with respect to funds that are not subject to the Volcker Rule. However, any such support is not expected to be material to the results of operations of the firm. 

In March 2020, GS Bank USA and unaffiliated entities purchased certificates of deposit and commercial paper from two money market funds managed by the firm. These funds are not covered funds under the Volcker Rule. GS Bank USA&#8217;s purchase price of these securities was $ 1.84 billion, of which none were outstanding as of December 2021 and $ 321 million were outstanding as of December 2020. These purchases were made to promote liquidity in the short-term credit markets and to increase the funds&#8217; weekly liquid assets. Group Inc. provided a guarantee to GS Bank USA in connection with these securities. See Note 18 for information about guarantees provided by Group Inc. to subsidiaries.

Deferred Income Taxes 

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. These temporary differences result in taxable or d e

ductible amounts in future years and are measured using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that more likely than not will be realized and primarily relate to the ability to utilize losses in various tax jurisdictions. Tax assets are included in other assets and tax liabilities are included in other liabilities. 

The table below presents information about deferred tax assets and liabilities, excluding the impact of netting within tax jurisdictions.

The firm has recorded deferred tax assets of $ 681 million as of December 2021 and $ 510 million as of December 2020, in connection with U.S. federal, state and local and foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The firm also recorded a valuation allowance of $ 285 million as of December 2021 and $ 79 million as of December 2020, related to these net operating loss carryforwards. 

As of December 2021, the U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward was $ 1.16 billion, the state and local net operating loss carryforward was $ 1.80 billion, and the foreign net operating loss carryforward was $ 1.31 billion. If not utilized, the U.S. federal, the state and local, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2022 . If these carryforwards expire, they will not have a material impact on the firm&#8217;s results of operations. As of December 2021, the firm has recorded deferred tax assets of $ 32 million in connection with general business credit carryforwards and $ 11 million in connection with state and local tax credit carryforwards. If not utilized, the general business credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2022 and the state and local tax credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2023 . As of December 2021, the firm did not have any foreign tax credit carryforwards. 

As of both December 2021 and December 2020, the firm had no U.S. capital loss carryforwards and no related net deferred income tax assets. As of December 2021, the firm had deferred tax assets of $ 270 million in connection with foreign capital loss carryforwards and a valuation allowance of $ 270 million related to these capital loss carryforwards. 

The valuation allowance increased by $ 344 million during 2021 and increased by $ 84 million during 2020. The increases in both 2021 and 2020 were primarily due to an increase in deferred tax assets from which the firm does not expect to realize any benefit. 

The firm permanently reinvested eligible earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. As of both December 2021 and December 2020, all U.S. taxes were accrued on these subsidiaries&#8217; distributable earnings.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits 

The firm recognizes tax positions in the consolidated financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized on settlement. A liability is established for differences between positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements. 

The accrued liability for interest expense related to income tax matters and income tax penalties was $ 131 million as of December 2021 and $ 129 million as of December 2020. The firm recognized interest expense and income tax penalties of $ 13 million for 2021, $ 41 million for 2020 and $ 60 million for 2019. It is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits could change significantly during the twelve months subsequent to December 2021 due to potential audit settlements. However, at this time it is not possible to estimate any potential change. 

The table below presents the changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which is included in other liabilities.

Regulatory Tax Examinations 

The firm is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing authorities in jurisdictions where the firm has significant business operations, such as the United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong and various states, such as New York. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. The firm does not expect completion of these audits to have a material impact on the firm&#8217;s financial condition, but it may be material to operating results for a particular period, depending, in part, on the operating results for that period. 

The table below presents the earliest tax years that remain subject to examination by major jurisdiction.

##TABLE_END The firm has been accepted into the Compliance Assurance Process program by the IRS for each of the tax years from 2013 through 2022. This program allows the firm to work with the IRS to identify and resolve potential U.S. Federal tax issues before the filing of tax returns. The fieldwork for tax years 2011 through 2018 has been completed and the final resolution is not expected to have a material impact on the effective tax rate. The 2019 and 2020 tax years remain subject to post-filing review. New York State and City examinations of 2015 through 2018 commenced during 2021. 

All years, including and subsequent to the years in the table above, remain open to examination by the taxing authorities. The firm believes that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits it has established is adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments.

Note 25. 

Business Segments 

&#160;

The firm reports its activities in four business segments: Investment Banking, Global Markets, Asset Management and Consumer &#38; Wealth Management. See Note 1 for information about the firm&#8217;s business segments. 

Compensation and benefits expenses in the firm&#8217;s segments reflect, among other factors, the overall performance of the firm, as well as the performance of individual businesses. Consequently, pre-tax

margins in one segment of the firm&#8217;s business may be significantly affected by the performance of the firm&#8217;s other business segments. 

The firm allocates assets (including allocations of global core liquid assets and cash, secured client financing and other assets), revenues and expenses among the four business segments. Due to the integrated nature of these segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses. The allocation process is based on the manner in which management currently views the performance of the segments. 

The allocation of common shareholders&#8217; equity and preferred stock dividends to each segment is based on the estimated amount of equity required to support the activities of the segment under relevant regulatory capital requirements. 

Net earnings for each segment is calculated by applying the firmwide tax rate to each segment&#8217;s pre-tax

earnings. 

Management believes that this allocation provides a reasonable representation of each segment&#8217;s contribution to consolidated net earnings to common, return on average common equity and total assets. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates. 

Segment Results 

The table below presents a summary of the firm&#8217;s segment results.

Geographic Information 

Due to the highly integrated nature of international financial markets, the firm manages its businesses based on the profitability of the enterprise as a whole. The methodology for allocating profitability to geographic regions is dependent on estimates and management judgment because a significant portion of the firm&#8217;s activities require cross-border coordination in order to facilitate the needs of the firm&#8217;s clients. Geographic results are generally allocated as follows: 

&#160;

##TABLE_END &#160;

##TABLE_START &#8226; &#160; Global Markets: FICC and Equities intermediation: location of the market-making desk; FICC and Equities financing (excluding prime brokerage financing): location of the desk; prime brokerage financing: location of the primary market for the underlying security.

Note 26. 

Credit Concentrations 

The firm&#8217;s concentrations of credit risk arise from its market making, client facilitation, investing, underwriting, lending and collateralized transactions, and cash management activities, and may be impacted by changes in economic, industry or political factors. These activities expose the firm to many different industries and counterparties, and may also subject the firm to a concentration of credit risk to a particular central bank, counterparty, borrower or issuer, including sovereign issuers, or to a particular clearing house or exchange. The firm seeks to mitigate credit risk by actively monitoring exposures and obtaining collateral from counterparties as deemed appropriate. 

The firm measures and monitors its credit exposure based on amounts owed to the firm after taking into account risk mitigants that the firm considers when determining credit risk. Such risk mitigants include netting and collateral arrangements and economic hedges, such as credit derivatives, futures and forward contracts. Netting and collateral agreements permit the firm to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties and/or enable the firm to obtain collateral on an upfront or contingent basis. 

The table below presents the credit concentrations included in trading cash instruments and investments.

Legal Proceedings 

The firm is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings (including those described below) concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of the firm&#8217;s businesses. Many of these proceedings are in early stages, and many of these cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages. 

Under ASC 450, an event is &#8220;reasonably possible&#8221; if &#8220;the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely&#8221; and an event is &#8220;remote&#8221; if &#8220;the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.&#8221; Thus, references to the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss for cases in which the firm is able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss mean the upper end of the range of loss for cases for which the firm believes the risk of loss is more than slight. 

With respect to matters described below for which management has been able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss where (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have claimed an amount of money damages, (ii) the firm is being, or threatened to be, sued by purchasers in a securities offering and is not being indemnified by a party that the firm believes will pay the full amount of any judgment, or (iii) the purchasers are demanding that the firm repurchase securities, management has estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss based on (a) in the case of (i), the amount of money damages claimed, (b) in the case of (ii), the difference between the initial sales price of the securities that the firm sold in such offering and the estimated lowest subsequent price of such securities prior to the action being commenced and (c) in the case of (iii), the price that purchasers paid for the securities less the estimated value, if any, as of December 2021 of the relevant securities, in each of cases (i), (ii) and (iii), taking into account any other factors believed to be relevant to the particular matter or matters of that type. As of the date hereof, the firm has estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss for such matters and for any other matters described below where management has been able to estimate a range of reasonably possible aggregate loss to be approximately $ 2.0 billion in excess of the aggregate reserves for such matters. 

Management is generally unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for matters other than those included in the estimate above, including where (i) actual or potential plaintiffs have not claimed an amount of money damages, except in those instances where management can otherwise determine an appropriate amount, (ii) matters are in early stages, (iii) matters relate to regulatory investigations or reviews, except in those instances where management can otherwise determine an appropriate amount, (iv) there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (v) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, (vi) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, and/or (vii) there are novel legal issues presented. For example, the firm&#8217;s potential liabilities with respect to the investigations and reviews described below in &#8220;Regulatory Investigations and Reviews and Related Litigation&#8221; generally are not included in management&#8217;s estimate of reasonably possible loss. However, management does not believe, based on currently available information, that the outcomes of such other matters will have a material adverse effect on the firm&#8217;s financial condition, though the outcomes could be material to the firm&#8217;s operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period.

1MDB-Related Matters 

Between 2012 and 2013, subsidiaries of the firm acted as arrangers or purchasers of approximately $ 6.5 billion of debt securities of 1MDB. 

On November 1, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed a criminal information and guilty plea by Tim Leissner, a former participating managing director of the firm, and an indictment against Ng Chong Hwa, a former managing director of the firm. On August 28, 2018, Leissner was adjudicated guilty by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York of conspiring to launder money and to violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act&#8217;s (FCPA) anti-bribery and internal accounting controls provisions. Ng was charged with conspiring to launder money and to violate the FCPA&#8217;s anti-bribery and internal accounting controls provisions. On May 6, 2019, Ng pleaded not guilty to the DOJ&#8217;s criminal charges, and trial commenced on February 7, 2022. 

On August 18, 2020, the firm announced that it entered into a settlement agreement with the Government of Malaysia to resolve the criminal and regulatory proceedings in Malaysia involving the firm, which includes a guarantee that the Government of Malaysia receives at least $ 1.4 billion in assets and proceeds from assets seized by governmental authorities around the world related to 1MDB. See Note 18 for further information about this guarantee. 

On October 22, 2020, the firm announced that it reached settlements of governmental and regulatory investigations relating to 1MDB with the DOJ, the SEC, the FRB, the NYDFS, the FCA, the PRA, the Singapore Attorney General&#8217;s Chambers, the Singapore Commercial Affairs Department, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission. Group Inc. entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ, in which a charge against the firm, one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, was filed and will later be dismissed if the firm abides by the terms of the agreement. In addition, GS Malaysia pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, and was sentenced on June 9, 2021. In May 2021, the U.S. Department of Labor granted the firm a five-year exemption to maintain its status as a qualified professional asset manager (QPAM). 

The firm has received multiple demands, beginning in November 2018, from alleged shareholders under Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law for books and records relating to, among other things, the firm&#8217;s involvement with 1MDB and the firm&#8217;s compliance procedures. On December 13, 2019, an alleged shareholder filed a lawsuit in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware seeking books and records relating to, among other things, the firm&#8217;s involvement with 1MDB and the firm&#8217;s compliance procedures. The lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice on August 4, 2021. 

On February 19, 2019, a purported shareholder derivative action relating to 1MDB was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Group Inc. and the directors at the time and a former chairman and chief executive officer of the firm. The second amended complaint filed on November 13, 2020, alleges breaches of fiduciary duties, including in connection with alleged insider trading by certain current and former directors, unjust enrichment and violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act, including in connection with Group Inc.&#8217;s common stock repurchases and solicitation of proxies, and seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement and injunctive relief. Defendants moved to dismiss this action on January 15, 2021. On February 3, 2022, the parties reached a settlement in principle, subject to final documentation and court approval, to resolve this action. 

Beginning in March 2019, the firm has also received demands from three shareholders to investigate and pursue claims against certain current and former directors and executive officers based on their oversight and public disclosures regarding 1MDB and related internal controls. In June 2019, the Board appointed a Special Committee to consider the demands and, in January 2021, the Board voted to reject them. In June 2021, the firm reached a settlement with the three shareholders. Following the Board&#8217;s decision to reject the initial three demands, the firm received two additional demands from alleged shareholders (one of which is the alleged shareholder that filed the December 2019 books and records action in Delaware Chancery Court) to investigate and pursue claims related to 1MDB (and, for one of the demands, other matters) against other parties, including certain current and former directors and executive officers of the firm. In December 2021, the Board voted to reject the two additional demands.

On December 20, 2018, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Group Inc. and certain former officers of the firm alleging violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act with respect to Group Inc.&#8217;s disclosures and public statements concerning 1MDB and seeking unspecified damages. The plaintiffs filed the second amended complaint on October 28, 2019. On June 28, 2021, the court dismissed the claims against one of the individual defendants but denied the defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss with respect to the firm and the remaining individual defendants. On November 12, 2021, the plaintiffs moved for class certification. 

Mortgage-Related Matters 

Beginning in April 2010, a number of purported securities law class actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York challenging the adequacy of Group Inc.&#8217;s public disclosure of, among other things, the firm&#8217;s activities in the collateralized debt obligation market, and the firm&#8217;s conflict of interest management. 

The consolidated amended complaint filed on July 25, 2011, which named as defendants Group Inc. and certain current and former officers and employees of Group Inc. and its affiliates, generally alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and seeks monetary damages. The defendants have moved for summary judgment. On April 7, 2020, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court&#8217;s August 14, 2018 grant of class certification. On June 21, 2021, the United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment of the Second Circuit and remanded the case for further proceedings, and on August 26, 2021, the Second Circuit vacated the district court&#8217;s grant of class certification and remanded the case for further proceedings. On December 8, 2021, the district court granted the plaintiffs&#8217; motion for class certification. On December 22, 2021, defendants filed a petition with the Second Circuit seeking interlocutory review of the district court&#8217;s grant of class certification. 

Complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on July 25, 2019 and May 29, 2020 against Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company and GS Mortgage Securities Corp. by U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee for two residential mortgage-backed securitization trusts that issued $ 1.7 billion of securities. The complaints generally allege that mortgage loans in the trusts failed to conform to applicable representations and warranties and seek specific performance or, alternatively, compensatory damages and other relief. On November 23, 2020, the court granted in part and denied in part defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss the complaint in the first action and denied defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss the complaint in the second action. On January 14, 2021, amended complaints were filed in both actions.

The third amended complaint in the U.S. district court action, filed on August 3, 2020, generally alleges that the defendants violated federal antitrust law and state common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to manipulate the foreign currency exchange markets and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as unspecified amounts of compensatory, punitive, treble and other damages. The claim in the English action is for breaches of English and E.U. competition rules from 2003 to 2013 and alleges manipulation of foreign exchange rates and bid/offer spreads, the exchange of commercially sensitive information among defendants and collusive trading. 

GS&#38;Co. is among the defendants named in a putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on August 4, 2021.

Banco Espirito Santo S.A. and Oak Finance 

Beginning in February 2015, GSI commenced actions against Novo Banco S.A. (Novo Banco) in the English Commercial Court and the Bank of Portugal (BoP) in Portuguese Administrative Court in response to BoP&#8217;s decisions in December 2014, September 2015 and December 2015 to reverse an earlier transfer to Novo Banco of an $ 835 million facility agreement (the Facility), structured by GSI, between Oak Finance Luxembourg S.A. (Oak Finance), a special purpose vehicle formed in connection with the Facility, and Banco Espirito Santo S.A. (BES) prior to the failure of BES. In July 2018, the English Supreme Court found that the English courts did not yet have jurisdiction over GSI&#8217;s action. In July 2018, the Liquidation Committee for BES issued a decision seeking to claw back from GSI $ 54 million paid to GSI and $ 50 million paid to Oak Finance in connection with the Facility, alleging that GSI acted in bad faith in extending the Facility, including because GSI allegedly knew that BES was at risk of imminent failure. In October 2018, GSI commenced an action in Lisbon Commercial Court challenging the Liquidation Committee&#8217;s decision and has since also issued a claim against the Portuguese State seeking compensation for losses of approximately $ 222 million related to the failure of BES, together with a contingent claim for the $ 104 million sought by the Liquidation Committee. 

Financial Advisory Services 

Group Inc. and certain of its affiliates are from time to time parties to various civil litigation and arbitration proceedings and other disputes with clients and third parties relating to the firm&#8217;s financial advisory activities.

plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and, on December 22, 2021, the 

defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint. On January 4, 2022, the plaintiffs moved for class certification. 

Group Inc. is also a defendant in putative securities class actions filed beginning in October 2021 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.

(Gaotu), Tencent Music Entertainment Group (Tencent), ViacomCBS, iQIYI Inc. (iQIYI) and Baidu Inc.

In these proceedings, including those described below, the plaintiffs assert class action or individual claims under federal and state securities laws and in some cases other applicable laws, allege that the offering documents for the securities that they purchased contained material misstatements and omissions, and generally seek compensatory and rescissory damages in unspecified amounts, as well as rescission. Certain of these proceedings involve additional allegations.

Interest Rate Swap Antitrust Litigation 

Group Inc., GS&#38;Co., GSI, GS Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Financial Markets, L.P. are among the defendants named in a putative antitrust class action relating to the trading of interest rate swaps, filed in November 2015 and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The same Goldman Sachs entities are 

also among the defendants named in two antitrust actions relating to the trading of interest rate swaps, commenced in April 2016 and June 2018, respectively, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by three operators of swap execution facilities and certain of their affiliates. These actions have been consolidated for pretrial proceedings. The complaints generally assert claims under federal antitrust law and state common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy among the defendants to preclude exchange trading of interest rate swaps. The complaints in the individual actions also assert claims under state antitrust law. The complaints seek declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as treble damages in an unspecified amount. Defendants moved to dismiss the class and the first individual action and the district court dismissed the state common law claims asserted by the plaintiffs in the first individual action and otherwise limited the state common law claim in the putative class action and the antitrust claims in both actions to the period from 2013 to 2016. On November 20, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss the second individual action, dismissing the state common law claims for unjust enrichment and tortious interference, but denying dismissal of the federal and state antitrust claims. On March 13, 2019, the court denied the plaintiffs&#8217; motion in the putative class action to amend their complaint to add allegations related to conduct from

2008 &#160;

to 

2012, but granted the motion to add limited allegations from 2013 &#160;

to 

2016, which the plaintiffs added in a fourth consolidated amended complaint filed on March 22, 2019. The plaintiffs in the putative class action moved for class certification on March 7, 2019. 

Commodities-Related Litigation 

GSI is among the defendants named in putative class actions relating to trading in platinum and palladium, filed beginning on November 25, 2014 and most recently amended on May 15, 2017, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The amended complaint generally alleges that the defendants violated federal antitrust laws and the Commodity Exchange Act in connection with an alleged conspiracy to manipulate a benchmark for physical platinum and palladium prices and seek declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as treble damages in an unspecified amount. On March 29, 2020, the court granted the defendants&#8217; motions to dismiss and for reconsideration, resulting in the dismissal of all claims. On April 27, 2020, plaintiffs appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. 

GS&#38;Co., GSI, J. Aron &#38; Company and Metro International Trade Services (Metro), a previously consolidated subsidiary of Group Inc. that was sold in the fourth quarter of 2014, are among the defendants in a number of putative class and individual actions filed beginning on August 1, 2013 and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaints generally allege violations of federal antitrust laws and state laws in connection with the storage of aluminum and aluminum trading. The complaints seek declaratory, injunctive and other equitable relief, as well as unspecified monetary damages, including treble damages. In December 2016, the district court granted defendants&#8217; motions to dismiss and on August 27, 2019, the Second Circuit vacated the district court&#8217;s dismissals and remanded the case to district court for further proceedings. On July 23, 2020, the district court denied the class plaintiffs&#8217; motion for class certification, and on December 16, 2020 the Second Circuit denied leave to appeal the denial. On February 17, 2021, the district court granted defendants&#8217; motion for summary judgment with respect to the claims of most of the individual plaintiffs. On April 14, 2021, the plaintiffs appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. 

In connection with the sale of Metro, the firm agreed to provide indemnities to the buyer, including for any potential liabilities for legal or regulatory proceedings arising out of the conduct of Metro&#8217;s business while the firm owned it. 

U.S. Treasury Securities Litigation 

GS&#38;Co. is among the primary dealers named as defendants in several putative class actions relating to the market for U.S. Treasury securities, filed beginning in July 2015 and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. GS&#38;Co. is also among the primary dealers named as defendants in a similar individual action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on August 25, 2017. The consolidated class action complaint, filed on December 29, 2017, generally alleges that the defendants violated antitrust laws in connection with an alleged conspiracy to manipulate the when-issued market and auctions for U.S. Treasury securities and that certain defendants, including GS&#38;Co., colluded to preclude trading of U.S. Treasury securities on electronic trading platforms in order to impede competition in the bidding process. The individual action alleges a similar conspiracy regarding manipulation of the when-issued market and auctions, as well as related futures and options in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. The complaints seek declaratory and injunctive relief, treble damages in an unspecified amount and restitution. Defendants&#8217; motion to dismiss was granted on March 31, 2021. On May 14, 2021, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On June 14, 2021, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.

On September 15, 2010, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by three female former employees. The complaint, as subsequently amended, alleges that Group Inc. and GS&#38;Co. have systematically discriminated against female employees in respect of compensation, promotion and performance evaluations.

The complaint seeks class action status, injunctive relief and unspecified amounts of compensatory, punitive and other damages. 

On March 30, 2018, the district court certified a damages class as to the plaintiffs&#8217; disparate impact and treatment claims. On September 4, 2018, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals denied defendants&#8217; petition for interlocutory review of the district court&#8217;s class certification decision and subsequently denied defendants&#8217; petition for rehearing. On September 27, 2018, plaintiffs advised the district court that they would not seek to certify a class for injunctive and declaratory relief. On March 26, 2020, the Magistrate Judge in the district court granted in part a motion to compel arbitration as to class members who are parties to certain agreements with Group Inc. and/or GS&#38;Co. in which they agreed to arbitrate employment-related disputes. On April 16, 2020, plaintiffs submitted objections to the Magistrate Judge&#8217;s order and defendants submitted conditional objections in the event that the district judge overturned any portion of the Magistrate Judge&#8217;s order. On July 22, 2021, defendants filed a motion to decertify the class. On August 9, 2021, plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment as to a portion of a disparate impact claim, and defendants filed a motion for summary judgment as to plaintiff&#8217;s disparate impact and treatment claims.

Employee Benefit Plans 

The firm sponsors various pension plans and certain other postretirement benefit plans, primarily healthcare and life insurance. The firm also provides certain benefits to former or inactive employees prior to retirement. 

Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Postretirement Plans 

Employees of certain non-U.S.

subsidiaries participate in various defined benefit pension plans. These plans generally provide benefits based on years of credited service and a percentage of eligible compensation. The firm maintains a defined benefit pension plan for certain U.K. employees. As of April 2008, the U.K. defined benefit plan was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants as of March 31, 2016. The non-U.S.

plans do not have a material impact on the firm&#8217;s consolidated results of operations. 

The firm also maintains a defined benefit pension plan for substantially all U.S. employees hired prior to November 1, 2003. As of November 2004, this plan was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants. In addition, the firm maintains unfunded postretirement benefit plans that provide medical and life insurance for eligible retirees and their dependents covered under these programs. These plans do not have a material impact on the firm&#8217;s consolidated results of operations. 

The firm recognizes the funded status of its defined benefit pension and postretirement plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation, in the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 2021, other assets included $ 411 million (related to overfunded pension plans) and other liabilities included $ 426 million related to these plans. As of December 2020, other assets included $ 343 million (related to overfunded pension plans) and other liabilities included $ 478 million related to these plans. 

Defined Contribution Plans 

The firm contributes to employer-sponsored U.S. and non-U.S.

defined contribution plans. The firm&#8217;s contribution to these plans was $ 274 million for 2021, $ 261 million for 2020 and $ 254 million for 2019.

Employee Incentive Plans 

&#160;

The cost of employee services received in exchange for a share-based award is generally measured based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Share-based awards that do not require future service (i.e., vested awards, including awards granted to retirement-eligible employees) are expensed immediately. Share-based awards that require future service are amortized over the relevant service period. Forfeitures are recorded when they occur. 

Cash dividend equivalents paid on RSUs are generally charged to retained earnings. If RSUs that require future service are forfeited, the related dividend equivalents originally charged to retained earnings are reclassified to compensation expense in the period in which forfeiture occurs. 

The firm generally issues new shares of common stock upon delivery of share-based awards. In certain cases, primarily related to conflicted employment (as outlined in the applicable award agreements), the firm may cash settle share-based compensation awards accounted for as equity instruments. For these awards, whose terms allow for cash settlement, additional paid-in

capital is adjusted to the extent of the difference between the value of the award at the time of cash settlement and the grant-date value of the award. 

Stock Incentive Plan 

The firm sponsors a stock incentive plan, The Goldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (2021) (2021 SIP), which provides for grants of RSUs, restricted stock, dividend equivalent rights, incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other share-based awards, each of which may be subject to terms and conditions, including performance or market conditions. On April 29, 2021, shareholders approved the 2021 SIP. The 2021 SIP is a successor to several predecessor stock incentive plans, the first of which was adopted on April 30, 1999, and each of which was approved by the firm&#8217;s shareholders. 

As of December 2021, 69.8 million shares were available to be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2021 SIP. If any shares of common stock underlying awards granted under the 2021 SIP or awards granted under the 2018, 2015 or 2013 predecessor stock incentive plans are not delivered because such awards are forfeited, terminated or canceled, or if shares of common stock underlying such awards are surrendered or withheld to satisfy any obligation of the grantee (including taxes), those shares will become available to be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the 2021 SIP. Shares available to be delivered under the 2021 SIP also are subject to adjustment for certain events or changes in corporate structure as provided under the 2021 SIP. The 2021 SIP is scheduled to terminate on the date of the annual meeting of shareholders that occurs in 2025. 

Restricted Stock Units 

The firm grants RSUs (including RSUs subject to performance or market conditions) to employees, which are generally valued based on the closing price of the underlying shares on the date of grant after taking into account a liquidity discount for any applicable post-vesting and delivery transfer restrictions. The value of equity awards also considers the impact of material non-public information, if any, that the firm expects to make available shortly following grant. RSUs generally vest and underlying shares of common stock deliver (net of required withholding tax) as outlined in the applicable award agreements. Award agreements generally provide that vesting is accelerated in certain circumstances, such as on retirement, death, disability and, in certain cases, conflicted employment. Delivery of the underlying shares of common stock is conditioned on the grantees satisfying certain vesting and other requirements outlined in the award agreements. RSUs not subject to performance conditions generally vest and

deliver over a three-year period. 

RSUs that are subject to performance or market conditions generally deliver after the end of a three to five year period. For awards that are subject to performance or market conditions, generally the final award is adjusted from

zero up to 150 % of the original grant based on satisfaction of those conditions. Dividend equivalents that accrue on these awards are paid when the awards settle.

Generally, shares underlying these RSUs, net of required withholding tax, deliver over a three-year period, but are subject to a one-year post-vesting and delivery transfer restriction.
