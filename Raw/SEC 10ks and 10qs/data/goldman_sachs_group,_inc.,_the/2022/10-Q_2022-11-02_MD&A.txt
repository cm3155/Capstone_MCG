Executive Overview 

Three Months Ended September 2022 versus September 2021. We generated net earnings of $3.07 billion for the third quarter of 2022, compared with $5.38 billion for the third quarter of 2021. Diluted earnings per common share (EPS) was $8.25 for the third quarter of 2022 compared with $14.93 for the third quarter of 2021. Annualized return on average common shareholders&#8217; equity (ROE) was 11.0% for the third quarter of 2022, compared with 22.5% for the third quarter of 2021. Book value per common share was $308.22 as of September 2022, 2.1% higher compared with June 2022 and 8.4% higher compared with December 2021. 

Net revenues were $11.98 billion for the third quarter of 2022, 12% lower than a strong third quarter of 2021, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in Investment Banking and Asset Management, partially offset by higher net revenues in Global Markets and Consumer &#38; Wealth Management. Net revenues in Investment Banking primarily reflected significantly lower net revenues in Underwriting and Financial advisory compared with a strong prior year period, and net revenues in Asset Management primarily reflected significantly lower net revenues in Equity investments and Lending and debt investments, partially offset by higher Management and other fees. Net revenues in Global Markets reflected significantly higher net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC), partially offset by lower net revenues in Equities compared with a strong prior year period, and net revenues in Consumer &#38; Wealth Management reflected growth in Consumer banking net revenues. 

Provision for credit losses was $515 million for the third quarter of 2022, compared with $175 million for the third quarter of 2021. Provisions for the third quarter of 2022 primarily reflected consumer portfolio growth, net charge-offs and the continued impact of broad macroeconomic concerns. The third quarter of 2021 primarily reflected provisions related to portfolio growth (primarily in credit cards).

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Operating expenses were $7.70 billion for the third quarter of 2022, 17% higher than the third quarter of 2021, reflecting significantly higher non-compensation expenses and higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting a smaller reduction in the year-to-date ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues, net of provision for credit losses, compared with the prior year period). Our efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided by total net revenues) for the third quarter of 2022 was 64.3%, compared with 48.4% for the third quarter of 2021. 

During the third quarter of 2022, we returned $1.89 billion of capital to common shareholders, including $1.00 billion of common share repurchases and $893 million of common stock dividends. As of September 2022, our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio was 14.3% under the Standardized Capital Rules and 14.6% under the Advanced Capital Rules. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our capital ratios. 

Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2022, consistent with our announced organizational changes that will become effective in December 2022, we will make certain changes to our business segments and report our results in the following three business segments: Global Banking &#38; Markets, Asset &#38; Wealth Management and Platform Solutions. 

Nine Months Ended September 2022 versus September 2021. We generated net earnings of $9.94 billion for the first nine months of 2022, compared with $17.70 billion for the first nine months of 2021. Diluted EPS was $26.71 for the first nine months of 2022, compared with $48.59 for the first nine months of 2021. Annualized ROE was 12.2% for the first nine months of 2022, compared with 25.7% for the first nine months of 2021. 

Net revenues were $36.77 billion for the first nine months of 2022, 21% lower than a strong first nine months of 2021, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in Asset Management and Investment Banking, partially offset by higher net revenues in Global Markets and significantly higher net revenues in Consumer &#38; Wealth Management. Broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns led to volatility in global equity prices and wider credit spreads, contributing to significantly lower net revenues in Equity investments and Lending and debt investments within Asset Management and significantly lower net revenues in Underwriting within Investment Banking. Net revenues in Global Markets reflected significantly higher net revenues in FICC, partially offset by lower net revenues in Equities compared with a strong prior year period, and net revenues in Consumer &#38; Wealth Management reflected growth in both Consumer banking and Wealth management net revenues. 

Provision for credit losses was $1.74 billion for the first nine months of 2022, compared with $13 million in the first nine months of 2021. Provisions in the first nine months of 2022 primarily reflected consumer portfolio growth (primarily in credit cards) and the impact of broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns. The first nine months of 2021 reflected portfolio growth, largely offset by reserve reductions as the broad economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. 

Operating expenses were $23.07 billion for the first nine months of 2022, 6% lower than the first nine months of 2021, reflecting significantly lower compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting a decline in operating performance compared with a strong prior year period), partially offset by higher non-compensation expenses. Our efficiency ratio for the first nine months of 2022 was 62.7%, compared with 52.8% for the first nine months of 2021. 

During the first nine months of 2022, we returned $4.32 billion of capital to common shareholders, including $2.00 billion of common share repurchases and $2.32 billion of common stock dividends. 

Business Environment 

During the third quarter of 2022, the continuation of broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, including inflationary pressures and the prolonged war in Ukraine, and uncertainty about the outlook, weighed on economic activity and kept market volatility high. In response, global central banks have generally continued to tighten monetary policy with additional policy interest rate increases during the quarter. These factors contributed to a decrease in global equity prices compared with the end of the second quarter of 2022. 

The economic outlook remains uncertain, reflecting concerns about the continuation or escalation of the war between Russia and Ukraine and other geopolitical risks, inflation, and supply chain complications. See &#8220;Results of Operations &#8212; Segment Assets and Operating Results &#8212; Segment Operating Results&#8221; for further information about the operating environment for each of our business segments.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Fair Value 

Fair Value Hierarchy. Trading assets and liabilities, certain investments and loans, and certain other financial assets and liabilities, are included in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value (i.e., marked-to-market), with related gains or losses generally recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings. The use of fair value to measure financial instruments is fundamental to our risk management practices and is our most critical accounting policy. 

The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We measure certain financial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks). In determining fair value, the hierarchy under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) gives (i) the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities (level 1 inputs), (ii) the next priority to inputs other than level 1 inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly (level 2 inputs), and (iii) the lowest priority to inputs that cannot be observed in market activity (level 3 inputs). In evaluating the significance of a valuation input, we consider, among other factors, a portfolio&#8217;s net risk exposure to that input. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement. 

The fair values for substantially all of our financial assets and liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets and liabilities may require appropriate valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors, such as counterparty and our credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads. 

Instruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are those which require one or more significant inputs that are not observable. Level 3 financial assets represented 1.9% as of September 2022, 1.8% as of June 2022 and 1.6% as of December 2021 of our total assets. See Notes 4 through 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about level 3 financial assets, including changes in level 3 financial assets and related fair value measurements. Absent evidence to the contrary, instruments classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequent to the transaction date, we use other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Estimating the fair value of level 3 financial instruments requires judgments to be made. These judgments include: 

&#8226; Determining the appropriate valuation methodology and/or model for each type of level 3 financial instrument; 

&#8226; Determining model inputs based on an evaluation of all relevant empirical market data, including prices evidenced by market transactions, interest rates, credit spreads, volatilities and correlations; and 

&#8226; Determining appropriate valuation adjustments, including those related to illiquidity or counterparty credit quality. 

Regardless of the methodology, valuation inputs and assumptions are only changed when corroborated by substantive evidence. 

Controls Over Valuation of Financial Instruments. Market makers and investment professionals in our revenue-producing units are responsible for pricing our financial instruments. Our control infrastructure is independent of the revenue-producing units and is fundamental to ensuring that all of our financial instruments are appropriately valued at market-clearing levels. In the event that there is a difference of opinion in situations where estimating the fair value of financial instruments requires judgment (e.g., calibration to market comparables or trade comparison, as described below), the final valuation decision is made by senior managers in independent risk oversight and control functions. This independent price verification is critical to ensuring that our financial instruments are properly valued.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Price Verification. All financial instruments at fair value classified in levels 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy are subject to our independent price verification process. The objective of price verification is to have an informed and independent opinion with regard to the valuation of financial instruments under review. Instruments that have one or more significant inputs which cannot be corroborated by external market data are classified in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Price verification strategies utilized by our independent risk oversight and control functions include: 

&#8226; Trade Comparison. Analysis of trade data (both internal and external, where available) is used to determine the most relevant pricing inputs and valuations. 

&#8226; External Price Comparison. Valuations and prices are compared to pricing data obtained from third parties (e.g., brokers or dealers, IHS Markit, Bloomberg, IDC, TRACE). Data obtained from various sources is compared to ensure consistency and validity. When broker or dealer quotations or third-party pricing vendors are used for valuation or price verification, greater priority is generally given to executable quotations. 

&#8226; Calibration to Market Comparables. Market-based transactions are used to corroborate the valuation of positions with similar characteristics, risks and components. 

&#8226; Relative Value Analyses. Market-based transactions are analyzed to determine the similarity, measured in terms of risk, liquidity and return, of one instrument relative to another or, for a given instrument, of one maturity relative to another. 

&#8226; Collateral Analyses. Margin calls on derivatives are analyzed to determine implied values, which are used to corroborate our valuations. 

&#8226; Execution of Trades. Where appropriate, market-making desks are instructed to execute trades in order to provide evidence of market-clearing levels. 

&#8226; Backtesting. Valuations are corroborated by comparison to values realized upon sales. 

See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about fair value measurements. 

Review of Net Revenues. Independent risk oversight and control functions ensure adherence to our pricing policy through a combination of daily procedures, including the explanation and attribution of net revenues based on the underlying factors. Through this process, we independently validate net revenues, identify and resolve potential fair value or trade booking issues on a timely basis and seek to ensure that risks are being properly categorized and quantified. 

Review of Valuation Models. Our independent model risk management group (Model Risk), consisting of quantitative professionals who are separate from model developers, performs an independent model review and validation process of our valuation models. New or changed models are reviewed and approved prior to implementation. Models are reviewed annually to assess the impact of any changes in the product or market and any market developments in pricing theories. See &#8220;Risk Management &#8212; Model Risk Management&#8221; for further information about the review and validation of our valuation models. 

Allowance for Credit Losses 

We estimate and record an allowance for credit losses related to our loans held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. To determine the allowance for credit losses, we classify our loans accounted for at amortized cost into wholesale and consumer portfolios. These portfolios represent the level at which we have developed and documented our methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and on an asset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. 

The allowance for credit losses takes into account the weighted average of a range of forecasts of future economic conditions over the expected life of the loans and lending commitments. The expected life of each loan or lending commitment is determined based on the contractual term adjusted for extension options or demand features, or is modeled in the case of revolving credit card loans. The forecasts include baseline, favorable and adverse economic scenarios over a three-year period. For loans with expected lives beyond three years, the model reverts to historical loss information based on a non-linear modeled approach. We apply judgment in weighting individual scenarios each quarter based on a variety of factors, including our internally derived economic outlook, market consensus, recent macroeconomic conditions and industry trends. The forecasted economic scenarios consider a number of risk factors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios. Risk factors for wholesale loans include internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators (e.g., unemployment rates and GDP), the borrower&#8217;s capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower&#8217;s country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. In addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio and home price index. Risk factors for installment and credit card loans include Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores, delinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic indicators.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

The allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative components which allow management to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk. 

Our estimate of credit losses entails judgment about collectability at the reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. The allowance for credit losses is subject to a governance process that involves review and approval by senior management within our independent risk oversight and control functions. Personnel within our independent risk oversight and control functions are responsible for forecasting the economic variables that underlie the economic scenarios that are used in the modeling of expected credit losses. While we use the best information available to determine this estimate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, among other things, changes in the economic environment or variances between actual results and the original assumptions used. Loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when deemed to be uncollectible. 

We also record an allowance for credit losses on lending commitments which are held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. Such allowance is determined using the same methodology as the allowance for loan losses, while also taking into consideration the probability of drawdowns or funding, and whether such commitments are cancellable by us. 

To estimate the potential impact of an adverse macroeconomic environment on our allowance for credit losses, we, among other things, compared the expected credit losses under the weighted average forecast used in the calculation of allowance for credit losses as of September 2022 (which was weighted towards the baseline and adverse economic scenarios) to the expected credit losses under a 100% weighted adverse economic scenario. The adverse economic scenario of the forecast model reflects a global recession in the fourth quarter of 2022 through the second half of 2023 resulting in an economic contraction, decline in consumer spending and rising unemployment rates. A 100% weighting to the adverse economic scenario would have resulted in an approximate $1.0 billion increase in our allowance for credit losses as of September 2022. This hypothetical increase does not take into consideration any potential adjustments to qualitative reserves. The forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain and do not take into account any other offsetting or correlated effects. The actual credit loss in an adverse macroeconomic environment may differ significantly from this estimate. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the allowance for credit losses. 

Use of Estimates 

U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. In addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost, the use of estimates and assumptions is also important in determining discretionary compensation accruals, the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and accounting for income taxes. 

A substantial portion of our compensation and benefits represents discretionary compensation, which is finalized at year-end. We believe the most appropriate way to allocate estimated year-end discretionary compensation among interim periods is in proportion to the net revenues net of provision for credit losses earned in such periods. In addition to the level of net revenues net of provision for credit losses, our overall compensation expense in any given year is also influenced by, among other factors, overall financial performance, prevailing labor markets, business mix, the structure of our share-based compensation programs and the external environment. 

Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its estimated carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative assessment. Estimating the fair value of our reporting units requires judgment. Critical inputs to the fair value estimates include projected earnings and allocated equity. There is inherent uncertainty in the projected earnings. The estimated carrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders&#8217; equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders&#8217; equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about goodwill. If we experience a prolonged or severe period of weakness in the business environment, financial markets, our performance or our common stock price, or additional increases in capital requirements, our goodwill could be impaired in the future.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Identifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset&#8217;s or asset group&#8217;s carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Judgment is required to evaluate whether indications of potential impairment have occurred, and to test identifiable intangible assets for impairment, if required. An impairment is recognized if the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about identifiable intangible assets. 

We also estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss in excess of the related reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings where we believe the risk of loss is more than slight. See Notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements for information about certain judicial, litigation and regulatory proceedings. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. Our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, proceeding or investigation, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases, proceedings or investigations, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. 

In accounting for income taxes, we recognize tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. We use estimates to recognize current and deferred income taxes in the U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate. The income tax laws in these jurisdictions are complex and can be subject to different interpretations between taxpayers and taxing authorities. Disputes may arise over these interpretations and can be settled by audit, administrative appeals or judicial proceedings. Our interpretations are reevaluated quarterly based on guidance currently available, tax examination experience and the opinions of legal counsel, among other factors. We recognize deferred taxes based on the amount that will more likely than not be realized in the future based on enacted income tax laws. Our estimate for deferred taxes includes estimates for future taxable earnings, including the level and character of those earnings, and various tax planning strategies. See Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K for further information about income taxes.

Results of Operations 

The composition of our net revenues has varied over time as financial markets and the scope of our operations have changed. The composition of net revenues can also vary over the shorter term due to fluctuations in U.S. and global economic and market conditions. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K for further information about the impact of economic and market conditions on our results of operations.

In the table above: 

&#8226; Net earnings to common represents net earnings applicable to common shareholders, which is calculated as net earnings less preferred stock dividends. 

&#8226; ROE, return on average tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity (ROTE), net earnings to average assets and return on average shareholders&#8217; equity are annualized amounts. 

&#8226; ROE is calculated by dividing annualized net earnings to common by average monthly common shareholders&#8217; equity. Tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity is calculated as total shareholders&#8217; equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. ROTE is calculated by dividing annualized net earnings to common by average monthly tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity. We believe that tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy and that ROTE is meaningful because it measures the performance of businesses consistently, whether they were acquired or developed internally. Tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity and ROTE are non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies. 

&#8226; Net earnings to average assets is calculated by dividing annualized net earnings by average total assets. 

&#8226; Return on shareholders&#8217; equity is calculated by dividing annualized net earnings by average monthly shareholders&#8217; equity. 

&#8226; Average equity to average assets is calculated by dividing average total shareholders&#8217; equity by average total assets. 

&#8226; Dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing dividends declared per common share by diluted EPS.

&#8226; Other principal transactions consists of revenues (excluding net interest) from our equity investing activities, including revenues related to our consolidated investments (included in our Asset Management segment), and debt investing and lending activities (included across our four segments). 

Operating Environment. During the third quarter of 2022, the operating environment continued to be generally characterized by broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and market volatility, which contributed to a decrease in global equity prices compared with the end of the second quarter of 2022. These factors contributed to solid market-making activity levels, a decline in industry-wide mergers and acquisitions transactions volumes and low industry-wide underwriting volumes. Additionally, global central banks continued to react to inflationary pressures by generally increasing policy interest rates. 

If concerns about the economic outlook grow, including those about the continuation or escalation of geopolitical events, inflation and supply chain complications, and the persistence of COVID-19-related effects, it may lead to a continued decline in equity prices, a continued widening of credit spreads, a decline in market-making activity levels, or a continued decline in investment banking volumes, and net revenues and provision for credit losses would likely be negatively impacted. See &#8220;Segment Assets and Operating Results &#8212; Segment Operating Results&#8221; for information about the operating environment and material trends and uncertainties that may impact our results of operations. 

Three Months Ended September 2022 versus September 2021. Net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $11.98 billion for the third quarter of 2022, 12% lower than a strong third quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting significantly lower investment banking revenues and other principal transactions revenues, partially offset by higher market making revenues and significantly higher net interest income. 

Non-Interest Revenues. Investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $1.54 billion for the third quarter of 2022, 57% lower than a strong third quarter of 2021, due to significantly lower revenues in both equity underwriting and debt underwriting, reflecting a significant decline in industry-wide activity, and in financial advisory, reflecting a significant decline in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions compared with elevated activity levels in the prior year period. 

Investment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $2.28 billion for the third quarter of 2022, 6% higher than the third quarter of 2021, due to higher management and other fees, reflecting the inclusion of NN Investment Partners (NNIP) and the impact of fee waivers on money market funds in the prior year period. 

Commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $995 million for the third quarter of 2022, 16% higher than the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to higher commissions and fees in Equities, reflecting generally higher volumes. 

Market making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $4.64 billion for the third quarter of 2022, 18% higher than the third quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting significantly higher revenues in interest rate products and currencies, partially offset by significantly lower revenues in equity products. 

Other principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $478 million for the third quarter of 2022, 70% lower than the third quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting significantly lower net gains from investments in private equities and, to a lesser extent, from debt investments, partially offset by mark-to-market net gains from investments in public equities compared with significant net losses in the third quarter of 2021. 

Net Interest Income. Net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $2.04 billion for the third quarter of 2022, 31% higher than the third quarter of 2021, reflecting an increase in interest income primarily related to collateralized agreements, deposits with banks, and other interest-earning assets, each reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates, and loans, reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates and higher average balances. The increase in interest income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to other interest-bearing liabilities, deposits, collateralized financings, and borrowings, each reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates. See &#8220;Statistical Disclosures &#8212; Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders&#8217; Equity&#8221; for further information about our sources of net interest income. 

Nine Months Ended September 2022 versus September 2021. Net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $36.77 billion for the first nine months of 2022, 21% lower than a strong first nine months of 2021, primarily reflecting significantly lower other principal transactions revenues and investment banking revenues, partially offset by higher market making revenues and significantly higher net interest income. 

Non-Interest Revenues. Investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $5.46 billion for the first nine months of 2022, 48% lower than the first nine months of 2021, due to significantly lower revenues in both equity and debt underwriting, reflecting a significant decline in industry-wide activity, and lower revenues in financial advisory, reflecting a decline in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Investment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $6.73 billion for the first nine months of 2022, 15% higher than the first nine months of 2021, primarily due to higher management and other fees, reflecting the inclusion of NNIP, the impact of fee waivers on money market funds in the prior year period and the impact of higher average assets under supervision. 

Commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $3.08 billion for the first nine months of 2022, 11% higher than the first nine months of 2021, primarily due to higher commissions and fees in Equities, reflecting generally higher volumes. 

Market making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $15.56 billion for the first nine months of 2022, 19% higher than the first nine months of 2021, primarily reflecting significantly higher revenues in currencies, interest rate products and commodities, partially offset by lower revenues in equity products and negative revenues in mortgages. 

Other principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $338 million for the first nine months of 2022, compared with $9.76 billion for the first nine months of 2021, primarily reflecting significantly lower net gains from investments in private equities, significant mark-to-market net losses from investments in public equities and net mark-downs in debt investments compared with net mark-ups in the prior year period. 

Net Interest Income. Net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $5.60 billion for the first nine months of 2022, 20% higher than the first nine months of 2021, reflecting an increase in interest income primarily related to collateralized agreements, other interest-earning assets and deposits with banks, each reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates, and loans, reflecting the impact of higher average balances and higher interest rates. The increase in interest income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense primarily related to other interest-bearing liabilities, collateralized financings, and borrowings, each reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates, and deposits, reflecting the impact of higher average interest rates and higher average balances. See &#8220;Statistical Disclosures &#8212; Distribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders&#8217; Equity&#8221; for further information about our sources of net interest income. 

Provision for Credit Losses 

Provision for credit losses consists of provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the provision for credit losses. 

The table below presents our provision for credit losses. 

Three Months Ended September Nine Months Ended September $ in millions 2022 2021 2022 2021 Provision for credit losses $ 515 &#160; $ 175 $ 1,743 &#160; $ 13 

Three Months Ended September 2022 versus September 2021. Provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of earnings was $515 million for the third quarter of 2022, compared with $175 million for the third quarter of 2021. Provisions for the third quarter of 2022 primarily reflected consumer portfolio growth, net charge-offs and the continued impact of broad macroeconomic concerns. The third quarter of 2021 primarily reflected provisions related to portfolio growth (primarily in credit cards). 

Nine Months Ended September 2022 versus September 2021. Provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of earnings was $1.74 billion for the first nine months of 2022, compared with $13 million for the first nine months of 2021. Provisions for the first nine months of 2022 primarily reflected consumer portfolio growth (primarily in credit cards) and the impact of broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns. The first nine months of 2021 reflected portfolio growth, largely offset by reserve reductions as the broad economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Operating Expenses 

Our operating expenses are primarily influenced by compensation, headcount and levels of business activity. Compensation and benefits includes salaries, estimated year-end discretionary compensation, amortization of equity awards and other items such as benefits. Discretionary compensation is significantly impacted by, among other factors, the level of net revenues net of provision for credit losses, overall financial performance, prevailing labor markets, business mix, the structure of our share-based compensation programs and the external environment. 

The table below presents our operating expenses by line item and headcount.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Three Months Ended September 2022 versus September 2021 . Operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $7.70 billion for the third quarter of 2022, 17% higher than the third quarter of 2021. Our efficiency ratio for the third quarter of 2022 was 64.3%, compared with 48.4% for the third quarter of 2021. 

The increase in operating expenses compared with the third quarter of 2021 included higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting a smaller reduction in the year-to-date ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues, net of provision for credit losses, compared with the prior year period), the inclusion of NNIP and GreenSky, Inc. (GreenSky), higher net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings, and higher transaction based expenses. While certain non-compensation expenses (e.g., occupancy and market development) were impacted by inflationary pressures, the overall impact of higher inflation was not material for the three months ended September 2022. 

Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for the third quarter of 2022 were $191 million compared with $52 million for the third quarter of 2021. 

Headcount increased 4% compared with June 2022, primarily reflecting the timing of campus hires and investments in growth initiatives. 

Nine Months Ended September 2022 versus September 2021. Operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $23.07 billion for the first nine months of 2022, 6% lower than the first nine months of 2021. Our efficiency ratio for the first nine months of 2022 was 62.7%, compared with our medium-term target efficiency ratio of approximately 60.0%. Our efficiency ratio for the first nine months of 2021 was 52.8%. 

The decrease in operating expenses compared with the first nine months of 2021 was due to significantly lower compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting a decline in operating performance compared with a strong prior year period), partially offset by increases from the inclusion of NNIP and GreenSky, technology expenses, market development expenses, transaction based expenses and professional fees. 

Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for the first nine months of 2022 were $407 million compared with $352 million for the first nine months of 2021. 

As of September 2022, headcount increased 12% compared with December 2021, primarily reflecting investments in growth initiatives and the acquisitions of NNIP and GreenSky. 

Provision for Taxes 

The effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2022 was 16.9%, down from the full year income tax rate of 20.0% for 2021, primarily due to an increase in the impact of permanent tax benefits in the first nine months of 2022 compared with the full year of 2021. The increase compared with 16.3% for the first half of 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in the impact of tax benefits on the settlement of employee share-based awards in the first nine months of 2022 compared with the first half of 2022. 

The Finance Act 2022, which decreases the U.K. bank surcharge tax rate by 5% from April 1, 2023, was enacted in February 2022. This bank surcharge is currently applicable to certain of our U.K. subsidiaries and branches, including Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and Goldman Sachs International Bank (GSIB). During the first nine months of 2022, certain U.K. deferred tax assets and liabilities were remeasured and a net reduction in deferred tax assets of approximately $50 million was recognized. 

In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes income tax incentives to encourage investments in clean energy and a new 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT). The CAMT applies to corporations with average annual profits over $1 billion and is calculated on their financial statement income, with certain adjustments, for years beginning after December 31, 2022. The legislation will have no impact on our 2022 annual effective tax rate and based on our current understanding of the CAMT, is not expected to have a material impact on our 2023 annual effective tax rate.

Net revenues in our segments include allocations of interest income and expense to specific positions in relation to the cash generated by, or funding requirements of, such positions. See Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our business segments. 

The allocation of common shareholders&#8217; equity and preferred stock dividends to each segment is based on the estimated amount of equity required to support the activities of the segment under relevant regulatory capital requirements. Net earnings for each segment is calculated by applying the firmwide tax rate to each segment&#8217;s pre-tax earnings. 

We review and make any necessary adjustments to attributed equity in January of each year, to reflect, among other things, the results of the latest Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process, as well as projected changes in our balance sheet. See &#8220;Capital Management and Regulatory Capital &#8212; Capital Management&#8221; for information about the impact of these updates on the allocation of attributed equity among our segments as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2022. The average common equity balances above incorporate such impact, as well as the changes in the size and composition of assets held in each of our segments that occurred during the respective periods. 

Compensation and benefits expenses within our segments reflect, among other factors, our overall performance, as well as the performance of individual businesses. Consequently, pre-tax margins in one segment of our business may be significantly affected by the performance of our other business segments. A description of segment operating results follows.

In the table above: 

&#8226; Volumes are per Dealogic. 

&#8226; Announced and completed mergers and acquisitions volumes are based on full credit to each of the advisors in a transaction. Equity and equity-related and debt offerings are based on full credit for single book managers and equal credit for joint book managers. Transaction volumes may not be indicative of net revenues in a given period. In addition, transaction volumes for prior periods may vary from amounts previously reported due to the subsequent withdrawal or a change in the value of a transaction. 

&#8226; Equity and equity-related offerings includes Rule 144A and public common stock offerings, convertible offerings and rights offerings. 

&#8226; Debt offerings includes non-convertible preferred stock, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and taxable municipal debt. Includes publicly registered and Rule 144A issues and excludes leveraged loans. 

Operating Environment. During the third quarter of 2022, Investment Banking operated in an environment generally characterized by continued broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns. As a result, compared with the second quarter of 2022, industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions declined, industry-wide equity underwriting volumes remained low amid volatile equity markets and a decline in prices, and industry-wide debt underwriting volumes declined across leveraged finance and investment-grade issuances amid rising interest rates. 

In the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate further, and industry-wide mergers and acquisitions transactions and underwriting volumes continue to decline, or credit spreads related to hedges on our relationship lending portfolio tighten further, net revenues in Investment Banking would likely be negatively impacted. In addition, if economic conditions deteriorate further or if the creditworthiness of borrowers deteriorates, provision for credit losses would likely be negatively impacted. 

Three Months Ended September 2022 versus September 2021. Net revenues in Investment Banking were $1.58 billion for the third quarter of 2022, 57% lower than a strong third quarter of 2021, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in Underwriting, Financial advisory and Corporate lending. 

The decrease in Underwriting net revenues was due to significantly lower net revenues in both Equity and Debt underwriting, reflecting a significant decline in industry-wide volumes. The decrease in Financial advisory net revenues reflected a significant decline in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions from elevated activity levels in the prior year period. The decrease in Corporate lending net revenues was primarily due to net mark-downs on acquisition financing activities and net losses on hedges. 

Provision for credit losses was $78 million for the third quarter of 2022, compared with $41 million for the third quarter of 2021. Provisions in the third quarter of 2022 reflected the continued impact of broad macroeconomic concerns.

Operating expenses were $1.04 billion for the third quarter of 2022, 23% lower than the third quarter of 2021, reflecting significantly lower compensation and benefits expenses. Pre-tax earnings were $460 million for the third quarter of 2022, 80% lower than the third quarter of 2021. 

As of September 2022, our investment banking transaction backlog was essentially unchanged compared with June 2022. 

Our backlog represents an estimate of our net revenues from future transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not. We believe changes in our backlog may be a useful indicator of client activity levels which, over the long term, impact our net revenues. However, the time frame for completion and corresponding revenue recognition of transactions in our backlog varies based on the nature of the assignment, as certain transactions may remain in our backlog for longer periods of time. In addition, our backlog is subject to certain limitations, such as assumptions about the likelihood that individual client transactions will occur in the future. Transactions may be cancelled or modified, and transactions not included in the estimate may also occur. 

Nine Months Ended September 2022 versus September 2021. Net revenues in Investment Banking were $6.12 billion for the first nine months of 2022, 45% lower than the first nine months of 2021, primarily reflecting significantly lower net revenues in Underwriting and lower net revenues in Financial advisory. 

The decrease in Underwriting net revenues was due to significantly lower net revenues in both Equity and Debt underwriting, reflecting a significant decline in industry-wide volumes. The decrease in Financial advisory reflected a decline in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions transactions. Corporate lending net revenues were significantly higher, primarily due to net gains from hedges related to relationship lending activities compared with net losses in the prior year period and higher net revenues from transaction banking, partially offset by net mark-downs on acquisition financing activities. 

Provision for credit losses was $325 million for the first nine months of 2022, compared with a net benefit of $229 million for the first nine months of 2021. Provisions for the first nine months of 2022 primarily reflected the impact of broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, while the net benefit in the first nine months of 2021 reflected reserve reductions as the broad economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Operating expenses were $3.39 billion for the first nine months of 2022, 34% lower than the first nine months of 2021, primarily reflecting significantly lower compensation and benefits expenses. Pre-tax earnings were $2.41 billion for the first nine months of 2022, 61% lower than the first nine months of 2021. 

As of September 2022, our investment banking transaction backlog decreased compared with December 2021, due to significantly lower estimated net revenues from potential debt underwriting transactions (primarily from leveraged finance transactions).

Includes providing financing to our clients through warehouse loans backed by mortgages (including residential and commercial mortgage loans), corporate loans and consumer loans (including auto loans and private student loans). We also provide financing to clients through structured credit, asset-backed lending, and through securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements). 

Equities. Equities generates revenues from intermediation and financing activities. 

&#8226; Equities intermediation. We make markets in equity securities and equity-related products, including ETFs, convertible securities, options, futures and OTC derivative instruments. We also structure and make markets in derivatives on indices, industry sectors, financial measures and individual company stocks. Our exchange-based market-making activities include making markets in stocks and ETFs, futures and options on major exchanges worldwide. In addition, we generate commissions and fees from executing and clearing institutional client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide, as well as OTC transactions. For further information about market-making activities, see &#8220;Market-Making Activities&#8221; below. 

&#8226; Equities financing. Includes prime brokerage and other equities financing activities, including securities lending, margin lending and swaps. We earn fees by providing clearing, settlement and custody services globally. We provide services that principally involve borrowing and lending securities to cover institutional clients&#8217; short sales and borrowing securities to cover our short sales and to make deliveries into the market. In addition, we are an active participant in broker-to-broker securities lending and third-party agency lending activities. We provide financing to our clients for their securities trading activities through margin loans that are collateralized by securities, cash or other acceptable collateral. In addition, we execute swap transactions to provide our clients with exposure to securities and indices. 

Market-Making Activities 

As a market maker, we facilitate transactions in both liquid and less liquid markets, primarily for institutional clients, such as corporations, financial institutions, investment funds and governments, to assist clients in meeting their investment objectives and in managing their risks. In this role, we seek to earn the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing to sell an instrument to us and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it from us, and vice versa (i.e., bid/offer spread). In addition, we maintain (i) market-making positions, typically for a short period of time, in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand, and (ii) positions to actively manage our risk exposures that arise from these market-making activities (collectively, inventory). Our inventory is recorded in trading assets (long positions) or trading liabilities (short positions) in our consolidated balance sheets. 

Our results are influenced by a combination of interconnected drivers, including (i) client activity levels and transactional bid/offer spreads (collectively, client activity), and (ii) changes in the fair value of our inventory and interest income and interest expense related to the holding, hedging and funding of our inventory (collectively, market-making inventory changes). Due to the integrated nature of our market-making activities, disaggregation of net revenues into client activity and market-making inventory changes is judgmental and has inherent complexities and limitations. 

The amount and composition of our net revenues vary over time as these drivers are impacted by multiple interrelated factors affecting economic and market conditions, including volatility and liquidity in the market, changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit spreads, equity prices and commodity prices, investor confidence, and other macroeconomic concerns and uncertainties. 

In general, assuming all other market-making conditions remain constant, increases in client activity levels or bid/offer spreads tend to result in increases in net revenues, and decreases tend to have the opposite effect. However, changes in market-making conditions can materially impact client activity levels and bid/offer spreads, as well as the fair value of our inventory. For example, a decrease in liquidity in the market could have the impact of (i) increasing our bid/offer spread, (ii) decreasing investor confidence and thereby decreasing client activity levels, and (iii) widening of credit spreads on our inventory positions.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Operating Environment. During the third quarter of 2022, Global Markets continued to operate in an environment generally characterized by broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and market volatility, which contributed to solid client activity and a decrease in global equity prices. For volatility, the average daily VIX for the third quarter of 2022 was 25, consistent with the average year-to-date level. In equities, the S&#38;P 500 Index decreased by 5% and the MSCI World Index decreased by 7%, compared with the end of the second quarter of 2022. Additionally, global central banks continued to react to inflationary pressures by generally increasing policy interest rates. 

In the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate further, and activity levels or volatility decline, net revenues in Global Markets would likely be negatively impacted. 

Three Months Ended September 2022 versus September 2021. Net revenues in Global Markets were $6.20 billion for the third quarter of 2022, 11% higher than the third quarter of 2021. 

Net revenues in FICC were $3.53 billion, 41% higher than the third quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in FICC intermediation, driven by significantly higher net revenues in interest rate products and currencies, and higher net revenues in commodities and credit products, partially offset by significantly lower net revenues in mortgages. In addition, net revenues in FICC financing were significantly higher, primarily driven by securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) and mortgage lending. 

The increase in FICC intermediation net revenues reflected significantly higher client activity as we supported clients amid an evolving macroeconomic environment. The following provides information about our FICC intermediation net revenues by business, compared with results in the third quarter of 2021: 

&#8226; Net revenues in interest rate products, currencies, commodities and credit products primarily reflected higher client activity. 

&#8226; Net revenues in mortgages primarily reflected the impact of challenging market-making conditions on our inventory. 

Net revenues in Equities were $2.68 billion, 14% lower than a strong third quarter of 2021, primarily due to lower net revenues in Equities intermediation, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in cash products and lower net revenues in derivatives. Net revenues in Equities financing were slightly lower. 

Provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $43 million for the third quarter of 2022, compared with a net benefit of $24 million for the third quarter of 2021. 

Operating expenses were $3.21 billion for the third quarter of 2022, 15% higher than the third quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses and higher transaction based expenses. Pre-tax earnings were $3.03 billion for the third quarter of 2022, 7% higher than the third quarter of 2021. 

Nine Months Ended September 2022 versus September 2021. Net revenues in Global Markets were $20.54 billion for the first nine months of 2022, 14% higher than the first nine months of 2021. 

Net revenues in FICC were $11.86 billion, 36% higher than the first nine months of 2021, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in FICC intermediation, driven by significantly higher net revenues in currencies, interest rate products and commodities, partially offset by significantly lower net revenues in mortgages and credit products. Net revenues in FICC financing were also significantly higher, reflecting significantly higher net revenues from mortgage lending and repurchase agreements. 

The increase in FICC intermediation net revenues reflected significantly higher client activity as we supported clients amid an evolving macroeconomic environment. The following provides information about our FICC intermediation net revenues by business, compared with results in the first nine months of 2021: 

&#8226; Net revenues in currencies, interest rate products and commodities primarily reflected higher client activity. 

&#8226; Net revenues in mortgages and credit products primarily reflected the impact of challenging market-making conditions on our inventory. 

Net revenues in Equities were $8.69 billion, 7% lower than the first nine months of 2021, due to lower net revenues in Equities intermediation, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in cash products and slightly lower net revenues in derivatives. Net revenues in Equities financing were slightly higher, primarily reflecting increased activity. 

Provision for credit losses was $190 million for the first nine months of 2022, compared with a net benefit of $30 million for the first nine months of 2021. Provisions for the first nine months of 2022 primarily reflected the impact of broad concerns about the macroeconomic outlook. 

Operating expenses were $10.34 billion for the first nine months of 2022, essentially unchanged compared with the first nine months of 2021. Pre-tax earnings were $10.01 billion for the first nine months of 2022, 29% higher than the first nine months of 2021.

Asset Management 

We manage client assets across a broad range of investment strategies and asset classes for a diverse set of institutional clients and a network of third-party distributors around the world, including equity, fixed income and alternative investments. We provide investment solutions, including those managed on a fiduciary basis by our portfolio managers, as well as those managed by third-party managers. We offer our investment solutions in a variety of structures, including separately managed accounts, mutual funds, private partnerships and other commingled vehicles. These solutions begin with identifying clients&#8217; objectives and continue through portfolio construction, ongoing asset allocation and risk management and investment realization. 

In addition to managing client assets, we invest in alternative investments across a range of asset classes that seek to deliver long-term accretive risk-adjusted returns. Our investing activities, which are typically longer-term, include investments in corporate equity, credit, real estate and infrastructure assets. 

Asset Management generates revenues from the following: 

&#8226; Management and other fees. The majority of revenues in management and other fees consists of asset-based fees on client assets that we manage. For further information about assets under supervision (AUS), see &#8220;Assets Under Supervision&#8221; below. The fees that we charge vary by asset class, distribution channel and the types of services provided, and are affected by investment performance, as well as asset inflows and redemptions. 

&#8226; Incentive fees. In certain circumstances, we also receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund&#8217;s or a separately managed account&#8217;s return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets. Such fees include overrides, which consist of the increased share of the income and gains derived primarily from our private equity and credit funds when the return on a fund&#8217;s investments over the life of the fund exceeds certain threshold returns. 

&#8226; Equity investments. Our alternative investing activities relate to public and private equity investments in corporate, real estate and infrastructure entities. We also make investments through consolidated investment entities (CIEs), substantially all of which are engaged in real estate investment activities. 

&#8226; Lending and debt investments. We invest in corporate debt and provide financing for real estate and other assets. These activities include investments in mezzanine debt, senior debt and distressed debt securities.

Operating Environment. During the third quarter of 2022, Asset Management operated in an environment generally characterized by continued broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and market volatility, which contributed to a further decrease in global equity prices compared to the second quarter of 2022. Additionally, global central banks continued to react to inflationary pressures by generally increasing policy interest rates. 

In the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate further, it may lead to a continued decline in asset prices or widening of credit spreads, or investors transitioning to asset classes that typically generate lower fees or withdrawing their assets, and net revenues in Asset Management would likely continue to be negatively impacted. 

Three Months Ended September 2022 versus September 2021. Net revenues in Asset Management were $1.82 billion for the third quarter of 2022, 20% lower than the third quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting significantly lower net revenues in Equity investments and Lending and debt investments, partially offset by significantly higher net revenues in Management and other fees. 

The decrease in Equity investments net revenues reflected significantly lower net gains from investments in private equities, partially offset by mark-to-market net gains from investments in public equities compared with significant net losses in the third quarter of 2021. The decrease in Lending and debt investments net revenues primarily reflected net mark-downs compared with net mark-ups in the prior year period. Incentive fees were lower, driven by harvesting in the prior year period. The increase in Management and other fees reflected the inclusion of NNIP in the current period and the impact of fee waivers on money market funds in the prior year period. 

Provision for credit losses was $29 million for the third quarter of 2022, compared with $10 million for the third quarter of 2021. 

Operating expenses were $1.57 billion for the third quarter of 2022, 90% higher than the third quarter of 2021, reflecting significantly higher compensation and benefits expenses and the inclusion of operating expenses related to NNIP following its acquisition in April 2022. Pre-tax earnings were $227 million for the third quarter of 2022, 84% lower than the third quarter of 2021. 

Nine Months Ended September 2022 versus September 2021. Net revenues in Asset Management were $3.45 billion for the first nine months of 2022, 71% lower than the first nine months of 2021, reflecting significantly lower net revenues in Equity investments and Lending and debt investments, partially offset by significantly higher Management and other fees. 

The decrease in Equity investments net revenues reflected significantly lower net gains from investments in private equities and significant mark-to-market net losses from investments in public equities. The decrease in Lending and debt investments net revenues primarily reflected net mark-downs compared with net mark-ups in the prior year period. The increase in Management and other fees reflected the inclusion of NNIP and the impact of fee waivers on money market funds in the prior year period. Incentive fees were higher. 

Provision for credit losses was $129 million for the first nine months of 2022, compared with net benefit of $2 million for the first nine months of 2021. Provisions for the first nine months of 2022 primarily reflected the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns, while the net benefit in the first nine months of 2021 included reserve reductions as the broad economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Operating expenses were $4.12 billion for the first nine months of 2022, 11% lower than the first nine months of 2021, reflecting significantly lower compensation and benefits expenses, partially offset by the inclusion of operating expenses related to NNIP following its acquisition in April 2022. Pre-tax loss was $799 million for the first nine months of 2022, compared to pre-tax earnings of $7.37 billion for the first nine months of 2021.

Consumer &#38; Wealth Management 

Consumer &#38; Wealth Management helps clients achieve their individual financial goals by providing a broad range of wealth advisory and banking services, including financial planning, investment management, deposit-taking and lending. Services are offered through our global network of advisors and via our digital platforms. 

Wealth Management. Wealth management provides tailored wealth advisory services to clients across the wealth spectrum. We operate globally serving individuals, families, family offices, and foundations and endowments. Our relationships are established directly or introduced through corporations that sponsor financial wellness programs for their employees. 

We offer personalized financial planning inclusive of income and liability management, compensation and benefits analysis, trust and estate structuring, tax optimization, philanthropic giving, and asset protection. We also provide customized investment advisory solutions, and offer structuring and execution capabilities in security and derivative products across all major global markets. We leverage a broad, open-architecture investment platform and our global execution capabilities to help clients achieve their investment goals. In addition, we offer clients a full range of private banking services, including a variety of deposit alternatives and loans that our clients use to finance investments in both financial and nonfinancial assets, bridge cash flow timing gaps or provide liquidity and flexibility for other needs. 

Wealth management generates revenues from the following: 

&#8226; Management and other fees. Includes fees related to managing assets, providing investing and wealth advisory solutions, providing financial planning and counseling services via Ayco Personal Financial Management, and executing brokerage transactions for wealth management clients. 

&#8226; Incentive fees. In certain circumstances, we also receive incentive fees from wealth management clients based on a percentage of a fund&#8217;s return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets. Such fees include overrides, which consist of the increased share of the income and gains derived primarily from our private equity and credit funds when the return on a fund&#8217;s investments over the life of the fund exceeds certain threshold returns. 

&#8226; Private banking and lending. Includes net interest income allocated to deposit-taking and net interest income earned on lending activities for wealth management clients. 

Consumer Banking. Our Consumer banking business issues unsecured loans, through our digital platform, Marcus by Goldman Sachs (Marcus), and credit cards, to finance the purchases of goods or services. We also accept deposits (including savings and time deposits) through Marcus, in Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA) and GSIB. Additionally, we provide investing services through Marcus Invest to U.S. customers. The acquisition of GreenSky in March 2022 expanded our offering of point-of-sale financing. 

Consumer banking revenues consist of net interest income earned on unsecured loans issued to consumers through Marcus and credit card lending activities, and net interest income attributed to consumer deposits.

Operating Environment. During the third quarter of 2022, Consumer &#38; Wealth Management continued to operate in an environment generally characterized by broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns and market volatility, which contributed to a decrease in asset prices compared with the end of the second quarter of 2022. For consumer banking activities, in the U.S., the rate of unemployment remained low and consumer spending increased slightly compared with the second quarter of 2022. Additionally, global central banks continued to react to inflationary pressures by generally increasing policy interest rates. 

In the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate further, it may lead to a continued decline in asset prices, or investors transitioning to asset classes that typically generate lower fees or withdrawing their assets, or consumers withdrawing their deposits or a deterioration in consumer credit, and net revenues and provision for credit losses in Consumer &#38; Wealth Management would likely be negatively impacted. 

Three Months Ended September 2022 versus September 2021. Net revenues in Consumer &#38; Wealth Management were $2.38 billion for the third quarter of 2022, 18% higher than the third quarter of 2021. 

Net revenues in Wealth management were $1.63 billion, essentially unchanged compared with the third quarter of 2021, reflecting significantly lower Incentive fees, driven by harvesting in the prior year period, offset by significantly higher net revenues in Private banking and lending, due to the impact of higher loan and deposit balances. Management and other fees were essentially unchanged. 

Net revenues in Consumer banking were $744 million, nearly double the amount in the third quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting significantly higher credit card balances and higher deposit spreads. 

Provision for credit losses was $451 million for the third quarter of 2022, compared with $148 million for the third quarter of 2021. Provisions in the third quarter of 2022 reflected consumer portfolio growth (primarily in credit cards) and net charge-offs, while the third quarter of 2021 primarily reflected growth in credit cards. 

Operating expenses were $1.89 billion for the third quarter of 2022, 16% higher than the third quarter of 2021, primarily reflecting higher spend on growth initiatives in Consumer banking, including the operating expenses related to GreenSky following its acquisition in March 2022. Pre-tax earnings were $38 million for the third quarter of 2022, 84% lower than the third quarter of 2021. 

Nine Months Ended September 2022 versus September 2021. Net revenues in Consumer &#38; Wealth Management were $6.66 billion for the first nine months of 2022, 21% higher than the first nine months of 2021. 

Net revenues in Wealth management were $4.82 billion, 10% higher than the first nine months of 2021, due to higher Management and other fees, primarily reflecting the impact of higher average assets under supervision, and significantly higher net revenues in Private banking and lending, reflecting higher loan and deposit balances. These increases were partially offset by lower Incentive fees, driven by harvesting in the prior year period. 

Net revenues in Consumer banking were $1.84 billion, 64% higher than the first nine months of 2021, primarily reflecting significantly higher credit card balances and higher deposit spreads. 

Provision for credit losses was $1.10 billion for the first nine months of 2022, compared with $274 million for the first nine months of 2021. Provisions for the first nine months of 2022 primarily reflected consumer portfolio growth (primarily in credit cards) and net charge-offs, while the first nine months of 2021 included reserve reductions as the broad economic environment continued to improve following the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Operating expenses were $5.22 billion for the first nine months of 2022, 16% higher than the first nine months of 2021, primarily reflecting higher spend on growth initiatives in Consumer banking, including the operating expenses related to GreenSky following its acquisition in March 2022. Pre-tax earnings were $337 million for the first nine months of 2022, 54% lower than the first nine months of 2021.

AUS includes our institutional clients&#8217; assets and assets sourced through third-party distributors (both included in our Asset Management segment), as well as high-net-worth clients&#8217; assets (included in our Consumer &#38; Wealth Management segment), where we earn a fee for managing assets on a discretionary basis. This includes net assets in our mutual funds, hedge funds, credit funds, private equity funds, real estate funds, and separately managed accounts for institutional and individual investors. AUS also includes client assets invested with third-party managers, private bank deposits and advisory relationships where we earn a fee for advisory and other services, but do not have investment discretion. AUS does not include the self-directed brokerage assets of our clients.

In addition to our AUS, we have discretion over alternative investments where we currently do not earn management fees (non-fee-earning alternative assets). 

We earn management fees on client assets that we manage and also receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund&#8217;s or a separately managed account&#8217;s return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets. These incentive fees are recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur. Our estimated unrecognized incentive fees were $3.57 billion as of September 2022 and $3.39 billion as of December 2021. Such amounts are based on the completion of the funds&#8217; financial statements, which is generally one quarter in arrears. These fees will be recognized, assuming no decline in fair value, if and when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur, which is generally when such fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the market value of the assets.

Balance Sheet and Funding Sources 

Balance Sheet Management 

One of our risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet. While our asset base changes due to client activity, market fluctuations and business opportunities, the size and composition of our balance sheet also reflects factors, including (i) our overall risk tolerance, (ii) the amount of capital we hold and (iii) our funding profile, among other factors. See &#8220;Capital Management and Regulatory Capital &#8212; Capital Management&#8221; for information about our capital management process. 

Although our balance sheet fluctuates on a day-to-day basis, our total assets at quarter-end and year-end dates are generally not materially different from those occurring within our reporting periods. 

In order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities, which include (i) balance sheet planning, (ii) balance sheet limits, (iii) monitoring of key metrics and (iv) scenario analyses. 

Balance Sheet Planning. We prepare a balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and composition of assets with our expected funding sources over a three-year time horizon. This plan is reviewed quarterly and may be adjusted in response to changing business needs or market conditions. The objectives of this planning process are: 

&#8226; To develop our balance sheet projections, taking into account the general state of the financial markets and expected business activity levels, as well as regulatory requirements; 

&#8226; To allow Treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions to objectively evaluate balance sheet limit requests from our revenue-producing units in the context of our overall balance sheet constraints, including our liability profile and capital levels, and key metrics; and 

&#8226; To inform the target amount, tenor and type of funding to raise, based on our projected assets and contractual maturities. 

Treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions, along with our revenue-producing units, review current and prior period information and expectations for the year to prepare our balance sheet plan. The specific information reviewed includes asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization, risk and performance measures, and capital usage.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Our consolidated balance sheet plan, including our balance sheets by business, funding projections and projected key metrics, is reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee and the Risk Governance Committee. See &#8220;Risk Management &#8212; Overview and Structure of Risk Management&#8221; for an overview of our risk management structure. 

Balance Sheet Limits. The Firmwide Asset Liability Committee and the Risk Governance Committee have the responsibility to review and approve balance sheet limits. These limits are set at levels which are close to actual operating levels, rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite, in order to ensure prompt escalation and discussion among our revenue-producing units, Treasury and our independent risk oversight and control functions on a routine basis. Requests for changes in limits are evaluated after giving consideration to their impact on our key metrics. Compliance with limits is monitored by our revenue-producing units and Treasury, as well as our independent risk oversight and control functions. 

Monitoring of Key Metrics. We monitor key balance sheet metrics both by business and on a consolidated basis, including asset and liability size and composition, limit utilization and risk measures. We attribute assets to businesses and review and analyze movements resulting from new business activity, as well as market fluctuations. 

Scenario Analyses. We conduct various scenario analyses, including as part of the CCAR and U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Stress Tests (DFAST), as well as our resolution and recovery planning. See &#8220;Capital Management and Regulatory Capital &#8212; Capital Management&#8221; for further information about these scenario analyses. These scenarios cover short- and long-term time horizons using various macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions, based on a range of economic scenarios. We use these analyses to assist us in developing our longer-term balance sheet management strategy, including the level and composition of assets, funding and capital. Additionally, these analyses help us develop approaches for maintaining appropriate funding, liquidity and capital across a variety of situations, including a severely stressed environment. 

Balance Sheet Analysis and Metrics 

As of September 2022, total assets in our consolidated balance sheets were $1.56 trillion, an increase of $92.01 billion from December 2021, primarily reflecting increases in investments of $38.24 billion (primarily due to an increase in U.S. government obligations accounted for as held-to-maturity), cash and cash equivalents of $23.22 billion (primarily reflecting our activity), and loans of $18.11 billion (reflecting increases in corporate, consumer and wealth management loans). 

As of September 2022, total liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets were $1.44 trillion, an increase of $82.64 billion from December 2021, reflecting increases in trading liabilities of $50.29 billion (primarily due to an increase in equity securities, reflecting the impact of our and our clients' activities, and due to an increase in derivative instruments, reflecting the impact of currency, commodity prices and interest rate movements), deposits of $30.51 billion (primarily due to increases in transaction banking, deposit sweep program balances, brokered certificates of deposit, and consumer deposits, partially offset by a decrease in other deposits), and customer and other payables of $26.53 billion (primarily reflecting our clients' activities), partially offset by decreases in collateralized financings of $11.83 billion (primarily reflecting the impact of our and our clients' activities) and unsecured borrowings of $9.23 billion (primarily driven by maturities, partially offset by new issuances). 

Our total repurchase agreements, accounted for as collateralized financings, were $159.69 billion as of September 2022, which were essentially the same as the average daily amount over the third quarter of 2022. As of December 2021, total repurchase agreements were $165.88 billion, which were 3% higher than the average daily amount over the fourth quarter of 2021. 

The level of our repurchase agreements fluctuates between and within periods, primarily due to providing clients with access to highly liquid collateral, such as certain government and agency obligations, through collateralized financing activities.

The table below presents information about our balance sheet and leverage ratios. 

As of September December

In the table above: 

&#8226; The leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total shareholders&#8217; equity and measures the proportion of equity and debt we use to finance assets. This ratio is different from the leverage ratios included in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. 

&#8226; The debt-to-equity ratio equals unsecured long-term borrowings divided by total shareholders&#8217; equity. 

The table below presents information about our shareholders&#8217; equity and book value per common share, including the reconciliation of common shareholders&#8217; equity to tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity.

In the table above: 

&#8226; Tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity is calculated as total shareholders&#8217; equity less preferred stock, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. We believe that tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies. 

&#8226; Book value per common share and tangible book value per common share are based on common shares outstanding and restricted stock units granted to employees with no future service requirements and not subject to performance or market conditions (collectively, basic shares) of 352.3 million as of September 2022 and 348.9 million as of December 2021. We believe that tangible book value per common share (tangible common shareholders&#8217; equity divided by basic shares) is meaningful because it is a measure that we and investors use to assess capital adequacy. Tangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies. 

Funding Sources 

Our primary sources of funding are deposits, collateralized financings, unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, and shareholders&#8217; equity. We seek to maintain broad and diversified funding sources globally across products, programs, markets, currencies and creditors to avoid funding concentrations. 

The table below presents information about our funding sources. 

As of $ in millions September 2022 December 2021 Deposits $ 394,733 &#160; 39 &#160; % $ 364,227 36 % Collateralized financings 219,107 &#160; 21 &#160; % 230,932 23 % Unsecured short-term borrowings 51,850 &#160; 5 &#160; % 46,955 5 % Unsecured long-term borrowings 239,965 &#160; 23 &#160; % 254,092 25 % Total shareholders&#8217; equity 119,290 &#160; 12 &#160; % 109,926 11 % Total $ 1,024,945 &#160; 100 &#160; % $ 1,006,132 100 % 

Our funding is primarily raised in U.S. dollar, Euro, British pound and Japanese yen. We generally distribute our funding products through our own sales force and third-party distributors to a large, diverse creditor base in a variety of markets in the Americas, Europe and Asia. We believe that our relationships with our creditors are critical to our liquidity. Our creditors include banks, governments, securities lenders, corporations, pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and individuals. We have imposed various internal guidelines to monitor creditor concentration across our funding programs. 

Deposits. Our deposits provide us with a diversified source of funding and reduce our reliance on wholesale funding. We raise deposits, including savings, demand and time deposits, from private bank clients, consumers, transaction banking clients, other institutional clients, and through internal and third-party broker-dealers. Substantially all of our deposits are raised through GS Bank USA, GSIB and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (GSBE). See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our deposits, including a maturity profile of our time deposits.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Secured Funding. We fund a significant amount of inventory and a portion of investments on a secured basis. Secured funding includes collateralized financings in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our collateralized financings, including its maturity profile. We may also pledge our inventory and investments as collateral for securities borrowed under a securities lending agreement. We also use our own inventory and investments to cover transactions in which we or our clients have sold securities that have not yet been purchased. Secured funding is less sensitive to changes in our credit quality than unsecured funding, due to our posting of collateral to our lenders. Nonetheless, we analyze the refinancing risk of our secured funding activities, taking into account trade tenors, maturity profiles, counterparty concentrations, collateral eligibility and counterparty rollover probabilities. We seek to mitigate our refinancing risk by executing term trades with staggered maturities, diversifying counterparties, raising excess secured funding and pre-funding residual risk through our GCLA. 

We seek to raise secured funding with a term appropriate for the liquidity of the assets that are being financed, and we seek longer maturities for secured funding collateralized by asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis, especially during times of market stress. Our secured funding, excluding funding collateralized by liquid government and agency obligations, is primarily executed for tenors of one month or greater and is primarily executed through term repurchase agreements and securities loaned contracts. 

Assets that may be harder to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress include certain financial instruments in the following categories: mortgage- and other asset-backed loans and securities, non-investment-grade corporate debt securities, equity securities and emerging market securities. 

We also raise financing through other types of collateralized financings, such as secured loans and notes. GS Bank USA has access to funding from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Our outstanding borrowings against the Federal Home Loan Bank were $1.50 billion as of September 2022 and $100 million as of December 2021. Additionally, we have access to funding through the Federal Reserve discount window. However, we do not rely on this funding in our liquidity planning and stress testing. 

Unsecured Short-Term Borrowings. A significant portion of our unsecured short-term borrowings was originally long-term debt that is scheduled to mature within one year of the reporting date. We use unsecured short-term borrowings, including U.S. and non-U.S. hybrid financial instruments and commercial paper, to finance liquid assets and for other cash management purposes. In accordance with regulatory requirements, Group Inc. does not issue debt with an original maturity of less than one year, other than to its subsidiaries. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured short-term borrowings. 

Unsecured Long-Term Borrowings. Unsecured long-term borrowings, including structured notes, are raised through syndicated U.S. registered offerings, U.S. registered and Rule 144A medium-term note programs, offshore medium-term note offerings and other debt offerings. We issue in different tenors, currencies and products to maximize the diversification of our investor base.

The weighted average maturity of our unsecured long-term borrowings as of September 2022 was approximately seven years. To mitigate refinancing risk, we seek to limit the principal amount of debt maturing over the course of any monthly, quarterly or annual time horizon. We enter into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our unsecured long-term borrowings into floating-rate obligations to manage our exposure to interest rates. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured long-term borrowings. 

Shareholders&#8217; Equity. Shareholders&#8217; equity is a stable and perpetual source of funding. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our shareholders&#8217; equity.

Capital Management and Regulatory Capital 

Capital adequacy is of critical importance to us. We have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to assist us in maintaining the appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions. 

Capital Management 

We determine the appropriate amount and composition of our capital by considering multiple factors, including our current and future regulatory capital requirements, the results of our capital planning and stress testing process, the results of resolution capital models and other factors, such as rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment and conditions in the financial markets. 

We manage our capital requirements and the levels of our capital usage principally by setting limits on the balance sheet and/or limits on risk, in each case at both the firmwide and business levels. 

We principally manage the level and composition of our capital through issuances and repurchases of our common stock. 

We may issue, redeem or repurchase our preferred stock and other subordinated debt or other forms of capital as business conditions warrant. Prior to such redemptions or repurchases, we must receive approval from the FRB. See Notes 14 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our preferred stock and other subordinated debt. 

Capital Planning and Stress Testing Process. As part of capital planning, we project sources and uses of capital given a range of business environments, including stressed conditions. Our stress testing process is designed to identify and measure material risks associated with our business activities, including market risk, credit risk, operational risk and liquidity risk, as well as our ability to generate revenues. 

Our capital planning process incorporates an internal capital adequacy assessment with the objective of ensuring that we are appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our businesses. We incorporate stress scenarios into our capital planning process with a goal of holding sufficient capital to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe stress event. Our assessment of capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy and is integrated into our overall risk management structure, governance and policy framework. 

Our stress tests incorporate our internally designed stress scenarios, including our internally developed severely adverse scenario, and those required by the FRB, and are designed to capture our specific vulnerabilities and risks. We provide further information about our stress test processes and a summary of the results on our website as described in &#8220;Available Information.&#8221; 

As required by the FRB&#8217;s CCAR rules, we submit an annual capital plan for review by the FRB. The purpose of the FRB&#8217;s review is to ensure that we have a robust, forward-looking capital planning process that accounts for our unique risks and that permits continued operation during times of economic and financial stress. 

The FRB evaluates us based, in part, on whether we have the capital necessary to continue operating under the baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB and those developed internally. This evaluation also takes into account our process for identifying risk, our controls and governance for capital planning, and our guidelines for making capital planning decisions. In addition, the FRB evaluates our plan to make capital distributions (i.e., dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions of stock, subordinated debt or other capital securities) and issue capital, across the range of macroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific assumptions. The FRB determines the stress capital buffer (SCB) applicable to us based on its own annual stress test. The SCB under the Standardized approach is calculated as (i) the difference between our starting and minimum projected CET1 capital ratios under the supervisory severely adverse scenario and (ii) our planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon, expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets (RWAs). 

Based on our 2022 CCAR submission, the FRB reduced our SCB from 6.4% to 6.3% for the period from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023. As a result, beginning on October 1, 2022, our Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement is 13.3%. Additionally, effective January 1, 2023, our global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge will increase from 2.5% to 3.0%, resulting in a Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement of 13.8%. See &#8220;Share Repurchase Program&#8221; for further information about common stock repurchases and dividends and &#8220;Consolidated Regulatory Capital&#8221; for further information about the G-SIB surcharge. We published a summary of our annual DFAST results in June 2022. See &#8220;Available Information.&#8221; 

GS Bank USA is required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis and publish a summary of certain results. GS Bank USA published a summary of its annual DFAST results in June 2022. See &#8220;Available Information.&#8221;

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

GSI, GSIB and GSBE also have their own capital planning and stress testing processes, which incorporate internally designed stress tests developed in accordance with the guidelines of their respective regulators. 

Contingency Capital Plan. As part of our comprehensive capital management policy, we maintain a contingency capital plan. Our contingency capital plan provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency, including, but not limited to, identification of drivers of a capital deficiency, as well as mitigants and potential actions. It outlines the appropriate communication procedures to follow during a crisis period, including internal dissemination of information, as well as timely communication with external stakeholders. 

Capital Attribution. We assess each of our businesses&#8217; capital usage based on our internal assessment of risks, which incorporates an attribution of our relevant regulatory capital requirements. These regulatory capital requirements are allocated using our attributed equity framework, which takes into consideration our most binding capital constraints. Our most binding capital constraint is based on the results of the FRB&#8217;s annual stress test, which includes the Standardized risk-based capital and leverage ratios. 

We review and make any necessary adjustments to our attributed equity framework in January each year, to reflect, among other things, the results of our latest CCAR process, as well as projected changes in our balance sheet. On January 1, 2022, our allocation of attributed equity changed (relative to the allocation as of December 2021) as follows: attributed equity increased by approximately $1.0 billion for Consumer &#38; Wealth Management and approximately $0.5 billion for Investment Banking, while attributed equity decreased by approximately $0.8 billion for Global Markets and approximately $0.7 billion for Asset Management. See &#8220;Segment Assets and Operating Results &#8212; Segment Operating Results&#8221; for information about our average quarterly attributed equity by segment. 

Share Repurchase Program. We use our share repurchase program to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. The repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 and accelerated share repurchases), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by our current and projected capital position and our capital plan submitted to the FRB as part of CCAR. The amounts and timing of the repurchases may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock. 

In the third quarter of 2022, the Board of Directors of Group Inc. (Board) approved an increase in our common stock dividend from $2.00 to $2.50 per share. During the third quarter of 2022, we returned a total of $1.89 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1.00 billion and common stock dividends of $893 million. Consistent with our capital management philosophy, we will continue prioritizing deployment of capital for our clients where returns are attractive and return any excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 

As of September 2022, the remaining share authorization under our existing repurchase program was 28.5 million shares. See &#8220;Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds&#8221; in Part II, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q and Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our share repurchase program, and see above for information about our capital planning and stress testing process. 

In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced a one percent non-deductible excise tax on the fair market value of certain corporate share repurchases after December 31, 2022. The fair market value of share repurchases subject to the tax is reduced by the fair market value of any stock issued by the corporation during the calendar year, including stock issued to employees. We are analyzing the impact of the excise tax on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Resolution Capital Models. In connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established a Resolution Capital Adequacy and Positioning framework, which is designed to ensure that our major subsidiaries (GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs &#38; Co. LLC (GS&#38;Co.), GSI, GSIB, GSBE, Goldman Sachs Japan Co., Ltd. (GSJCL), Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. and Goldman Sachs Asset Management International) have access to sufficient loss-absorbing capacity (in the form of equity, subordinated debt and unsecured senior debt) so that they are able to wind down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy. 

In addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the Board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.

Rating Agency Guidelines 

The credit rating agencies assign credit ratings to the obligations of Group Inc., which directly issues or guarantees substantially all of our senior unsecured debt obligations. GS&#38;Co. and GSI have been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings by certain credit rating agencies. GS Bank USA, GSIB and GSBE have also been assigned long- and short-term issuer ratings, as well as ratings on their long- and short-term bank deposits. In addition, credit rating agencies have assigned ratings to debt obligations of certain other subsidiaries of Group Inc. 

The level and composition of our capital are among the many factors considered in determining our credit ratings. Each agency has its own definition of eligible capital and methodology for evaluating capital adequacy, and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors rather than a single calculation. See &#8220;Risk Management &#8212; Liquidity Risk Management &#8212; Credit Ratings&#8221; for further information about credit ratings of Group Inc., GS Bank USA, GSIB, GSBE, GS&#38;Co. and GSI. 

Consolidated Regulatory Capital 

We are subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements which are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). Under the Capital Framework, we are an &#8220;Advanced approaches&#8221; banking organization and have been designated as a G-SIB. 

The capital requirements calculated under the Capital Framework include the capital conservation buffer requirements, which are comprised of a 2.5% buffer (under the Advanced Capital Rules), the SCB (under the Standardized Capital Rules), a countercyclical capital buffer (under both Capital Rules) and the G-SIB surcharge (under both Capital Rules). Our G-SIB surcharge is 2.5% for 2022 and 3.0% for 2023. Based on financial data for 2021 and the nine months ended September 2022, we are above the threshold for the 3.5% G-SIB surcharge. Based on the recent operating environment and our clients&#8217; needs, we are currently targeting to be at the 3.0% G-SIB level as of December 2022 (which would be effective for our January 2024 G-SIB surcharge). Our ability to achieve the 3.0% G-SIB level will depend on the market environment and needs of our clients in the fourth quarter of 2022. We will continue to evaluate this target through the end of 2022. The G-SIB surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer in the future may differ due to additional guidance from our regulators and/or positional changes, and our SCB is likely to change from year to year based on the results of the annual supervisory stress tests. Our target is to maintain capital ratios equal to the regulatory requirements plus a buffer of 50 to 100 basis points. 

See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratios, and the Capital Framework. 

Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) 

We are also subject to the FRB&#8217;s TLAC and related requirements. Failure to comply with the TLAC and related requirements would result in restrictions being imposed by the FRB and could limit our ability to repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments. 

The table below presents TLAC and external long-term debt requirements. 

Requirements TLAC to RWAs 21.5 &#160; % TLAC to leverage exposure 9.5 &#160; % External long-term debt to RWAs 8.5 &#160; % External long-term debt to leverage exposure 4.5 &#160; % 

In the table above: 

&#8226; The TLAC to RWAs requirement included (i) the 18% minimum, (ii) the 2.5% buffer, (iii) the countercyclical capital buffer, which the FRB has set to zero percent and (iv) the 1.0% G-SIB surcharge (Method 1). 

&#8226; The TLAC to leverage exposure requirement includes (i) the 7.5% minimum and (ii) the 2.0% leverage exposure buffer. 

&#8226; The external long-term debt to RWAs requirement includes (i) the 6% minimum and (ii) the 2.5% G-SIB surcharge (Method 2). 

&#8226; The external long-term debt to total leverage exposure is the 4.5% minimum.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

In the table above: 

&#8226; TLAC includes common and preferred stock, and eligible long-term debt issued by Group Inc. Eligible long-term debt represents unsecured debt, which has a remaining maturity of at least one year and satisfies additional requirements. 

&#8226; External long-term debt consists of eligible long-term debt subject to a haircut if it is due to be paid between one and two years. 

&#8226; RWAs represent Standardized RWAs as of both September 2022 and December 2021. In accordance with the TLAC rules, the higher of Advanced or Standardized RWAs are used in the calculation of TLAC and external long-term debt ratios and applicable requirements. 

&#8226; Leverage exposure consists of average adjusted total assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures. 

See &#8220;Business &#8212; Regulation&#8221; in Part I, Item 1 of the 2021 Form 10-K for further information about TLAC. 

Subsidiary Capital Requirements 

Many of our subsidiaries, including our bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, are subject to separate regulation and capital requirements of the jurisdictions in which they operate. 

Bank Subsidiaries. GS Bank USA is our primary U.S. banking subsidiary and GSIB and GSBE are our primary non-U.S. banking subsidiaries. These entities are subject to regulatory capital requirements. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the regulatory capital requirements of our bank subsidiaries. 

U.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries. GS&#38;Co., our primary U.S. regulated broker-dealer subsidiary, is also a registered futures commission merchant and a registered swap dealer with the CFTC, and a registered security-based swap dealer with the SEC, and therefore is subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., the CFTC, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the National Futures Association. Rule 15c3-1 of the SEC and Rules 1.17 and Part 23 Subpart E of the CFTC specify uniform minimum net capital requirements, as defined, for their registrants, and also effectively require that a significant part of the registrants&#8217; assets be kept in relatively liquid form. GS&#38;Co. has elected to calculate its minimum capital requirements in accordance with the &#8220;Alternative Net Capital Requirement&#8221; as permitted by Rule 15c3-1 of the SEC. 

GS&#38;Co. had regulatory net capital, as defined by Rule 15c3-1, of $21.44 billion as of September 2022 and $22.18 billion as of December 2021, which exceeded the amount required by $16.61 billion as of September 2022 and $17.74 billion as of December 2021. In addition to its alternative minimum net capital requirements, GS&#38;Co. is also required to hold tentative net capital in excess of $5 billion and net capital in excess of $1 billion in accordance with Rule 15c3-1. GS&#38;Co. is also required to notify the SEC in the event that its tentative net capital is less than $6 billion. As of both September 2022 and December 2021, GS&#38;Co. had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of both the minimum and the notification requirements. 

Non-U.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries. Our principal non-U.S. regulated broker-dealer subsidiaries include GSI and GSJCL. 

GSI, our U.K. broker-dealer, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). GSI is subject to the U.K. capital framework, which is largely based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision&#8217;s (Basel Committee) capital framework for strengthening international capital standards (Basel III). 

The table below presents GSI&#8217;s risk-based capital requirements. 

As of September December 2022 2021 Risk-based capital requirements CET1 capital ratio 8.4 &#160; % 8.1 % Tier 1 capital ratio 10.4 &#160; % 9.9 % Total capital ratio 13.0 &#160; % 12.4 % 

In the table above, the risk-based capital requirements incorporate capital guidance received from the PRA and could change in the future.

Risk-based capital ratios 

CET1 capital ratio 11.7% 10.7% Tier 1 capital ratio 14.8% 13.8% Total capital ratio 16.8% 15.7% 

In the table above, the risk-based capital ratios as of September 2022 reflected profits after foreseeable charges that are still subject to verification by GSI&#8217;s external auditors and approval by the PRA for inclusion in risk-based capital. These profits contributed approximately 27 basis points to the CET1 capital ratio as of September 2022. 

GSI is also subject to the leverage ratio framework established by the PRA. This framework sets a minimum leverage ratio requirement at 3.25% that will apply to GSI from January 1, 2023. GSI had a leverage ratio of 5.4% as of September 2022 and 4.2% as of December 2021. The leverage ratio as of September 2022 reflected profits after foreseeable charges that are still subject to verification by GSI&#8217;s external auditors and approval by the PRA for inclusion in risk-based capital. These profits contributed approximately 10 basis points to the leverage ratio as of September 2022. 

GSI is a registered swap dealer with the CFTC and a registered security-based swap dealer with the SEC. As of both September 2022 and December 2021, GSI was subject to and in compliance with applicable capital requirements for swap dealers and security-based swap dealers. 

GSI is also subject to a minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities issued to affiliates. This requirement is subject to a transitional period which began to phase in from January 2019 and became fully effective beginning in January 2022. As of both September 2022 and December 2021, GSI was in compliance with this requirement. 

GSJCL, our Japanese broker-dealer, is regulated by Japan&#8217;s Financial Services Agency. GSJCL and certain other non-U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to capital requirements promulgated by authorities of the countries in which they operate. As of both September 2022 and December 2021, these subsidiaries were in compliance with their local capital requirements. 

Regulatory and Other Matters 

Regulatory Matters 

Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and supervision worldwide. Regulations have been adopted or are being considered by regulators and policy makers worldwide. Given that many of the new and proposed rules are highly complex, the full impact of regulatory reform will not be known until the rules are implemented and market practices develop under the final regulations. 

See &#8220;Business &#8212; Regulation&#8221; in Part I, Item 1 of the 2021 Form 10-K for further information about the laws, rules and regulations and proposed laws, rules and regulations that apply to us and our operations. 

Other Matters 

Replacement of Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs), including LIBOR. On January 1, 2022, the publication of all EUR, CHF, JPY and GBP LIBOR (non-USD LIBOR) settings along with certain USD LIBOR settings ceased. The publication of the most commonly used USD LIBOR settings will cease after June 2023. The FCA has allowed the publication and use of synthetic rates for certain GBP and JPY LIBOR settings in legacy GBP or JPY LIBOR-based derivative contracts through December 2022. The U.S. federal banking agencies&#8217; guidance strongly encourages banking organizations to cease using USD LIBOR. 

The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (IBOR Protocol) has provided derivatives market participants with amended fallbacks for legacy and new derivative contracts to mitigate legal or economic uncertainty. Both counterparties have to adhere to the IBOR Protocol or engage in bilateral amendments for the terms to be effective for derivative contracts. ISDA has confirmed that the FCA&#8217;s formal announcement to cease both non-USD and USD LIBOR settings fixed the spread adjustment for all LIBOR rates and as a result fallbacks applied automatically for non-USD LIBOR settings following December 31, 2021 and will apply automatically for USD LIBOR settings following June 30, 2023. The Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, that was enacted in March 2022, provides a statutory framework to replace USD LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) for contracts governed by U.S. law that have no fallbacks or fallbacks that would require the use of a poll or LIBOR-based rate. Under the LIBOR Act, the FRB must adopt rules to identify the applicable SOFR-based replacement rate. In July 2022, the FRB released proposed rules, which would identify different SOFR-based replacement rates for derivative contracts, for cash instruments such as floating-rate notes and preferred stock, for consumer contracts and for certain government-sponsored enterprise contracts. The FRB has not yet adopted these rules. 

Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form 10-Q 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

We facilitated an orderly transition from non-USD LIBORs to alternative risk-free reference rates and synthetic rates for us and our clients, and continue to make progress on our transition program as it relates to USD LIBOR. 

Our risk exposure to USD LIBOR is primarily in connection with our derivative contracts and, to a lesser extent, our unsecured debt, preferred stock and loan portfolio. As of September 2022, the notional amount of our USD LIBOR-based derivative contracts was approximately $7 trillion, of which approximately $5 trillion will mature after June 2023 based on their contractual terms. Substantially all of such derivative contracts are with counterparties under bilateral agreements subject to the IBOR Protocol, or with central clearing counterparties or exchanges which have incorporated fallbacks consistent with the IBOR Protocol in their rulebooks and have announced that they plan to convert USD LIBOR contracts to alternative risk-free reference rates. Our benchmark unsecured debt and preferred stock with USD LIBOR exposure was approximately $29.0 billion as of September 2022, of which $26.4 billion will contractually mature after June 2023 or is perpetual and has no stated maturity date. We continue to monitor industry and legislative developments as they relate to unsecured debt and preferred stock and will take actions designed to facilitate an orderly transition. In addition, we are also engaging with our clients in order to remediate our loan agreements through bilateral amendments. 

We have also issued debt and deposits linked to SOFR and Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) and executed SOFR- and SONIA-based derivative contracts to make markets and facilitate client activities. When appropriate, we continue to execute transactions in the market to reduce our USD LIBOR exposures arising from hedges to our fixed-rate debt issuances and replace them with alternative risk-free reference rate exposures. See &#8220;Regulatory and Other Matters &#8212; Other Matters&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the 2021 Form 10-K for further information about our transition program. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into various types of off-balance sheet arrangements. Our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including: 

&#8226; Purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in special purpose entities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization vehicles; 

&#8226; Holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships, and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles; 

&#8226; Entering into interest rate, foreign currency, equity, commodity and credit derivatives, including total return swaps; and 

&#8226; Providing guarantees, indemnifications, commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties. 

We enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes, including securitizations. The securitization vehicles that purchase mortgages, corporate bonds and other types of financial assets are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets, including the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities markets, since they offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. 

We also enter into these arrangements to underwrite client securitization transactions; provide secondary market liquidity; make investments in performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans, power-related assets, equity securities, real estate and other assets; and provide investors with credit-linked and asset-repackaged notes. 

The table below presents where information about our various off-balance sheet arrangements may be found in this Form 10-Q. In addition, see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for information about our consolidation policies.

Risk Management 

Risks are inherent in our businesses and include liquidity, market, credit, operational, model, legal, compliance, conduct, regulatory and reputational risks. Our risks include the risks across our risk categories, regions or global businesses, as well as those which have uncertain outcomes and have the potential to materially impact our financial results, our liquidity and our reputation. For further information about our risk management processes, see &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management,&#8221; and for information about our areas of risk, see &#8220;Liquidity Risk Management,&#8221; &#8220;Market Risk Management,&#8221; &#8220;Credit Risk Management,&#8221; &#8220;Operational Risk Management,&#8221; &#8220;Model Risk Management&#8221; and &#8220;Other Risk Management,&#8221; as well as &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K. 

Overview and Structure of Risk Management 

Overview 

We believe that effective risk management is critical to our success. Accordingly, we have established an enterprise risk management framework that employs a comprehensive, integrated approach to risk management, and is designed to enable comprehensive risk management processes through which we identify, assess, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our activities. Our risk management structure is built around three core components: governance, processes and people. 

Governance. Risk management governance starts with the Board, which both directly and through its committees, including its Risk Committee, oversees our risk management policies and practices implemented through the enterprise risk management framework. The Board is also responsible for the annual review and approval of our risk appetite statement. The risk appetite statement describes the levels and types of risk we are willing to accept or to avoid, in order to achieve our objectives included in our strategic business plan, while remaining in compliance with regulatory requirements. The Board reviews our strategic business plan and is ultimately responsible for overseeing and providing direction about our strategy and risk appetite. 

The Board receives regular briefings on firmwide risks, including liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk, operational risk and model risk, from our independent risk oversight and control functions, including the chief risk officer, and on compliance risk and conduct risk from Compliance, on legal and regulatory enforcement matters from the chief legal officer, and on other matters impacting our reputation from the chair of our Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee and our Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee. The chief risk officer reports to our chief executive officer and to the Risk Committee of the Board. As part of the review of the firmwide risk portfolio, the chief risk officer regularly advises the Risk Committee of the Board of relevant risk metrics and material exposures, including risk limits and thresholds established in our risk appetite statement. 

The implementation of our risk governance structure and core risk management processes is overseen by Enterprise Risk, which reports to our chief risk officer, and is responsible for ensuring that our enterprise risk management framework provides the Board, our risk committees and senior management with a consistent and integrated approach to managing our various risks in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. 

Our revenue-producing units, as well as Treasury, Engineering, Human Capital Management, Operations, and Corporate and Workplace Solutions, are considered our first line of defense. They are accountable for the outcomes of our risk-generating activities, as well as for assessing and managing those risks within our risk appetite. 

Our independent risk oversight and control functions are considered our second line of defense and provide independent assessment, oversight and challenge of the risks taken by our first line of defense, as well as lead and participate in risk committees. Independent risk oversight and control functions include Compliance, Conflicts Resolution, Controllers, Legal, Risk and Tax. 

Internal Audit is considered our third line of defense, and our director of Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee of the Board and administratively to our chief executive officer. Internal Audit includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise. Internal Audit is responsible for independently assessing and validating the effectiveness of key controls, including those within the risk management framework, and providing timely reporting to the Audit Committee of the Board, senior management and regulators. 

Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form 10-Q 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

The three lines of defense structure promotes the accountability of first line risk takers, provides a framework for effective challenge by the second line and empowers independent review from the third line. 

Processes. We maintain various processes that are critical components of our risk management framework, including (i) risk identification and assessment, (ii) risk appetite, limit and threshold setting, (iii) risk reporting and monitoring, and (iv) risk decision-making. 

&#8226; Risk Identification and Assessment. We believe that the identification and assessment of our risks is a critical step in providing our Board and senior management transparency and insight into the range and materiality of our risks. We have a comprehensive data collection process, including firmwide policies and procedures that require all employees to report and escalate risk events. Our approach for risk identification and assessment is comprehensive across all risk types, is dynamic and forward-looking to reflect and adapt to our changing risk profile and business environment, leverages subject matter expertise, and allows for prioritization of our most critical risks. 

To effectively assess our risks, we maintain a daily discipline of marking substantially all of our inventory to current market levels. We carry our inventory at fair value, with changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk management systems and in net revenues. We do so because we believe this discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and managing risk and that it provides transparent and realistic insight into our inventory exposures. 

An important part of our risk management process is firmwide stress testing. It allows us to quantify our exposure to tail risks, highlight potential loss concentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and mitigate our risk positions. Firmwide stress tests are performed on a regular basis and are designed to ensure a comprehensive analysis of our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks combining financial and nonfinancial risks, including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity and funding, operational and compliance, strategic, systemic and emerging risks into a single combined scenario. We also perform ad hoc stress tests in anticipation of market events or conditions. Stress tests are also used to assess capital adequacy as part of our capital planning and stress testing process. See &#8220;Capital Management and Regulatory Capital &#8212; Capital Management&#8221; for further information. 

&#8226; Risk Appetite, Limit and Threshold Setting. We apply a rigorous framework of limits and thresholds to control and monitor risk across transactions, products, businesses and markets. The Board, directly or indirectly through its Risk Committee, approves limits and thresholds included in our risk appetite statement at firmwide, business and product levels. In addition, the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee is responsible for approving our risk limits framework, subject to the overall limits approved by the Risk Committee of the Board, and monitoring these limits. 

The Risk Governance Committee is responsible for approving limits at firmwide, business and product levels. Certain limits may be set at levels that will require periodic adjustment, rather than at levels that reflect our maximum risk appetite. This fosters an ongoing dialogue about risk among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management, as well as rapid escalation of risk-related matters. Additionally, through delegated authority from the Risk Governance Committee, Market Risk sets limits at certain product and desk levels, and Credit Risk sets limits for individual counterparties, counterparties and their subsidiaries, industries and countries. Limits are reviewed regularly and amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect changing market conditions, business conditions or risk tolerance. 

&#8226; Risk Reporting and Monitoring. Effective risk reporting and risk decision-making depends on our ability to get the right information to the right people at the right time. As such, we focus on the rigor and effectiveness of our risk systems, with the objective of ensuring that our risk management technology systems provide us with complete, accurate and timely information. Our risk reporting and monitoring processes are designed to take into account information about both existing and emerging risks, thereby enabling our risk committees and senior management to perform their responsibilities with the appropriate level of insight into risk exposures. Furthermore, our limit and threshold breach processes provide means for timely escalation. We evaluate changes in our risk profile and our businesses, including changes in business mix or jurisdictions in which we operate, by monitoring risk factors at a firmwide level. 

Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form 10-Q 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

&#8226; Risk Decision-Making. Our governance structure provides the protocol and responsibility for decision-making on risk management issues and ensures implementation of those decisions. We make extensive use of risk committees that meet regularly and serve as an important means to facilitate and foster ongoing discussions to manage and mitigate risks. 

We maintain strong and proactive communication about risk and we have a culture of collaboration in decision-making among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management. While our first line of defense is responsible for management of their risk, we dedicate extensive resources to our second line of defense in order to ensure a strong oversight structure and an appropriate segregation of duties. We regularly reinforce our strong culture of escalation and accountability across all functions. 

People. Even the best technology serves only as a tool for helping to make informed decisions in real time about the risks we are taking. Ultimately, effective risk management requires our people to interpret our risk data on an ongoing and timely basis and adjust risk positions accordingly. The experience of our professionals, and their understanding of the nuances and limitations of each risk measure, guides us in assessing exposures and maintaining them within prudent levels. 

We reinforce a culture of effective risk management, consistent with our risk appetite, in our training and development programs, as well as in the way we evaluate performance, and recognize and reward our people. Our training and development programs, including certain sessions led by our most senior leaders, are focused on the importance of risk management, client relationships and reputational excellence. As part of our performance review process, we assess reputational excellence, including how an employee exercises good risk management and reputational judgment, and adheres to our code of conduct and compliance policies. Our review and reward processes are designed to communicate and reinforce to our professionals the link between behavior and how people are recognized, the need to focus on our clients and our reputation, and the need to always act in accordance with our highest standards. 

Structure 

Ultimate oversight of risk is the responsibility of our Board. The Board oversees risk both directly and through its committees, including its Risk Committee. We also have a series of committees with specific risk management mandates that have oversight or decision-making responsibilities for risk management activities. Committee membership generally consists of senior managers from both our first and second lines of defense. We have established procedures for these committees to ensure that appropriate information barriers are in place. Our primary risk committees, most of which also have additional sub-committees, councils or working groups, are described below. In addition to these committees, we have other risk committees that provide oversight for different businesses, activities, products, regions and entities. All of our committees have responsibility for considering the impact on our reputation of the transactions and activities that they oversee. 

Membership of our risk committees is reviewed regularly and updated to reflect changes in the responsibilities of the committee members. Accordingly, the length of time that members serve on the respective committees varies as determined by the committee chairs and based on the responsibilities of the members. 

The chart below presents an overview of our risk management governance structure. 

Management Committee. The Management Committee oversees our global activities. It provides this oversight directly and through authority delegated to committees it has established. This committee consists of our most senior leaders, and is chaired by our chief executive officer. Most members of the Management Committee are also members of other committees. The following are the committees that are principally involved in firmwide risk management.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee. The Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing all of our financial and nonfinancial risks. As part of such oversight, the committee is responsible for the ongoing review, approval and monitoring of our enterprise risk management framework, as well as our risk limits framework. This committee, which reports to the Management Committee, is co-chaired by our president and chief operating officer and our chief risk officer, who are appointed as chairs by our chief executive officer, and the vice-chair is our chief financial officer, who is appointed as vice-chair by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee. The following are the primary committees or councils that report to the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee: 

&#8226; Firmwide Risk Council. The Firmwide Risk Council is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of relevant financial risks and related risk limits at the firmwide, business and product levels. This council is co-chaired by our chief financial officer and our chief risk officer.

Liquidity Risk Management 

Overview 

Liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to fund ourselves or meet our liquidity needs in the event of firm-specific, broader industry or market liquidity stress events. We have in place a comprehensive and conservative set of liquidity and funding policies. Our principal objective is to be able to fund ourselves and to enable our core businesses to continue to serve clients and generate revenues, even under adverse circumstances. 

Treasury, which reports to our chief financial officer, has primary responsibility for developing, managing and executing our liquidity and funding strategy within our risk appetite. 

Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form 10-Q 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Liquidity Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and Treasury, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our liquidity risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses and the establishment of stress testing and limits frameworks. 

Liquidity Risk Management Principles 

We manage liquidity risk according to three principles: (i) hold sufficient excess liquidity in the form of GCLA to cover outflows during a stressed period, (ii) maintain appropriate Asset-Liability Management and (iii) maintain a viable Contingency Funding Plan. 

GCLA. GCLA is liquidity that we maintain to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment. A primary liquidity principle is to pre-fund our estimated potential cash and collateral needs during a liquidity crisis and hold this liquidity in the form of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. We believe that the securities held in our GCLA would be readily convertible to cash in a matter of days, through liquidation, by entering into repurchase agreements or from maturities of resale agreements, and that this cash would allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit-sensitive markets. 

Our GCLA reflects the following principles: 

&#8226; The first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a company&#8217;s survival; 

&#8226; Focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows, not just disruptions to financing flows. Our businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment; 

&#8226; During a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt, certain deposits and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change and certain deposits may be withdrawn; and 

&#8226; As a result of our policy to pre-fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis, we hold more unencumbered securities and have larger funding balances than our businesses would otherwise require. We believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities, even though it increases our total assets and our funding costs. 

We maintain our GCLA across Group Inc., Goldman Sachs Funding LLC (Funding IHC) and Group Inc.&#8217;s major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, asset types and clearing agents to provide us with sufficient operating liquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets, even in a difficult funding environment. In addition to the GCLA, we maintain cash balances and securities in several of our other entities, primarily for use in specific currencies, entities or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity. 

Asset-Liability Management. Our liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we have a sufficient amount of financing, even when funding markets experience persistent stress. We manage the maturities and diversity of our funding across markets, products and counterparties, and seek to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets. 

Our approach to asset-liability management includes: 

&#8226; Conservatively managing the overall characteristics of our funding book, with a focus on maintaining long-term, diversified sources of funding in excess of our current requirements. See &#8220;Balance Sheet and Funding Sources &#8212; Funding Sources&#8221; for further information; 

&#8226; Actively managing and monitoring our asset base, with particular focus on the liquidity, holding period and ability to fund assets on a secured basis. We assess our funding requirements and our ability to liquidate assets in a stressed environment while appropriately managing risk. This enables us to determine the most appropriate funding products and tenors. See &#8220;Balance Sheet and Funding Sources &#8212; Balance Sheet Management&#8221; for further information about our balance sheet management process and &#8220;&#8212; Funding Sources &#8212; Secured Funding&#8221; for further information about asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis; and 

&#8226; Raising secured and unsecured financing that has a long tenor relative to the liquidity profile of our assets. This reduces the risk that our liabilities will come due in advance of our ability to generate liquidity from the sale of our assets. Because we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet, the holding period of certain of our assets may be materially shorter than their contractual maturity dates. 

Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form 10-Q 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Our goal is to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our assets and meet our contractual and contingent obligations in normal times, as well as during periods of market stress. Through our dynamic balance sheet management process, we use actual and projected asset balances to determine secured and unsecured funding requirements. Funding plans are reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee. In addition, our independent risk oversight and control functions analyze, and the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee reviews, our consolidated total capital position (unsecured long-term borrowings plus total shareholders&#8217; equity) so that we maintain a level of long-term funding that is sufficient to meet our long-term financing requirements. In a liquidity crisis, we would first use our GCLA in order to avoid reliance on asset sales (other than our GCLA). However, we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis. 

Subsidiary Funding Policies 

The majority of our unsecured funding is raised by Group Inc., which provides the necessary funds to Funding IHC and other subsidiaries, some of which are regulated, to meet their asset financing, liquidity and capital requirements. In addition, Group Inc. provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements. The benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding are enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries. Funding is also raised at the subsidiary level through a variety of products, including deposits, secured funding and unsecured borrowings. 

Our intercompany funding policies assume that a subsidiary&#8217;s funds or securities are not freely available to its parent, Funding IHC or other subsidiaries unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In particular, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc. or Funding IHC. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations. Accordingly, we assume that the capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or other subsidiaries and any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC until the maturity of such financing. 

Group Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to its regulated subsidiaries. For example, as of September 2022, Group Inc. had $38.27 billion of equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in GS&#38;Co., its principal U.S. registered broker-dealer; $48.29 billion invested in GSI, a regulated U.K. broker-dealer; $2.53 billion invested in GSJCL, a regulated Japanese broker-dealer; $51.51 billion invested in GS Bank USA, a regulated New York State-chartered bank; and $4.21 billion invested in GSIB, a regulated U.K. bank. Group Inc. also provides financing, directly or indirectly, in the form of: $97.56 billion of unsubordinated loans (including secured loans of $46.10 billion) and $35.35 billion of collateral and cash deposits to these entities as of September 2022. In addition, as of September 2022, Group Inc. had significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries. 

Contingency Funding Plan. We maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress. Our contingency funding plan outlines a list of potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation. The contingency funding plan also describes in detail our potential responses if our assessments indicate that we have entered a liquidity crisis, which include pre-funding for what we estimate will be our potential cash and collateral needs, as well as utilizing secondary sources of liquidity. Mitigants and action items to address specific risks which may arise are also described and assigned to individuals responsible for execution. 

The contingency funding plan identifies key groups of individuals and their responsibilities, which include fostering effective coordination, control and distribution of information, implementing liquidity maintenance activities and managing internal and external communication, all of which are critical in the management of a crisis or period of market stress.

Stress Tests 

In order to determine the appropriate size of our GCLA, we model liquidity outflows over a range of scenarios and time horizons. One of our primary internal liquidity risk models, referred to as the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, quantifies our liquidity risks over a 30-day stress scenario. We also consider other factors, including, but not limited to, an assessment of our potential intraday liquidity needs through an additional internal liquidity risk model, referred to as the Intraday Liquidity Model, the results of our long-term stress testing models, our resolution liquidity models and other applicable regulatory requirements and a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets. The results of the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, the Intraday Liquidity Model, the long-term stress testing models and the resolution liquidity models are reported to senior management on a regular basis. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management&#8221; for information about firmwide stress tests. 

Modeled Liquidity Outflow. Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow is based on conducting multiple scenarios that include combinations of market-wide and firm-specific stress. These scenarios are characterized by the following qualitative elements: 

&#8226; Severely challenged market environments, which include low consumer and corporate confidence, financial and political instability, and adverse changes in market values, including potential declines in equity markets and widening of credit spreads; and 

&#8226; A firm-specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses, reputational damage, litigation and/or a ratings downgrade. 

The following are key modeling elements of our Modeled Liquidity Outflow: 

&#8226; Liquidity needs over a 30-day scenario; 

&#8226; A two-notch downgrade of our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings; 

&#8226; Changing conditions in funding markets, which limit our access to unsecured and secured funding; 

&#8226; No support from additional government funding facilities. Although we have access to various central bank funding programs, we do not assume reliance on additional sources of funding in a liquidity crisis; and 

&#8226; A combination of contractual outflows and contingent outflows arising from both our on- and off-balance sheet arrangements. Contractual outflows include, among other things, upcoming maturities of unsecured debt, term deposits and secured funding. Contingent outflows include, among other things, the withdrawal of customer credit balances in our prime brokerage business, increase in variation margin requirements due to adverse changes in the value of our exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives, draws on unfunded commitments and withdrawals of deposits that have no contractual maturity. See notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about contractual outflows, including Note 11 for collateralized financings, Note 13 for deposits, Note 14 for unsecured long-term borrowings and Note 15 for operating lease payments, and &#8220;Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements&#8221; for further information about our various types of off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Intraday Liquidity Model. Our Intraday Liquidity Model measures our intraday liquidity needs using a scenario analysis characterized by the same qualitative elements as our Modeled Liquidity Outflow. The model assesses the risk of increased intraday liquidity requirements during a scenario where access to sources of intraday liquidity may become constrained. 

Long-Term Stress Testing. We utilize longer-term stress tests to take a forward view on our liquidity position through prolonged stress periods in which we experience a severe liquidity stress and recover in an environment that continues to be challenging. We are focused on ensuring conservative asset-liability management to prepare for a prolonged period of potential stress, seeking to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets. 

Resolution Liquidity Models. In connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established our Resolution Liquidity Adequacy and Positioning framework, which estimates liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries in a stressed environment. The liquidity needs are measured using our Modeled Liquidity Outflow assumptions and include certain additional inter-affiliate exposures. We have also established our Resolution Liquidity Execution Need framework, which measures the liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries to stabilize and wind down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy. 

In addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the Board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc.

Limits 

We use liquidity risk limits at various levels and across liquidity risk types to manage the size of our liquidity exposures. Limits are measured relative to acceptable levels of risk given our liquidity risk tolerance. See &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management&#8221; for information about the limit approval process. 

Limits are monitored by Treasury and Liquidity Risk. Liquidity Risk is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded. 

GCLA and Unencumbered Metrics 

GCLA. Based on the results of our internal liquidity risk models, described above, as well as our consideration of other factors, including, but not limited to, a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets, we believe our liquidity position as of both September 2022 and December 2021 was appropriate. We strictly limit our GCLA to a narrowly defined list of securities and cash because they are highly liquid, even in a difficult funding environment. We do not include other potential sources of excess liquidity in our GCLA, such as less liquid unencumbered securities or committed credit facilities. 

The table below presents information about our GCLA. 

Average for the Three Months Ended September June $ in millions 2022 2022 Denomination U.S. dollar $ 295,985 &#160; $ 270,121 Non-U.S. dollar 120,937 &#160; 121,146 Total $ 416,922 &#160; $ 391,267

In the table above: 

&#8226; The U.S. dollar-denominated GCLA consists of (i) unencumbered U.S. government and agency obligations (including highly liquid U.S. agency mortgage-backed obligations), all of which are eligible as collateral in Federal Reserve open market operations and (ii) certain overnight U.S. dollar cash deposits. 

&#8226; The non-U.S. dollar-denominated GCLA consists of non-U.S. government obligations (only unencumbered German, French, Japanese and U.K. government obligations) and certain overnight cash deposits in highly liquid currencies. 

We maintain our GCLA to enable us to meet current and potential liquidity requirements of our parent company, Group Inc., and its subsidiaries. Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model incorporate a requirement for Group Inc., as well as a standalone requirement for each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries. Funding IHC is required to provide the necessary liquidity to Group Inc. during the ordinary course of business, and is also obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to major subsidiaries in the event of our material financial distress or failure. Liquidity held directly in each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries is intended for use only by that subsidiary to meet its liquidity requirements and is assumed not to be available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In addition, the Modeled Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model also incorporate a broader assessment of standalone liquidity requirements for other subsidiaries and we hold a portion of our GCLA directly at Group Inc. or Funding IHC to support such requirements. 

Other Unencumbered Assets. In addition to our GCLA, we have a significant amount of other unencumbered cash and financial instruments, including other government obligations, high-grade money market securities, corporate obligations, marginable equities, loans and cash deposits not included in our GCLA. The fair value of our unencumbered assets averaged $269.71 billion for the three months ended September 2022 and $279.07 billion for the three months ended June 2022. We do not consider these assets liquid enough to be eligible for our GCLA. 

Liquidity Regulatory Framework 

As a BHC, we are subject to a minimum Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) under the LCR rule approved by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. The LCR rule requires organizations to maintain an adequate ratio of eligible high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to expected net cash outflows under an acute, short-term liquidity stress scenario. Eligible HQLA excludes HQLA held by subsidiaries that is in excess of their minimum requirement and is subject to transfer restrictions. We are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. We expect that fluctuations in client activity, business mix and the market environment will impact our LCR. 

The table below presents information about our average daily LCR. 

Average for the Three Months Ended September June $ in millions 2022 2022 Total HQLA $ 407,969 &#160; $ 380,531 Eligible HQLA $ 279,121 &#160; $ 261,718 Net cash outflows $ 224,408 &#160; $ 209,577

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

As a BHC, we are subject to a net stable funding ratio (NSFR) requirement established by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies, which requires large U.S. banking organizations to ensure they have access to stable funding over a one-year time horizon. The rule also requires disclosure of the ratio on a semi-annual basis and a description of the banking organization&#8217;s stable funding sources beginning in 2023. Our NSFR as of September 2022 exceeded the minimum requirement. 

The following provides information about our subsidiary liquidity regulatory requirements: 

&#8226; GS Bank USA. GS Bank USA is subject to a minimum LCR of 100% under the LCR rule approved by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. As of September 2022, GS Bank USA&#8217;s LCR exceeded the minimum requirement. The NSFR requirement described above also applies to GS Bank USA. As of September 2022, GS Bank USA&#8217;s NSFR exceeded the minimum requirement. 

&#8226; GSI and GSIB. GSI and GSIB are subject to a minimum LCR of 100% under the LCR rule approved by the U.K. regulatory authorities. GSI&#8217;s and GSIB&#8217;s average monthly LCR for the trailing twelve-month period ended September 2022 exceeded the minimum requirement. GSI and GSIB are subject to the applicable NSFR requirement in the U.K., which became effective in January 2022. As of September 2022, both GSI&#8217;s and GSIB&#8217;s NSFR exceeded the minimum requirement. 

&#8226; GSBE. GSBE is subject to a minimum LCR of 100% under the LCR rule approved by the European Parliament and Council. GSBE&#8217;s average monthly LCR for the trailing twelve-month period ended September 2022 exceeded the minimum requirement. GSBE is subject to the applicable NSFR requirement in the E.U. As of September 2022, GSBE&#8217;s NSFR exceeded the minimum requirement. 

&#8226; Other Subsidiaries. We monitor local regulatory liquidity requirements of our subsidiaries to ensure compliance. For many of our subsidiaries, these requirements either have changed or are likely to change in the future due to the implementation of the Basel Committee&#8217;s framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring, as well as other regulatory developments. 

The implementation of these rules and any amendments adopted by the regulatory authorities could impact our liquidity and funding requirements and practices in the future. 

Credit Ratings 

We rely on the short- and long-term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our day-to-day operations and the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. Credit ratings are also important when we are competing in certain markets, such as OTC derivatives, and when we seek to engage in longer-term transactions. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K for information about the risks associated with a reduction in our credit ratings. 

The table below presents the unsecured credit ratings and outlook of Group Inc.

We believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating agencies&#8217; assessment of: 

&#8226; Our liquidity, market, credit and operational risk management practices; 

&#8226; Our level and variability of earnings; 

&#8226; Our capital base; 

&#8226; Our franchise, reputation and management; 

&#8226; Our corporate governance; and 

&#8226; The external operating and economic environment, including, in some cases, the assumed level of government support or other systemic considerations, such as potential resolution. 

Certain of our derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. We manage our GCLA to ensure we would, among other potential requirements, be able to make the additional collateral or termination payments that may be required in the event of a two-notch reduction in our long-term credit ratings, as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties, but is available to them. 

See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about derivatives with credit-related contingent features and the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a one- or two-notch downgrade in our credit ratings. 

Cash Flows 

As a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets. Consequently, we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the liquidity and asset-liability management policies described above. Cash flow analysis may, however, be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our businesses. 

Nine Months Ended September 2022 . Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $23.22 billion to $284.25 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2022, due to net cash provided by financing and operating activities, partially offset by net cash used for investing activities. The net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected cash inflows from deposits (reflecting increases in transaction banking, deposit sweep program balances, brokered certificates of deposit, and consumer deposits, partially offset by a decrease in other deposits) and net issuance of unsecured long-term borrowings. The net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflected cash inflows from trading liabilities and customer and other receivables and payables, net (reflecting both an increase in customer and other payables and in customer and other receivables), partially offset by cash outflows from trading assets. The net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected purchases of investments (primarily U.S. government obligations accounted for as held-to-maturity) and an increase in net lending activities (reflecting increases in corporate, consumer and wealth management loans). 

Nine Months Ended September 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $55.99 billion to $211.83 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2021, due to net cash provided by financing activities, partially offset by net cash used for operating activities and investing activities. The net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected an increase in net deposits (principally reflecting increases in institutional, transaction banking, private bank, consumer and deposit sweep program balances) and net issuance of unsecured long-term borrowings. The net cash used for operating activities primarily reflected an increase in collateralized transactions (an increase in collateralized agreements, partially offset by an increase in collateralized financings), partially offset by an increase in trading liabilities. The net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected purchases of investments and an increase in net lending activities, partially offset by sales and paydowns of investments.

Market Risk Management 

Overview 

Market risk is the risk of loss in the value of our inventory, investments, loans and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value due to changes in market conditions. We hold such positions primarily for market making for our clients and for our investing and financing activities, and therefore, these positions change based on client demands and our investment opportunities. Since these positions are accounted for at fair value, they fluctuate on a daily basis, with the related gains and losses included in the consolidated statements of earnings. We employ a variety of risk measures, each described in the respective sections below, to monitor market risk. Categories of market risk include the following: 

&#8226; Interest rate risk: results from exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of yield curves, the volatilities of interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit spreads; 

&#8226; Equity price risk: results from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities, baskets of equities and equity indices; 

&#8226; Currency rate risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates; and 

&#8226; Commodity price risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals. 

Market Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our market risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses. 

Managers in revenue-producing units and Market Risk discuss market information, positions and estimated loss scenarios on an ongoing basis. Managers in revenue-producing units are accountable for managing risk within prescribed limits. These managers have in-depth knowledge of their positions, markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures. 

Market Risk Management Process 

Our process for managing market risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management,&#8221; as well as the following: 

&#8226; Monitoring compliance with established market risk limits and reporting our exposures; 

&#8226; Diversifying exposures; 

&#8226; Controlling position sizes; and 

&#8226; Evaluating mitigants, such as economic hedges in related securities or derivatives. 

Our market risk management systems enable us to perform an independent calculation of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and stress measures, capture risk measures at individual position levels, attribute risk measures to individual risk factors of each position, report many different views of the risk measures (e.g., by desk, business, product type or entity) and produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner. 

Risk Measures 

We produce risk measures and monitor them against established market risk limits. These measures reflect an extensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregated at product, business and firmwide levels. 

We use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses for both moderate and more extreme market moves over both short- and long-term time horizons. Our primary risk measures are VaR, which is used for shorter-term periods, and stress tests. Our risk reports detail key risks, drivers and changes for each desk and business, and are distributed daily to senior management of both our revenue-producing units and our independent risk oversight and control functions. 

Value-at-Risk. VaR is the potential loss in value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. For assets and liabilities included in VaR, see &#8220;Financial Statement Linkages to Market Risk Measures.&#8221; We typically employ a one-day time horizon with a 95% confidence level. We use a single VaR model, which captures risks, including interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. As such, VaR facilitates comparison across portfolios of different risk characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

We are aware of the inherent limitations to VaR and therefore use a variety of risk measures in our market risk management process. Inherent limitations to VaR include: 

&#8226; VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time horizons where moves may be extreme; 

&#8226; VaR does not take account of the relative liquidity of different risk positions; and 

&#8226; Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of all future market moves. 

To comprehensively capture our exposures and relevant risks in our VaR calculation, we use historical simulations with full valuation of market factors at the position level by simultaneously shocking the relevant market factors for that position. These market factors include spot prices, credit spreads, funding spreads, yield curves, volatility and correlation, and are updated periodically based on changes in the composition of positions, as well as variations in market conditions. We sample from five years of historical data to generate the scenarios for our VaR calculation. The historical data is weighted so that the relative importance of the data reduces over time. This gives greater importance to more recent observations and reflects current asset volatilities, which improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential loss. As a result, even if our positions included in VaR were unchanged, our VaR would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa. 

Given its reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. 

Our VaR measure does not include: 

&#8226; Positions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity measures; and 

&#8226; The impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. 

We perform daily backtesting of our VaR model (i.e., comparing daily net revenues for positions included in VaR to the VaR measure calculated as of the prior business day) at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major regulated subsidiaries. 

Stress Testing. Stress testing is a method of determining the effect of various hypothetical stress scenarios. We use stress testing to examine risks of specific portfolios, as well as the potential impact of our significant risk exposures. We use a variety of stress testing techniques to calculate the potential loss from a wide range of market moves on our portfolios, including firmwide stress tests, sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. The results of our various stress tests are analyzed together for risk management purposes. See &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management&#8221; for information about firmwide stress tests. 

Sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a market move in a single risk factor across all positions (e.g., equity prices or credit spreads) using a variety of defined market shocks, ranging from those that could be expected over a one-day time horizon up to those that could take many months to occur. We also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the default of any single entity, which captures the risk of large or concentrated exposures. 

Scenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of a specified event, including how the event impacts multiple risk factors simultaneously. For example, for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign positions, as well as the corresponding debt, equity and currency exposures associated with our non-sovereign positions that may be impacted by the sovereign distress. When conducting scenario analysis, we often consider a number of possible outcomes for each scenario, ranging from moderate to severely adverse market impacts. In addition, these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forward-looking hypothetical scenarios. 

Unlike VaR measures, which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level, there may not be an implied probability that our stress testing scenarios will occur. Instead, stress testing is used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors. When estimating potential loss, we generally assume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged (although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so). 

Limits 

We use market risk limits at various levels to manage the size of our market exposures. These limits are set based on VaR and on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures. See &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management&#8221; for information about the limit approval process. 

Market Risk is responsible for monitoring these limits, and identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded (e.g., due to positional changes or changes in market conditions, such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations). Such instances are remediated by a reduction in the positions we hold and/or a temporary or permanent increase to the limit, if warranted.

Metrics 

We analyze VaR at the firmwide level and a variety of more detailed levels, including by risk category, business and region. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated. 

The table below presents our average daily VaR. 

Nine Months Ended September Three Months Ended September June September $ in millions 2022 2022 2021 2022 2021 Categories Interest rates $ 112 &#160; $ 104 $ 58 $ 97 &#160; $ 60 Equity prices 34 &#160; 36 40 34 &#160; 46 Currency rates 36 &#160; 23 12 28 &#160; 12 Commodity prices 51 &#160; 63 22 54 &#160; 22 Diversification effect (103) (102) (52) (95) (53) Total $ 130 &#160; $ 124 $ 80 $ 118 &#160; $ 87 

Our average daily VaR increased to $130 million for the three months ended September 2022 from $124 million for the three months ended June 2022, primarily due to increased exposures. The total increase was primarily driven by increases in the currency rates and interest rates categories, partially offset by a decrease in the commodity prices category. 

Our average daily VaR increased to $130 million for the three months ended September 2022 from $80 million for the three months ended September 2021, due to increased exposures and higher levels of volatility. The total increase was primarily driven by increases in the interest rates, commodity prices and currency rates categories, partially offset by an increase in the diversification effect. 

Our average daily VaR increased to $118 million for the nine months ended September 2022 from $87 million for the nine months ended September 2021, due to increased exposures and higher levels of volatility. The total increase was driven by increases in the interest rates, commodity prices and currency rates categories, partially offset by an increase in the diversification effect and a decrease in the equity prices category. 

The table below presents our period-end VaR.

Our period-end VaR decreased to $111 million as of September 2022 from $150 million as of June 2022, primarily due to reduced exposures. The total decrease was primarily driven by decreases in the interest rates and commodity prices categories, partially offset by an increase in the currency rates category. 

Our period-end VaR increased to $111 million as of September 2022 from $87 million as of September 2021, due to higher levels of volatility and increased exposures. The total increase was primarily driven by increases in the interest rates and currency rates categories, partially offset by an increase in the diversification effect. 

During the nine months ended September 2022, the firmwide VaR risk limit was exceeded on six occasions (all of which occurred during March 2022) primarily due to higher levels of volatility generally resulting from broad macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns. These limit breaches were resolved by temporary increases in the firmwide VaR risk limit and subsequent risk reductions. During this period, the firmwide VaR risk limit was also permanently increased due to higher levels of volatility. During 2021, the firmwide VaR risk limit was not exceeded and there were no permanent or temporary changes to the firmwide VaR risk limit. 

The table below presents our high and low VaR.

The table below presents, by number of business days, the frequency distribution of our daily net revenues for positions included in VaR.

Daily net revenues for positions included in VaR are compared with VaR calculated as of the end of the prior business day. Net losses incurred on a single day for such positions did not exceed our 95% one-day VaR (i.e., a VaR exception) during the three months ended September 2022 and exceeded our 95% one-day VaR on two occasions during the nine months ended September 2022. There was one VaR exception during both the three and nine months ended September 2021. 

During periods in which we have significantly more positive net revenue days than net revenue loss days, we expect to have fewer VaR exceptions because, under normal conditions, our business model generally produces positive net revenues. In periods in which our franchise revenues are adversely affected, we generally have more loss days, resulting in more VaR exceptions. The daily net revenues for positions included in VaR used to determine VaR exceptions reflect the impact of any intraday activity, including bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature. 

Sensitivity Measures 

Certain portfolios and individual positions are not included in VaR because VaR is not the most appropriate risk measure. Other sensitivity measures we use to analyze market risk are described below. 

10% Sensitivity Measures. The table below presents our market risk by asset category for positions accounted for at fair value, that are not included in VaR. 

As of September June September $ in millions 2022 2022 2021 Equity $ 1,645 &#160; $ 1,563 $ 2,034 Debt 1,984 2,107 2,385 Total $ 3,629 &#160; $ 3,670 $ 4,419 

In the table above: 

&#8226; The market risk of these positions is determined by estimating the potential reduction in net revenues of a 10% decline in the value of these positions. 

&#8226; Equity positions relate to private and restricted public equity securities, including interests in funds that invest in corporate equities and real estate and interests in hedge funds. 

&#8226; Debt positions include interests in funds that invest in corporate mezzanine and senior debt instruments, loans backed by commercial and residential real estate, corporate bank loans and other corporate debt, including acquired portfolios of distressed loans. 

&#8226; Funded equity and debt positions are included in our consolidated balance sheets in investments and loans. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about investments and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about loans. 

&#8226; These measures do not reflect the diversification effect across asset categories or across other market risk measures. 

Credit and Funding Spread Sensitivity on Derivatives and Financial Liabilities. VaR excludes the impact of changes in counterparty credit spreads, our own credit spreads and unsecured funding spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads (debt valuation adjustment) on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. The estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads (counterparty and our own) and unsecured funding spreads on derivatives (including hedges) was a loss of $2 million as of both September 2022 and June 2022. In addition, the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected was a gain of $33 million as of September 2022 and $35 million as of June 2022. However, the actual net impact of a change in our own credit spreads is also affected by the liquidity, duration and convexity (as the sensitivity is not linear to changes in yields) of those financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected, as well as the relative performance of any hedges undertaken. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity. Loans accounted for at amortized cost were $161.62 billion as of September 2022 and $159.40 billion as of June 2022, substantially all of which had floating interest rates. The estimated sensitivity to a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on such loans was $1.32 billion as of September 2022 and $1.33 billion as of June 2022 of additional interest income over a twelve-month period, which does not take into account the potential impact of an increase in costs to fund such loans. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about loans accounted for at amortized cost.

Credit Risk Management 

Overview 

Credit risk represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty (e.g., an OTC derivatives counterparty or a borrower) or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold. Our exposure to credit risk comes mostly from client transactions in OTC derivatives and loans and lending commitments. Credit risk also comes from cash placed with banks, securities financing transactions (i.e., resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending activities) and customer and other receivables. 

Credit Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our credit risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses. In addition, we hold other positions that give rise to credit risk (e.g., bonds and secondary bank loans). These credit risks are captured as a component of market risk measures, which are monitored and managed by Market Risk. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. Such derivatives also give rise to credit risk, which is monitored and managed by Credit Risk. 

Credit Risk Management Process 

Our process for managing credit risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management,&#8221; as well as the following: 

&#8226; Monitoring compliance with established credit risk limits and reporting our credit exposures and credit concentrations; 

&#8226; Establishing or approving underwriting standards; 

&#8226; Assessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations; 

&#8226; Measuring our current and potential credit exposure and losses resulting from a counterparty default; 

&#8226; Using credit risk mitigants, including collateral and hedging; and 

&#8226; Maximizing recovery through active workout and restructuring of claims. 

We also perform credit analyses, which incorporate initial and ongoing evaluations of the capacity and willingness of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations. For substantially all of our credit exposures, the core of our process is an annual counterparty credit evaluation or more frequently if deemed necessary as a result of events or changes in circumstances. We determine an internal credit rating for the counterparty by considering the results of the credit evaluations and assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the counterparty&#8217;s industry and the economic environment. The internal credit rating does not take into consideration collateral received or other credit support arrangements. Senior personnel, with expertise in specific industries, inspect and approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings. 

Our risk assessment process may also include, where applicable, reviewing certain key metrics, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, collateral values, FICO credit scores and other risk factors. 

Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form 10-Q 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Our credit risk management systems capture credit exposure to individual counterparties and on an aggregate basis to counterparties and their subsidiaries. These systems also provide management with comprehensive information about our aggregate credit risk by product, internal credit rating, industry, country and region. 

Risk Measures 

We measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in the event of non-payment by a counterparty using current and potential exposure. For derivatives and securities financing transactions, current exposure represents the amount presently owed to us after taking into account applicable netting and collateral arrangements, while potential exposure represents our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level. Potential exposure also takes into account netting and collateral arrangements. For loans and lending commitments, the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position. 

Stress Tests 

We conduct regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures, including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates, equity prices). These shocks cover a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements, including shocks to multiple risk factors, consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event. In the case of sovereign default, we estimate the direct impact of the default on our sovereign credit exposures, changes to our credit exposures arising from potential market moves in response to the default, and the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from the sovereign default. Unlike potential exposure, which is calculated within a specified confidence level, stress testing does not generally assume a probability of these events occurring. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management&#8221; for information about firmwide stress tests. 

To supplement these regular stress tests, as described above, we also conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to specific market events that we deem significant. We also utilize these stress tests to estimate the indirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country exposures, such as the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties along with the shocks to the risk factors described above. The parameters of these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test. We review estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order to understand their magnitude, highlight potential loss concentrations, and assess and mitigate our exposures where necessary. 

Limits 

We use credit risk limits at various levels, as well as underwriting standards to manage the size and nature of our credit exposures. Limits for industries and countries are based on our risk appetite and are designed to allow for regular monitoring, review, escalation and management of credit risk concentrations. See &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management&#8221; for information about the limit approval process. 

Credit Risk is responsible for monitoring these limits, and identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded. 

Risk Mitigants 

To reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. We may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis and/or to terminate transactions if the counterparty&#8217;s credit rating falls below a specified level. We monitor the fair value of the collateral to ensure that our credit exposures are appropriately collateralized. We seek to minimize exposures where there is a significant positive correlation between the creditworthiness of our counterparties and the market value of collateral we receive. 

For loans and lending commitments, depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction, we employ a variety of potential risk mitigants. Risk mitigants include collateral provisions, guarantees, covenants, structural seniority of the bank loan claims and, for certain lending commitments, provisions in the legal documentation that allow us to adjust loan amounts, pricing, structure and other terms as market conditions change. The type and structure of risk mitigants employed can significantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a loan or lending commitment. 

When we do not have sufficient visibility into a counterparty&#8217;s financial strength or when we believe a counterparty requires support from its parent, we may obtain third-party guarantees of the counterparty&#8217;s obligations. We may also mitigate our credit risk using credit derivatives or participation agreements.

Credit Exposures 

As of September 2022, our aggregate credit exposure increased as compared with December 2021, primarily reflecting increases in cash deposits with central banks and OTC derivatives. The percentage of our credit exposures arising from non-investment-grade counterparties (based on our internally determined public rating agency equivalents) decreased compared with December 2021, primarily reflecting increases in investment-grade credit exposure related to cash deposits with central banks and OTC derivatives. Our credit exposures are described further below. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents. Our credit exposure on cash and cash equivalents arises from our unrestricted cash, and includes both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits. To mitigate the risk of credit loss, we place substantially all of our deposits with highly rated banks and central banks. 

The table below presents our credit exposure from unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and the concentration by industry, region and internally determined public rating agency equivalents.

The table above excludes cash segregated for regulatory and other purposes of $22.93 billion as of September 2022 and $24.87 billion as of December 2021. 

OTC Derivatives. Our credit exposure on OTC derivatives arises primarily from our market-making activities. As a market maker, we enter into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. We manage our credit exposure on OTC derivatives using the credit risk process, measures, limits and risk mitigants described above. 

We generally enter into OTC derivatives transactions under bilateral collateral arrangements that require the daily exchange of collateral. As credit risk is an essential component of fair value, we include a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) in the fair value of derivatives to reflect counterparty credit risk, as described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. CVA is a function of the present value of expected exposure, the probability of counterparty default and the assumed recovery upon default.

Our credit exposure (before any potential recoveries) to OTC derivative counterparties that defaulted during the nine months ended September 2022 remained low, representing less than 2% of our total credit exposure from OTC derivatives. 

In the table above: 

&#8226; OTC derivative assets, included in the consolidated balance sheets, are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e., the net receivable for a given counterparty) when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement (counterparty netting) and are accounted for at fair value, net of cash collateral received under enforceable credit support agreements (cash collateral netting). 

&#8226; Collateral represents cash collateral and the fair value of securities collateral, primarily U.S. and non-U.S. government and agency obligations, received under credit support agreements, that we consider when determining credit risk, but such collateral is not eligible for netting under U.S. GAAP.

Securities Financing Transactions. We enter into securities financing transactions in order to, among other things, facilitate client activities, invest excess cash, acquire securities to cover short positions and finance certain activities. We bear credit risk related to resale agreements and securities borrowed only to the extent that cash advanced or the value of securities pledged or delivered to the counterparty exceeds the value of the collateral received. We also have credit exposure on repurchase agreements and securities loaned to the extent that the value of securities pledged or delivered to the counterparty for these transactions exceeds the amount of cash or collateral received. Securities collateral for these transactions primarily includes U.S. and non-U.S. government and agency obligations.

Other Credit Exposures. We are exposed to credit risk from our receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations and customers and counterparties. Receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations primarily consist of initial margin placed with clearing organizations and receivables related to sales of securities which have traded, but not yet settled. These receivables generally have minimal credit risk due to the low probability of clearing organization default and the short-term nature of receivables related to securities settlements. Receivables from customers and counterparties generally consist of collateralized receivables related to customer securities transactions and generally have minimal credit risk due to both the value of the collateral received and the short-term nature of these receivables.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Country Exposures. The Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to negatively affect the global economy and has resulted in significant disruptions in financial markets and increased macroeconomic uncertainty. Governments around the world have responded to Russia&#8217;s invasion by imposing economic sanctions and export controls on specific industry sectors, companies and individuals in Russia. Retaliatory restrictions against investors, non-Russian owned businesses and other sovereign states have been implemented by Russia. Businesses in the U.S. and globally continue to experience shortages in materials and increased costs for transportation, energy and raw materials due, in part, to the negative effects of the war on the global economy. The escalation or continuation of the war between Russia and Ukraine presents heightened risks relating to cyber attacks, the frequency and volume of failures to settle securities transactions, supply chain disruptions, and inflation, as well as the potential for increased volatility in commodity, currency and other financial markets. Complying with economic sanctions and restrictions imposed by governments has resulted in increased operational risk. The extent and duration of the war, sanctions and resulting market disruptions, as well as the potential adverse consequences for our business, liquidity and results of operations, are difficult to predict. 

Our senior management, risk committees and the Board receive regular briefings from our independent risk oversight and control functions, including our chief risk officer, on Russian and Ukrainian exposures, as well as other relevant risk metrics. We continue to focus on closing our positions and reducing our exposure to Russia and Ukraine, and wind down our operations in Russia. The overall direct financial impact to our net revenues for the nine months ended September 2022 from Russian and Ukrainian counterparties, borrowers, issuers and related instruments was not material. We have established a firmwide working group to identify and assess the operational risk associated with complying with economic sanctions and restrictions as a result of this invasion. In addition, to mitigate the risk of increased cyber attacks, we liaise with government agencies in order to update our monitoring processes with the latest information. 

Our total credit exposure to Russia as of September 2022 was $205 million, substantially all of which was to non-sovereign counterparties. Such exposure consisted of $13 million related to OTC derivatives and $192 million related to deposits and other receivables. In addition, our total market exposure relating to Russian issuers as of September 2022 was not material. 

Our total credit exposure to Ukrainian counterparties or borrowers and our total market exposure relating to Ukrainian issuers was not material as of September 2022. 

High external funding needs and inconsistent monetary policy have led to significant depreciation of the Turkish Lira, prompting concerns about foreign exchange reserves and economic instability. As of September 2022, our total credit exposure to Turkey was $2.23 billion, substantially all of which was to non-sovereign counterparties or borrowers. Such exposure consisted of $948 million related to OTC derivatives, $157 million related to loans and lending commitments and $1.13 billion related to secured receivables. After taking into consideration the benefit of Turkish corporate and sovereign collateral, and other risk mitigants provided by Turkish counterparties, our net credit exposure was $940 million. In addition, our total market exposure relating to Turkish issuers as of September 2022 was $(83) million, primarily to sovereign issuers. Such exposure consisted of $80 million related to debt, $(245) million related to credit derivatives and $82 million related to equities. 

In addition, economic and/or political uncertainties in Argentina, Lebanon, Venezuela, Ethiopia and Sri Lanka have led to concerns about their financial stability. Our credit exposure to counterparties or borrowers and our market exposure to issuers relating to each of these countries was not material as of September 2022.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

We have a comprehensive framework to monitor, measure and assess our country exposures and to determine our risk appetite. We determine the country of risk by the location of the counterparty, issuer&#8217;s assets, where they generate revenue, the country in which they are headquartered, the jurisdiction where a claim against them could be enforced, and/or the government whose policies affect their ability to repay their obligations. We monitor our credit exposure to a specific country both at the individual counterparty level, as well as at the aggregate country level. See &#8220;Stress Tests&#8221; for information about stress tests that are designed to estimate the direct and indirect impact of events involving the above countries. 

Operational Risk Management 

Overview 

Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or from external events. Our exposure to operational risk arises from routine processing errors, as well as extraordinary incidents, such as major systems failures or legal and regulatory matters. 

Potential types of loss events related to internal and external operational risk include: 

&#8226; Execution, delivery and process management; 

&#8226; Business disruption and system failures; 

&#8226; Employment practices and workplace safety; 

&#8226; Clients, products and business practices; 

&#8226; Damage to physical assets; 

&#8226; Internal fraud; and 

&#8226; External fraud. 

Operational Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for developing and implementing a formalized framework for assessing, monitoring and managing operational risk with the goal of maintaining our exposure to operational risk at levels that are within our risk appetite. 

Operational Risk Management Process 

Our process for managing operational risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management,&#8221; including a comprehensive data collection process, as well as firmwide policies and procedures, for operational risk events. 

We combine top-down and bottom-up approaches to manage and measure operational risk. From a top-down perspective, our senior management assesses firmwide and business-level operational risk profiles. From a bottom-up perspective, our first and second lines of defense are responsible for risk identification and risk management on a day-to-day basis, including escalating operational risks and risk events to senior management. 

We maintain a comprehensive control framework designed to provide a well-controlled environment to minimize operational risks. The Firmwide Operational Risk and Resilience Committee is responsible for overseeing operational risk, and for ensuring our business and operational resilience. 

Our operational risk management framework is designed to comply with the operational risk measurement rules under the Capital Framework and has evolved based on the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance. 

We have established policies that require all employees to report and escalate operational risk events. When operational risk events are identified, our policies require that the events be documented and analyzed to determine whether changes are required in our systems and/or processes to further mitigate the risk of future events. 

We use operational risk management applications to capture, analyze, aggregate and report operational risk event data and key metrics. One of our key risk identification and assessment tools is an operational risk and control self-assessment process, which is performed by our managers. This process consists of the identification and rating of operational risks, on a forward-looking basis, and the related controls. The results from this process are analyzed to evaluate operational risk exposures and identify businesses, activities or products with heightened levels of operational risk.

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Risk Measurement 

We measure our operational risk exposure using both statistical modeling and scenario analyses, which involve qualitative and quantitative assessments of internal and external operational risk event data and internal control factors for each of our businesses. Operational risk measurement also incorporates an assessment of business environment factors, including: 

&#8226; Evaluations of the complexity of our business activities; 

&#8226; The degree of automation in our processes; 

&#8226; New activity information; 

&#8226; The legal and regulatory environment; and 

&#8226; Changes in the markets for our products and services, including the diversity and sophistication of our customers and counterparties. 

The results from these scenario analyses are used to monitor changes in operational risk and to determine business lines that may have heightened exposure to operational risk. These analyses are used in the determination of the appropriate level of operational risk capital to hold. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See &#8220;Overview and Structure of Risk Management&#8221; for information about firmwide stress tests. 

Types of Operational Risks 

Increased reliance on technology and third-party relationships has resulted in increased operational risks, such as information and cyber security risk, third-party risk and business resilience risk. We manage those risks as follows: 

Information and Cyber Security Risk. Information and cyber security risk is the risk of compromising the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our data and systems, leading to an adverse impact to us, our reputation, our clients and/or the broader financial system. We seek to minimize the occurrence and impact of unauthorized access, disruption or use of information and/or information systems. We deploy and operate preventive and detective controls and processes to mitigate emerging and evolving information security and cyber security threats, including monitoring our network for known vulnerabilities and signs of unauthorized attempts to access our data and systems. There is increased information risk through diversification of our data across external service providers, including use of a variety of cloud-provided or -hosted services and applications. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K for further information about information and cyber security risk. 

Third-Party Risk. Third-party risk, including vendor risk, is the risk of an adverse impact due to reliance on third parties performing services or activities on our behalf. These risks may include legal, regulatory, information security, reputational, operational or any other risks inherent in engaging a third party. We identify, manage and report key third-party risks and conduct due diligence across multiple risk domains, including information security and cyber security, resilience and additional third-party dependencies. The Third-Party Risk Program monitors, reviews and reassesses third-party risks on an ongoing basis. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K for further information about third-party risk. 

Business Resilience Risk. Business resilience risk is the risk of disruption to our critical processes. We monitor threats and assess risks and seek to ensure our state of readiness in the event of a significant operational disruption to the normal operations of our critical functions or their dependencies, such as critical facilities, systems, third parties, data and/or personnel. We approach business continuity planning (BCP) through the lens of business and operational resilience. The resilience framework defines the fundamental principles for BCP and crisis management to ensure that critical functions can continue to operate in the event of a disruption. The business continuity program is comprehensive, consistent firmwide and up-to-date, incorporating new information, techniques and technologies as and when they become available, and our resilience recovery plans incorporate and test specific and measurable recovery time objectives in accordance with local market best practices and regulatory requirements, and under specific scenarios. See &#8220;Business &#8212; Business Continuity and Information Security&#8221; in Part I, Item 1 of the 2021 Form 10-K for further information about business continuity. 

Model Risk Management 

Overview 

Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions made based on model outputs that may be incorrect or used inappropriately. We rely on quantitative models across our business activities primarily to value certain financial assets and liabilities, to monitor and manage our risk, and to measure and monitor our regulatory capital. 

Model Risk, which is independent of our revenue-producing units, model developers, model owners and model users, and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our model risk through firmwide oversight across our global businesses, and provides periodic updates to senior management, risk committees and the Risk Committee of the Board. 

Goldman Sachs September 2022 Form 10-Q 

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Our model risk management framework is managed through a governance structure and risk management controls, which encompass standards designed to ensure we maintain a comprehensive model inventory, including risk assessment and classification, sound model development practices, independent review and model-specific usage controls. The Firmwide Model Risk Control Committee oversees our model risk management framework. 

Model Review and Validation Process 

Model Risk consists of quantitative professionals who perform an independent review, validation and approval of our models. This review includes an analysis of the model documentation, independent testing, an assessment of the appropriateness of the methodology used, and verification of compliance with model development and implementation standards. 

We regularly refine and enhance our models to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and our business mix. All models are reviewed on an annual basis, and new models or significant changes to existing models and their assumptions are approved prior to implementation. 

The model validation process incorporates a review of models and trade and risk parameters across a broad range of scenarios (including extreme conditions) in order to critically evaluate and verify: 

&#8226; The model&#8217;s conceptual soundness, including the reasonableness of model assumptions, and suitability for intended use; 

&#8226; The testing strategy utilized by the model developers to ensure that the models function as intended; 

&#8226; The suitability of the calculation techniques incorporated in the model; 

&#8226; The model&#8217;s accuracy in reflecting the characteristics of the related product and its significant risks; 

&#8226; The model&#8217;s consistency with models for similar products; and 

&#8226; The model&#8217;s sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions. 

See &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies &#8212; Fair Value &#8212; Review of Valuation Models,&#8221; &#8220;Liquidity Risk Management,&#8221; &#8220;Market Risk Management,&#8221; &#8220;Credit Risk Management&#8221; and &#8220;Operational Risk Management&#8221; for further information about our use of models within these areas. 

Other Risk Management 

In addition to the areas of risks discussed above, we also manage other risks, including capital, climate, compliance and conflicts. These areas of risks are discussed below. 

Capital Risk Management 

Capital risk is the risk that our capital is insufficient to support our business activities under normal and stressed market conditions or we face capital reductions or RWA increases, including from new or revised rules or changes in interpretations of existing rules, and are therefore unable to meet our internal capital targets or external regulatory capital requirements. Capital adequacy is of critical importance to us. Accordingly, we have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to maintain an appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions. Our capital management framework is designed to provide us with the information needed to identify and comprehensively manage risk, and develop and apply projected stress scenarios that capture idiosyncratic vulnerabilities with a goal of holding sufficient capital to remain adequately capitalized even after experiencing a severe stress event. See &#8220;Capital Management and Regulatory Capital&#8221; for further information about our capital management process. 

We have established a comprehensive governance structure to manage and oversee our day-to-day capital management activities and to ensure compliance with capital rules and related policies. Our capital management activities are overseen by the Board and its committees. The Board is responsible for approving our annual capital plan and the Risk Committee of the Board approves our capital management policy, which details the risk committees and members of senior management who are responsible for the ongoing monitoring of our capital adequacy and evaluation of current and future regulatory capital requirements, the review of the results of our capital planning and stress tests processes, and the results of our capital models. In addition, our risk committees and senior management are responsible for the review of our contingency capital plan, key capital adequacy metrics, including regulatory capital ratios, and capital plan metrics, such as the payout ratio, as well as monitoring capital targets and potential breaches of capital requirements. 

Our process for managing capital risk also includes independent review functions in Risk that, among other things, assess regulatory capital policies and related interpretations, escalate certain interpretations to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, and perform calculation testing to corroborate alignment with applicable capital rules.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis 

Climate Risk Management 

We categorize climate risk into physical risk and transition risk. Physical risk is the risk that asset values may decline or operations may be disrupted as a result of changes in the climate, while transition risk is the risk that asset values may decline because of changes in climate policies or changes in the underlying economy due to decarbonization. 

As a global financial institution, climate-related risks manifest in different ways across our businesses and we have continued to make significant enhancements to our climate risk management framework, including steps to further integrate climate into our broader risk management processes. We have integrated oversight of climate-related risks into our risk management governance structure, from senior management to our Board and its committees, including the Risk and Public Responsibilities Committees. The Risk Committee of the Board oversees firmwide financial and nonfinancial risks, which include climate risk, and, as part of its oversight, receives updates on our risk management approach to climate risk, including our approaches towards scenario analysis and integration into existing risk management processes. The Public Responsibilities Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of our firmwide sustainability strategy and sustainability issues affecting us, including with respect to climate change. As part of its oversight, the Public Responsibilities Committee receives periodic updates on our sustainability strategy, and also periodically reviews our governance and related policies and processes for sustainability and climate change-related risks. Senior management within Risk is responsible for the development of our climate risk program. 

We have begun incorporating climate risk into our credit evaluation and underwriting processes for select industries. Climate risk factors are now evaluated as part of transaction due diligence for select loan commitments. 

See &#8220;Business &#8212; Sustainability&#8221; in Part I, Item 1 and &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K for information about our sustainability initiatives, including in relation to climate transition. 

Compliance Risk Management 

Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to our reputation arising from our failure to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations, and our internal policies and procedures. Compliance risk is inherent in all activities through which we conduct our businesses. Our Compliance Risk Management Program, administered by Compliance, assesses our compliance, regulatory and reputational risk; monitors for compliance with new or amended laws, rules and regulations; designs and implements controls, policies, procedures and training; conducts independent testing; investigates, surveils and monitors for compliance risks and breaches; and leads our responses to regulatory examinations, audits and inquiries. We monitor and review business practices to assess whether they meet or exceed minimum regulatory and legal standards in all markets and jurisdictions in which we conduct business. 

Conflicts Management 

Conflicts of interest and our approach to dealing with them are fundamental to our client relationships, our reputation and our long-term success. The term &#8220;conflict of interest&#8221; does not have a universally accepted meaning, and conflicts can arise in many forms within a business or between businesses. The responsibility for identifying potential conflicts, as well as complying with our policies and procedures, is shared by all of our employees. 

We have a multilayered approach to resolving conflicts and addressing reputational risk. Our senior management oversees policies related to conflicts resolution and, in conjunction with Conflicts Resolution, Legal and Compliance, the Firmwide Client and Business Standards Committee, and other internal committees, formulates policies, standards and principles, and assists in making judgments regarding the appropriate resolution of particular conflicts. Resolving potential conflicts necessarily depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular situation and the application of experienced and informed judgment. 

As a general matter, Conflicts Resolution reviews financing and advisory assignments in Investment Banking and certain of our investing, lending and other activities. In addition, we have various transaction oversight committees, such as the Firmwide Capital, Commitments and Suitability Committees and other committees that also review new underwritings, loans, investments and structured products. These groups and committees work with internal and external counsel and Compliance to evaluate and address any actual or potential conflicts. The head of Conflicts Resolution reports to our chief legal officer, who reports to our chief executive officer.

Statements about the projected growth of our deposits and other funding, asset liability management and funding strategies and related interest expense savings, and our consumer lending and credit card businesses, are subject to the risk that actual growth and savings may differ, possibly materially, from that currently anticipated due to, among other things, changes in interest rates and competition from other similar products. 

Statements about planned 2022 benchmark debt issuances and the amount, composition and location of GCLA we expect to hold are subject to the risk that actual issuances and GCLA levels may differ, possibly materially, from that currently expected due to changes in market conditions, business opportunities or our funding and projected liquidity needs. 

Statements about our expected provisions for credit losses are subject to the risk that actual credit losses may differ and our expectations may change, possibly materially, from that currently anticipated due to, among other things, changes to the composition of our loan portfolio and changes in the economic environment in future periods and our forecasts of future economic conditions, as well as changes in our models, policies and other management judgments. 

Statements about our future effective income tax rate are subject to the risk that it may differ from the anticipated rate indicated in such statements, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in the tax rates applicable to us, changes in our earnings mix, our profitability and entities in which we generate profits, the assumptions we have made in forecasting our expected tax rate, the interpretation or application of existing tax statutes and regulations, as well as any corporate tax legislation that may be enacted or any guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, including with respect to the CAMT. 

Statements about the future state of our liquidity and regulatory capital ratios (including our SCB and G-SIB surcharge), and our prospective capital distributions (including dividends and repurchases), are subject to the risk that our actual liquidity, regulatory capital ratios and capital distributions may differ, possibly materially, from what is currently expected due to, among other things, the need to use capital to support clients, increased regulatory requirements resulting from changes in regulations or the interpretation or application of existing regulations, results of applicable supervisory stress tests, changes to the composition of our balance sheet and the impact of taxes on share repurchases. 

Statements about the risk exposure related to the asset recovery guarantee provided to the Government of Malaysia are subject to the risk that the actual value of, or credit received for, assets and proceeds from assets seized and returned to the Government of Malaysia may be less than currently anticipated.

Accordingly, our ability to complete the remediation activities may change, possibly materially, from what is currently expected.

Statements about our sustainability and carbon neutrality targets and goals are based on our current expectations and are subject to the risk that we may not achieve these targets and goals due to, among other things, global socio-demographic and economic trends, energy prices, lack of technological innovations, climate-related conditions and weather events, legislative and regulatory changes, and other unforeseen events or conditions. 

Statements about our plans for our people to return to our offices are based on our current expectations and that return may be delayed due to, among other factors, future events that are unpredictable, including the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, responses of governmental authorities, the emergence of new variants of COVID-19 and the effectiveness of vaccines over the long term and against new variants. 

Statements about future inflation are subject to the risk that actual inflation may differ, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in economic growth, unemployment or consumer demand. 

Statements about the impact of Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine and related sanctions and other developments on our business, results and financial position are subject to the risks that hostilities may escalate and expand, that sanctions may increase and that the actual impact may differ, possibly materially, from what is currently expected.
