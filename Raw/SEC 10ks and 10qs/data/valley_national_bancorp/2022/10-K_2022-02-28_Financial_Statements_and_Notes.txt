NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Note 1) 

Business 

Valley National Bancorp, a New Jersey Corporation (Valley), is a financial holding company whose princ ipal wholly-owned subsidiary is Valley National Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;), a national banking association providing a full range of commercial, retail and trust and investment services largely through its offices and ATM network throughout northern and central New Jersey, the New York City boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, Long Island, Westchester County, New York, Florida and Alabama. The Bank is subject to intense competition from other financial service providers and is subject to the regulation of certain federal and state agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by certain regulatory authorities. 

Valley National Bank&#8217;s subsidiaries are all included in the consolidated financial statements of Valley. These subsidiaries include, but are not limited to: 

&#8226; an insurance agency offering property and casualty, life and health insurance; 

&#8226; an asset management adviser that is a registered investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); 

&#8226; a title insurance agency in New York, which also provides services in New Jersey; 

&#8226; an advisory firm specializing in the investment and management of tax credits; 

&#8226; subsidiaries which hold, maintain and manage investment assets for the Bank; 

&#8226; a subsidiary which specializes in health care equipment lending and other commercial equipment leases; and 

&#8226; a subsidiary which owns and services New York commercial loans. 

The Bank&#8217;s subsidiaries also include real estate investment trust subsidiaries (the &#8220;REIT&#8221; subsidiaries) which own real estate related investments and a REIT subsidiary which owns some of the real estate utilized by the Bank and related real estate investments. Except for Valley&#8217;s REIT subsidiaries and its insurance agency (10% of which is owned by the insurance agency's co-CEOs), all subsidiaries mentioned above are directly or indirectly wholly-owned by the Bank. Because each REIT subsidiary must have 100 or more shareholders to qualify as a REIT, each REIT subsidiary has issued less than 20 percent of its outstanding non-voting preferred stock to individuals, most of whom are current and former Bank employees. The Bank owns the remaining preferred stock and all the common stock of the REITs. 

Basis of Presentation 

The consolidated financial statements of Valley include the Bank and all of Valley&#8217;s direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. The accounting and reporting policies of Valley conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and general practices within the financial services industry. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, Valley does not consolidate statutory trusts established for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities and related trust common securities. See Note 11 for more details. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 

Valley's previously reported consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were revised to reflect a change in the presentation for loss on extinguishment of debt. The revisions resulted in increases of $ 12.0 million and $ 32.0 million in &#8220;Loss on extinguishment of debt&#8221; and corresponding decreases in &#8220;Repayments of the long-term borrowings&#8221; for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Management determined that the effect of the changes in presentation was immaterial to these periods. 

Significant Estimates. In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition and results of operations for the periods indicated. Material estimates that require application of management&#8217;s most difficult, subjective or complex judgment and are particularly susceptible to change include: the allowance for credit losses, the evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, and income taxes. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are deemed necessary. While management uses its best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ significantly from those estimates. The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in these 

##TABLE_START 2021 Form 10-K 80 

##TABLE_END

material estimates. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Also, future amounts and values could differ materially from those estimates due to changes in values and circumstances after the balance sheet date. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, interest bearing deposits in other banks (including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) and, from time to time, overnight federal funds sold. Effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero, effectively eliminating the requirements, due to a change in its approach to monetary policy. The Federal Reserve Board indicated that it has no plans to re-impose reserve requirements but could in the future if conditions warrant. Prior to March 2020, the Bank was required by the Federal Reserve System to maintain cash reserves equal to a percentage of certain deposits. 

Investment Securities 

Debt securities are classified at the time of purchase based on management&#8217;s intention, as securities held-to-maturity, securities available-for-sale or trading securities. Investment securities classified as held-to-maturity are those that management has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. Investment securities held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using the level-yield method over the contractual term of the securities, adjusted for actual prepayments, or to call date if the security was purchased at premium. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. Realized gains or losses on the available-for-sale securities are recognized by the specific identification method and are included in net gains and losses on securities transactions within non-interest income. 

Trading debt securities wholly consisting of municipal bonds are reported at fair value with the unrealized gains or losses due to changes in fair value reported within non-interest income. Net trading gains and losses are included in net gains and 

losses on securities transactions within non-interest income. 

Equity securities are presented on the statements of financial condition at fair value with any unrealized and realized gains and losses reported in non-interest income. 

Investments in Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank stock, which have limited marketability, are carried at cost in other assets. Security transactions are recorded on a trade-date basis. 

Interest income on investments includes amortization of purchase premiums and discounts. Valley discontinues the recognition of interest on debt securities if the securities meet both of the following criteria: (i) regularly scheduled interest payments have not been paid or have been deferred by the issuer, and (ii) full collection of all contractual principal and interest payments is not deemed to be the most likely outcome. 

Allowance for Credit Losses for Held to Maturity Debt Securities 

On January 1, 2020, Valley adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13 "Financial Instruments&#8212;Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments", which requires us to estimate and recognize an allowance for credit losses for held to maturity debt securities using the current expected credit loss methodology (CECL). 

Valley's CECL model includes a zero loss expectation for certain securities within the held to maturity portfolio, and therefore Valley is not required to estimate an allowance for credit losses related to these securities. After an evaluation of qualitative factors, Valley identified the following securities types which it believes qualify for this exclusion: U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, residential mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and collateralized municipal bonds commonly referred to as Tax Exempt Mortgage Securities (TEMS). 

To measure the expected credit losses on held to maturity debt securities that have loss expectations, Valley estimates the expected credit losses using a discounted cash flow model developed by a third-party. Assumptions used in the model for pools of securities with common risk characteristics include the historical lifetime probability of default and severity of loss in the event of default, with the model incorporating several economic cycles of loss history data to calculate expected credit losses given default at the individual security level. The model is adjusted for a probability weighted multi-scenario economic forecast to estimate future credit losses. Valley uses a two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period, followed by a one-year period over which estimated losses revert to historical loss experience for the remaining life of the investment security. The economic forecast methodology and governance for debt securities is aligned with Valley's economic forecast used for the loan portfolio. Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. 

See Note 4 for more details regarding the allowance for credit losses for held to maturity securities. 

##TABLE_START 81 

2021 Form 10-K ##TABLE_END

Impairment of Available for Sale Debt Securities 

The impairment model for available for sale debt securities differs from the CECL methodology applied to held to maturity debt securities because the available for sale debt securities are measured at fair value rather than amortized cost. Available for sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses on a quarterly basis. In performing an assessment of whether any decline in fair value is due to a credit loss, Valley considers the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost, changes in credit ratings, any adverse economic conditions, as well as all relevant information at the individual security level, such as credit deterioration of the issuer or collateral underlying the security. In assessing the impairment, Valley compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected with the amortized cost basis of the security. If it is determined that the decline in fair value was due to credit losses, an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited to the amount the fair value is less than amortized cost basis. The non-credit related decrease in the fair value, such as a decline due to changes in market interest rates, is recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax. Valley also assesses the intent to sell the securities (as well as the likelihood of a near-term recovery). If Valley intends to sell an available for sale debt security or it is more likely than not that Valley will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the debt security is written down to its fair value and the write down is charged to the debt security&#8217;s fair value at the reporting date with any incremental impairment reported in earnings. See Note 4 for additional information. 

Loans Held for Sale 

Loans held for sale generally consist of residential mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market and are carried at their estimated fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis as permitted by the fair value option election under U.S. GAAP. Changes in fair value are recognized in non-interest income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income as a component of net gains on sales of loans. Origination fees and costs related to loans originated for sale (and carried at fair value) are recognized as earned and as incurred. Loans held for sale are generally sold with loan servicing rights retained by Valley. Gains recognized on loan sales include the value assigned to the rights to service the loan. See the &#8220;Loan Servicing Rights&#8221; section below. 

Loans and Loan Fees 

Loans are reported at their outstanding principal balance net of any unearned income, charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans and premium or discounts on purchased loans, except for purchased credit deteriorated (PCD) loans recorded at the purchase price, including non-credit discounts, plus the allowance for credit losses expected at the time of acquisition. Loan origination and commitment fees, net of related costs are deferred and amortized as an adjustment of loan yield over the estimated life of the loans approximating the effective interest method. 

Loans are deemed to be past due when the contractually required principal and interest payments have not been received as they become due. Loans are placed on non-accrual status generally, when they become 90 days past due and the full and timely collection of principal and interest becomes uncertain. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, interest accruals cease and uncollected accrued interest is reversed and charged against current income. Cash collections from non-accrual loans are generally credited to the loan balance, and no interest income is recognized on these loans until the principal balance has been determined to be fully collectible. A loan in which the borrowers&#8217; obligation has not been released in bankruptcy courts may be restored to an accruing basis when it becomes well secured and is in the process of collection, or all past due amounts become current under the loan agreement and collectability is no longer doubtful. 

Allowance for Credit Losses for Loans 

As previously noted, Valley adopted ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, and, as a result, the 2021 and 2020 periods presented in the consolidated financial statements follow the current expected credit losses methodology. The 2019 period has been reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP, which followed the incurred credit losses methodology. The following policies noted are under the current expected credit losses methodology. 

The allowance for credit losses (ACL) is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Provisions for credit losses for loans and recoveries on loan previously charged-off by Valley are added back to the allowance. 

Under CECL, Valley's methodology to establish the allowance for credit losses for loans has two basic components: (1) a collective reserve component for estimated lifetime expected credit losses for pools of loans that share common risk characteristics and (2) an individual reserve component for loans that do not share common risk characteristics. Previously, an allowance for loan losses was recognized based on probable incurred losses. 

##TABLE_START 2021 Form 10-K 82 

##TABLE_END

Reserves for loans that share common risk characteristics. Valley estimated the collective ACL using a current expected credit losses methodology which is based on relevant information about historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the loan balances. In estimating the component of the allowance on a collective basis, Valley uses a transition matrix model which calculates an expected life of loan loss percentage for each loan pool by generating probability of default and loss given default metrics. The metrics are based on the migration of loans from performing to loss by credit quality rating or delinquency categories using historical life-of-loan analysis periods for each loan portfolio pool, and the severity of loss, based on the aggregate net lifetime losses. The model's expected losses based on loss history are adjusted for qualitative factors. Among other things, these adjustments include and account for differences in: (i) the impact of the reasonable and supportable economic forecast, probability weightings and reversion period, (ii) other asset specific risks to the extent they do not exist in the historical loss information, and (iii) net expected recoveries of charged off loan balances. These adjustments are based on qualitative factors not reflected in the quantitative model but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses. The expected lifetime loss rate is the life of loan loss percentage from the transition matrix model plus the impact of the adjustments for qualitative factors. The expected credit losses are the product of multiplying the model&#8217;s expected lifetime loss rate by the exposure at default at period end on an undiscounted basis. 

Valley utilizes a two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period followed by a one-year period over which estimated losses revert to historical loss experience for the remaining life of the loan on a straight-line basis. The forecasts consist of a multi-scenario economic forecast model to estimate future credit losses that is governed by a cross-functional committee. The committee meets each quarter to determine which economic scenarios developed by Moody's will be incorporated into the model, as well as the relative probability weightings of the selected scenarios, based upon all readily available information. The model projects economic variables under each scenario based on detailed statistical analyses. Valley has identified and selected key variables that most closely correlated to its historical credit performance, which include: GDP, unemployment and the Case-Shiller Home Price Index. 

The loan credit quality data utilized in the transition matrix model is based on an internal credit risk rating system for the commercial and industrial loan and commercial real estate loan portfolio segments and delinquency aging status for the residential and consumer loan portfolio segments. Loans are risk-rated based on an internal credit risk grading process that evaluates, among other things: (i) the obligor&#8217;s ability to repay; (ii) the underlying collateral, if any; and (iii) the economic environment and industry in which the borrower operates. This analysis is performed at the relationship manager level for all commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans, and evaluated by the Loan Review Department on a test basis. Loans with a grade that are below a &#8220;Pass&#8221; grade are adversely classified. Once a loan becomes adversely classified, it automatically transitions from the "Pass" segment of the model to the corresponding adversely rated pool segment. Within the transition matrix model, each adverse classification or segment (Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss) has its own lifetime expected credit loss rate derived from loan-level historical transitions between the different loan risk ratings categories. 

Reserves for loans that that do not share common risk characteristics. Valley measures specific reserves for individual loans that do not share common risk characteristics with other loans, consisting of collateral dependent, troubled debt restructured ( TDR) loans, and expected TDR loans, based on the amount of lifetime expected credit losses calculated on those loans and charge-offs of those amounts determined to be uncollectible. Factors considered by Valley in measuring the extent of expected credit loss include payment status, collateral value, borrower financial condition, guarantor support and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Collateral dependent loan balances are written down to the estimated current fair value (less estimated selling costs) of each loan&#8217;s underlying collateral resulting in an immediate charge-off to the allowance, excluding any consideration for personal guarantees that may be pursued in the Bank&#8217;s collection process. If repayment is based upon future expected cash flows, the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan&#8217;s original effective interest rate is compared to the carrying value of the loan, and any shortfall is recorded as the allowance for credit losses. The effective interest rate used to discount expected cash flows is adjusted to incorporate expected prepayments, if applicable. 

Valley elected to exclude accrued interest on loans from the amortized cost of loans held for investment. The accrued interest is presented separately in the consolidated statements of financial condition. 

Loans charge-offs. Loans rated as "loss" within Valley's internal rating system are charged-off. Commercial loans are generally assessed for full or partial charge-off to the net realizable value for collateral dependent loans when a loan is between 90 or 120 days past due or sooner if it is probable that a loan may not be fully collectable. Residential loans and home equity loans are generally charged-off to net realizable value when the loan is 120 days past due (or sooner when the borrowers&#8217; obligation has been released in bankruptcy). Automobile loans are fully charged-off when the loan is 120 days past due or partially charged-off to the net realizable value of collateral, if the collateral is recovered prior to such time. Unsecured consumer loans are generally fully charged-off when the loan is 150 days past due.

Allowance for Unfunded Credit Commitments 

The allowance for unfunded credit commitments consists of undisbursed non-cancellable lines of credit, new loan commitments and commercial letters of credit valued using a similar CECL methodology as used for loans. Management's estimate of expected losses inherent in these off-balance sheet credit exposures also incorporates estimated utilization rate over the commitment's contractual period or an expected pull-through rate for new loan commitments. The allowance for unfunded credit commitments is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 

See Note 5 for a discussion of Valley&#8217;s loan credit quality and additional allowance for credit losses. 

Leases 

Lessor Arrangements. Valley's lessor arrangements primarily consist of direct financing and sales-type leases for equipment included in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio. Direct financing and sales-type leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus estimated residual value of the leased assets, net of unearned income, charge-offs and unamortized deferred costs of origination. Lease agreements may include options to renew and for the lessee to purchase the leased equipment at the end of the lease term. 

Lessee Arrangements. Valley's lessee arrangements predominantly consist of operating and finance leases for premises and equipment. The majority of the operating leases include one or more options to renew that can significantly extend the lease terms. Valley&#8217;s leases have a wide range of lease expirations through the year 2062. 

Operating and finance leases are recognized as right of use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. The ROU assets represent the right to use underlying assets for the lease terms and lease liabilities represent Valley&#8217;s obligations to make lease payments arising from the lease. The ROU assets include any prepaid lease payments and initial direct costs, less any lease incentives. At the commencement dates of leases, ROU assets and lease liabilities are initially recognized based on their net present values with the lease terms including options to extend or terminate the lease when Valley is reasonably certain that the options will be exercised to extend. ROU assets are amortized into net occupancy and equipment expense over the expected lives of the leases. 

Lease liabilities are discounted to their net present values on the balance sheet based on incremental borrowing rates as determined at the lease commencement dates using quoted interest rates for readily available borrowings, such as fixed rate FHLB borrowings, with similar terms as the lease obligations. Lease liabilities are reduced by actual lease payments. 

See Note 6 for additional information on Valley's lease related assets and obligations. 

Premises and Equipment, Net 

Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Estimated useful lives range from 3 years for capitalized software to up to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the lease or estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter. Major improvements are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance costs are charged to operations as incurred. Upon retirement or disposition, any gain or loss is credited or charged to operations. See Note 7 for further details. 

Bank Owned Life Insurance 

Valley owns bank owned life insurance (BOLI) to help offset the cost of employee benefits. BOLI is recorded at its cash surrender value. Valley&#8217;s BOLI is invested primarily in U.S. Treasury securities and residential mortgage-backed securities issued by government sponsored enterprises and Ginnie Mae. The majority of the underlying investment portfolio is managed by one independent investment firm. The change in the cash surrender value is included as a component of non-interest income and is exempt from federal and state income taxes as long as the policies are held until the death of the insured individuals. 

Other Real Estate Owned 

Valley acquires other real estate owned (OREO) through foreclosure on loans secured by real estate. OREO is reported at the lower of cost or fair value, as established by a current appraisal (less estimated costs to sell) and it is included in other assets. Any write-downs at the date of foreclosure are charged to the allowance for loan losses. Expenses incurred to maintain these properties, unrealized losses resulting from valuation write-downs after the date of foreclosure, and realized gains and losses upon sale of the properties are included in other non-interest expense. OREO totaled $ 2.3 million and $ 5.1 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. OREO included foreclosed residential real estate properties totaling $ 1.0 million at December 31, 2020. There were no forec losed residential real estate properties included in OREO at December 31, 2021.

Goodwill 

Intangible assets resulting from acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting consist of goodwill and other intangible assets (see &#8220;Other Intangible Assets&#8221; below). Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not amortized. The initial recording of goodwill and other intangible assets requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Goodwill is subject to annual tests for impairment or more often, if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired. 

On January 1, 2020, Valley adopted ASU No. 2017-04 "Intangibles&#8212;Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment," which simplified the impairment test by eliminating the step two requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, with the impairment loss not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the unit (formerly step one of the two-step test). Goodwill is allocated to Valley's reporting unit, which is a business segment or one level below, at the date goodwill is recorded. Under current accounting guidance, Valley may choose to perform an optional qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the single-step quantitative goodwill impairment test for one or more reporting units each annual period. 

Valley reviews goodwill for impairment annually during the second quarter using a quantitative test, or more frequently if a triggering event indicates impairment may have occurred. Our determination of whether or not goodwill is impaired requires us to make judgments, and use significant estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows. If we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments may change, which may result in adjustments to the recorded goodwill balance. 

Other Intangible Assets 

Other intangible assets primarily consist of loan servicing rights (largely generated from loan servicing retained by the Bank on residential mortgage loan originations sold in the secondary market to government sponsored enterprises), core deposits (the portion of an acquisition purchase price which represents value assigned to the existing deposit base) and, to a much lesser extent, various other types of intangibles obtained through acquisitions. Other intangible assets are amortized using various methods over their estimated lives and are periodically evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. If impairment is deemed to exist, an adjustment is recorded to earnings in the current period for the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount. See further details regarding loan servicing rights below. 

Loan Servicing Rights 

Loan servicing rights are recorded when originated mortgage loans are sold with servicing rights retained, or when servicing rights are purchased. Valley initially records the loan servicing rights at fair value. Subsequently, the loan servicing rights are carried at the lower of unamortized cost or market (i.e., fair value). The fair values of the loan servicing rights for each risk-stratified group of loan servicing rights are calculated using a fair value model from a third party vendor that uses various inputs and assumptions, including but not limited to, prepayment speeds, internal rate of return (&#8220;discount rate&#8221;), servicing cost, ancillary income, float rate, tax rate, and inflation. The prepayment speed and the discount rate are considered two of the most significant inputs in the model. 

Unamortized costs associated with acquiring loan servicing rights, net of any valuation allowances, are included in other intangible assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition and are accounted for using the amortization method. Valley amortizes the loan servicing assets in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing revenues. On a quarterly basis, Valley stratifies its loan servicing assets into groupings based on risk characteristics and assesses each group for impairment based on fair value. A valuation allowance is established through an impairment charge to earnings to the extent the unamortized cost of a stratified group of loan servicing rights exceeds its estimated fair value. Increases in the fair value of impaired loan servicing rights are recognized as a reduction of the valuation allowance, but not in excess of such allowance. The amortization of loan servicing rights is recorded in non-interest income.

Stock-Based Compensation 

Compensation expense for restricted stock units, restricted stock and stock option awards (i.e., non-vested stock awards) is based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant and is recognized ratably over the service period of the award. Valley's long-term incentive compensation plan includes a service period requirement for award grantees who are eligible for retirement pursuant to which an award will vest at one-twelfth per month after the grant date and requires the grantees to continue service with Valley for one year in order for the award to fully vest. Compensation expense for these awards is amortized monthly over a one year period after the grant date. The service period for non-retirement eligible employees is the shorter of the stated vesting period of the award or the period until the employee&#8217;s retirement eligibility date. The fair value of each option granted is estimated using a binomial option pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock units and awards is based upon the last sale price reported for Valley&#8217;s common stock on the date of grant or the last sale price reported preceding such date, except for performance-based stock awards with a market condition. The grant date fair value of a performance-based stock award that vests based on a market condition is determined by a third party specialist using a Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 12 for additional information. 

Business Combinations 

Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities are recorded at their acquisition-date estimated fair values. The excess of the cost of acquisition over these fair values is recognized as goodwill. During the measurement period, which cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date, changes to estimated fair values are recognized as an adjustment to goodwill. Certain transaction costs are expensed as incurred. 

Fair Value Measurements 

In general, fair values of financial instruments are based upon quoted market prices, where available. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management uses valuation techniques based upon internal and third party models requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurements. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value, including adjustments based on internal cash flow model projections that utilize assumptions similar to those incorporated by market participants. Other adjustments may include amounts to reflect counterparty credit quality and Valley&#8217;s creditworthiness, among other things, as well as unobservable parameters. Any such valuation adjustments are applied consistently over time. See Note 3 for additional information. 

Revenue Recognition 

Valley's revenue contracts generally have a single performance obligation, as the promise to transfer the individual goods or services is not separately identifiable, or distinct from other obligations within the contracts. Valley does not have a material amount of long-term customer agreements that include multiple performance obligations requiring price allocation and differences in the timing of revenue recognition. Valley has no customer contracts with variable fee agreements based upon performance. Valley's revenue within the scope of ASC Topic 606 includes: (i) trust and investment services income from investment management, investment, including tax credit, advisory services, trust, custody and other products; (ii) service charges on deposit accounts from checking accounts, savings accounts, overdrafts, insufficient funds, ATM transactions and other activities; and (iii) other income from fee income related to derivative interest rate swaps executed with commercial loan customers, fees from interchange, wire transfers, credit cards, safe deposit box, ACH, lockbox and various other products and services-related income. 

Income Taxes 

Valley uses the asset and liability method to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in the consolidated financial statements. This method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are expected to be realized. 

Valley&#8217;s expense for income taxes includes the current and deferred portions of that expense. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management's judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we expect to realize. Deferred income tax expense or benefit results from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income-tax return purposes. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. 

##TABLE_START 2021 Form 10-K 86 

##TABLE_END

Valley maintains a reserve related to certain tax positions that management believes contain an element of uncertainty. An uncertain tax position is measured based on the largest amount of benefit that management believes is more likely than not to be realized. Periodically, Valley evaluates each of its tax positions and strategies to determine whether the reserve continues to be appropriate. 

Comprehensive Income 

Comprehensive income or loss is defined as the change in equity of a business entity during a period due to transactions and other events and circumstances, excluding those resulting from investments by and distributions to shareholders. Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income or loss. Valley&#8217;s components of other comprehensive income or loss, net of deferred tax, include: (i) unrealized gains and losses on debt securities available for sale; (ii) unrealized gains and losses on derivatives used in cash flow hedging relationships; and (iii) the pension benefit adjustment for the unfunded portion of its various employee, officer, and director pension plans. Income tax effects are released from accumulated other comprehensive income on an individual unit of account basis. Valley presents comprehensive income and its components in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for all periods presented. See Note 19 for additional disclosures. 

Earnings Per Common Share 

In Valley's computation of the earnings per common share, the numerator of both the basic and diluted earnings per common share is net income available to common shareholders (which is equal to net income less dividends on preferred stock). The weighted average number of common shares outstanding used in the denominator for basic earnings per common share is increased to determine the denominator used for diluted earnings per common share by the effect of potentially dilutive common stock equivalents utilizing the treasury stock method. 

The following table shows the calculation of both basic and diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019: &#160; 

##TABLE_START 2021 2020 2019 &#160; (in thousands, except for share data) Net income available to common shareholders $ 461,152 &#160; $ 377,918 &#160; $ 297,105 &#160; Basic weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 407,445,379 &#160; 403,754,356 &#160; 337,792,270 &#160; Plus: Common stock equivalents 2,572,949 &#160; 1,291,851 &#160; 2,325,538 &#160; Diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding 410,018,328 &#160; 405,046,207 &#160; 340,117,808 &#160; Earnings per common share: Basic $ 1.13 &#160; $ 0.94 &#160; $ 0.88 &#160; Diluted 1.12 &#160; 0.93 &#160; 0.87 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Common stock equivalents represent the dilutive effect of additional common shares issuable upon the assumed vesting or exercise, if applicable, of restricted stock units and common stock options to purchase Valley&#8217;s common shares. Common stock options with exercise prices that exceed the average market price of Valley&#8217;s common stock during the periods presented may have an anti-dilutive effect on the diluted earnings per common share calculation and therefore are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation along with restricted stock units. Potential anti-dilutive weighted common shares totaled approximately 411 thousand, 1.7 million, and 288 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Preferred and Common Stock Dividends 

Valley issued 4.6 million and 4.0 million shares of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock in June 2015 and August 2017, respectively, which were initially recorded at fair value. See Note 18 for additional details on the preferred stock issuances. The preferred shares are senior to Valley common stock, whereas the current year dividends must be paid before Valley can pay dividends to its common shareholders. Preferred dividends declared are deducted from net income for computing income available to common shareholders and earnings per common share computations. 

Cash dividends to both preferred and common shareholders are payable and accrued when declared by Valley's Board of Directors.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 

As part of its asset/liability management strategies and to accommodate commercial borrowers, Valley has used interest rate swaps to hedge variability in cash flows or fair values caused by changes in interest rates. Valley also uses derivatives not designated as hedges for non-speculative purposes to (1) manage its exposure to interest rate movements related to a service for commercial lending customers, (2) share the risk of default on the interest rate swaps related to certain purchased or sold loan participations through the use of risk participation agreements and (3) manage the interest rate risk of mortgage banking activities with customer interest rate lock commitments and forward contracts to sell residential mortgage loans. Valley also has hybrid instruments, consisting of market linked certificates of deposit with an embedded swap contract. Valley records all derivatives including embedded derivatives as assets or liabilities at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. 

Cash Flow Hedges. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income or loss and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings. Valley calculates the credit valuation adjustments to the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges on a net basis by counterparty portfolio, as an accounting policy election. 

Fair Value Hedges. For derivatives designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. On a quarterly basis, Valley assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in cash flows or fair value of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in cash flows or fair value of the designated hedged item or transaction. If a hedging relationship is terminated due to ineffectiveness, and the derivative instrument is not re-designated to a new hedging relationship, the subsequent change in fair value of such instrument is charged directly to earnings. 

Interest Rate Contracts and Other Non-designated Hedges. Derivatives not designated as hedges do not meet the hedge accounting requirements under U.S. GAAP. Contracts in an asset position are included in other assets and contracts in a liability position are included in other liabilities. Changes in fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded directly in earnings within other non-interest expense. 

New Authoritative Accounting Guidance 

New Accounting Guidance Issued and Adopted in 2020. ASU No. 2020-04, "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848)" provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contract modifications and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued, subject to meeting certain criteria. Under the new guidance, an entity can elect by accounting topic or industry subtopic to account for the modification of a contract affected by reference rate reform as a continuation of the existing contract, if certain conditions are met. In addition, the new guidance allows an entity to elect on a hedge-by-hedge basis to continue to apply hedge accounting for hedging relationships in which the critical terms change due to reference rate reform, if certain conditions are met. A one-time election to sell and/or transfer held to maturity debt securities that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform is also allowed. ASU No. 2020-04 became effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 and can apply to all LIBOR reference rate modifications any time through December 31, 2022. 

Valley&#8217;s LIBOR project working group, consisting of key stakeholders from throughout Valley, continue to monitor new developments for transitioning to alternative reference rates to align with regulatory guidelines. Valley has provided both internal and external communications that reference and educate customers and associates regarding the LIBOR transition and continues to update fall back language that reference LIBOR-based rates to ensure full reference rates change readiness. Valley&#8217;s technology systems have been updated to handle the new replacement rates. Valley started originating and renewing loans at new alternative benchmark rates after December 31, 2021. SOFR and Term SOFR are the preferred rates for loans and derivatives. Loans that were closed before December 31, 2021, may continue to be priced using LIBOR until June 30, 2023. Management is still assessing the expected impact of LIBOR cessation on Valley&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

New Accounting Guidance Adopted in 2021. ASU No. 2020-08, "Codification Improvements to Subtopic 310-20, Receivables&#8212;Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs" provides clarification and affects the guidance previously issued by ASU No. 2017-08 &#8220;Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased 

##TABLE_START 2021 Form 10-K 88 

##TABLE_END

Callable Debt Securities.&#8221; ASU No. 2020-08 clarifies that an entity should reevaluate whether a debt security with multiple call dates is within the scope of paragraph 310-20-35-33. For each reporting period, to the extent that the amortized cost basis of an individual callable debt security exceeds the amount repayable by the issuer at the next call date, the premium should be amortized to the next call date, unless the guidance to consider estimated prepayments is applied. Valley adopted ASU No. 2020-08 on January 1, 2021 and the new guidance did not have a significant impact on Valley&#8217;s consolidated financial statements 

New Accounting Guidance Issued in 2021. ASU No. 2021-01 "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848)" extends some o f Accounting Standards Codification Topic 848&#8217;s optional expedients to derivative contracts impacted by the discounting transition, including for derivatives that do not reference LIBOR or other reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. ASU No. 2021-01 is effective for all entities immediately upon issuance and may be elected retrospectively to eligible modifications as of any date from the beginning of the interim period that includes March 12, 2020, or prospectively to new modifications made on or after any date within the interim period including January 7, 2021 and it can be applied through December 31, 2022, similar to the other reference rate reform relief provided under Topic 848. ASU No. 2021-01 is not expected to have a significant impact on Valley&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

ASU No. 2021-05 "Lessors &#8211; Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments". ASU No. 2021-05 updates guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842, Leases and requires a lessor to classify a lease with variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate as an operating lease at lease commencement if: (i) the lease would have been classified as a sales-type lease or direct financing lease under ASC 842 classification criteria; and (ii) the lessor would have recognized a selling loss at lease commencement. ASU No. 2021-05 is effective for Valley for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. ASU No. 2021-05 is not expected to have a significant impact on Valley&#8217;s consolidated financial statements 

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (Note 2) 

Acquisitions 

The Westchester Bank Holding Corporation 

On December 1, 2021, Valley completed its acquisition of The Westchester Bank Holding Corporation (Westchester) and its principal subsidiary, The Westchester Bank which was headquartered in White Plains, New York. As of December 1, 2021, Westchester had approximately $ 1.4 billion in assets, $ 915.0 million in loans, and $ 1.2 billion in deposits, after purchase accounting adjustments, and a branch network of seven locations in Westchester County, New York. The common shareholders of Westchester received 229.645 shares of Valley common stock for each Westchester share they owned prior to the merger. The total consideration for the merger was $ 211.1 million, consisting of approximately 15.7 million shares of Valley common stock. 

The transaction was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly t he results of Westchester's operations have been included in Valley's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 from the date of acquisition.

The determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed required management to make estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, market conditions, and other future events that are highly subjective in nature and subject to change. The fair value estimates are subject to change for up to one year after the closing date of the transaction if additional information (existing at the date of closing) relative to closing date fair values becomes available. 

Fair Value Measurement of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed 

Described below are the methods used to determine the fair values of the significant assets acquired and liabilities assumed in Westchester acquisition. 

Cash and cash equivalents. The estimated fair values of cash and cash equivalents approximate their stated face amounts, as these financial instruments are either due on demand or have short-term maturities. 

Investment securities. The investment securities acquired from Westchester were classified as held to maturity debt securities based on Valley's intent at the acquisition date. The estimated fair values of the investment securities were calculated utilizing Level 2 inputs similar to the valuation techniques used for Valley's investment portfolios detailed in Note 3. 

Loans. The acquired loan portfolio was recorded at its estimated value based on a discounted cash flow methodology. The acquired loan portfolio was segregated into categories for valuation purposes primarily based on loan type (commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, multifamily, construction, home equity and other consumer) and credit risk rating. The estimated fair value incorporates adjustments related to market loss assumptions and prevailing market interest rates for comparable assets and other market factors such as liquidity from the perspective of a market participant. Management estimated the cash flows expected to be collected at the acquisition date by using valuation models that incorporated loan contractual characteristics (such as payment type, amortization type, and term to maturity) as well as estimates of key valuation assumptions (such as prepayment speeds, default rates, and loss severity rates). The expected cash flows from the acquired loan 

##TABLE_START 2021 Form 10-K 90 

##TABLE_END

portfolios were discounted to present value based on estimated market rates. The market rates were estimated using a buildup approach based on the following components: funding cost, servicing cost, and consideration of liquidity premium. In addition, coupon rates for recently originated loans and available market data regarding origination rates were also considered in the analysis. The methods used to estimate the Level 3 fair values of loans are extremely sensitive to the assumptions and estimates used. While management attempted to use assumptions and estimates that best reflected the acquired loan portfolios and current market conditions, a greater degree of subjectivity is inherent in these values than in those determined in active markets. Also, acquired portfolio loans and leases were evaluated upon acquisition and classified as either PCD, which indicates that the loan has experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, or non-PCD. Valley considered a variety of factors in evaluating the acquired loans for a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality, including but not limited to risk grades, delinquency, non-performing status, current or previous troubled debt restructurings, watch list credits and other qualitative factors that indicated a deterioration in credit quality since origination. 

For PCD loans, an initial allowance was determined based on Valley&#8217;s CECL methodology and was added to the acquisition date fair value of each PCD loan to establish its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the unpaid principal balance of loans and the calculated amortized cost basis resulted in a net non-credit discount totaling $ 8.5 million. The net discount is expected be accreted into interest income on a level-yield method over an average contractual life of the loans totaling 8 years. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of the difference between the purchase price and the par value of the PCD loans acquired from Westchester: 

##TABLE_START December 1, 2021 ($ in thousands) Purchase price of PCD loans $ 346,883 &#160; Allowance for credit losses at acquisition 6,542 &#160; Non-credit discount at acquisition 8,457 &#160; Par value of acquired PCD loans $ 361,882 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Other intangible assets. Other intangible assets consisting of core deposit intangibles (CDI) are measures of the value of non-maturity checking, savings, NOW and money market customer deposits that are acquired in a business combination. The fair value for CDI was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology that gave appropriate consideration to expected customer attrition rates, net maintenance cost of the deposit base, alternative costs of funds, and the interest costs associated with the customer deposits. The CDI is amortized over an estimated useful life of 10 years to approximate the existing deposit relationships acquired. 

Deposits. The fair values of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity (i.e., non-interest bearing accounts and savings, NOW and money market accounts) are equal to the carrying amounts payable on demand. The fair values of certificates of deposit represent contractual cash flows, discounted to present value using interest rates currently offered on deposits with similar characteristics and remaining maturities. 

Dudley Ventures 

On October 8, 2021, Valley acquired certain subsidiaries of Arizona-based Dudley Ventures (DV), an advisory firm specializing in the investment and management of tax credits. The transaction included the acquisition of DV Fund Advisors and DV Advisory Services which were both subsequently merged and renamed Dudley Ventures, as well as DV's community development entity, DV Community Investment. The transaction price included $ 11.3 million of cash at the closing date and fixed future stock consideration totaling $ 3.8 million. On November 16, 2021, Valley also acquired DV Financial Services, a registered broker-dealer regulated by FINRA, which is largely inactive. Goodwill and other intangible assets related to the acquired DV entities totaled $ 13.1 million and $ 2.1 million, respectively. See Note 8 for further details. 

Oritani Financial Corp. 

On December 1, 2019, Valley completed its acquisition of Oritani Financial Corp. (Oritani) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Oritani Bank. Oritani had approximately $ 4.3 billion in assets, $ 3.4 billion in net loans and $ 2.9 billion in deposits, after purchase accounting adjustments, and a branch network of 26 locations. The common shareholders of Oritani received 1.60 shares of Valley common stock for each Oritani share that they owned prior to the merger. The total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $ 835.3 million, consisting of 71.1 million shares of Valley common stock and the outstanding Oritani stock-based awards. 

##TABLE_START 91 

2021 Form 10-K ##TABLE_END

During 2020, Valley revised the estimated fair values of the acquired assets as of the Oritani acquisition date due to additional information obtained that existed as of December 1, 2019. The adjustments mostly related to the fair value of certain loans, current taxes payable and the valuation of deferred tax assets as of the acquisition date. These adjustments resulted in an $ 8.8 million increase in goodwill (see Note 8 for amount of goodwill as allocated to Valley's business segments).

Pending Acquisition (Unaudited) 

Bank Leumi Le-Israel Corporation 

On September 23, 2021, Valley announced that it will acquire Bank Leumi Le-Israel Corporation, the U.S. subsidiary of Bank Leumi Le-Israel B.M., and parent company of Bank Leumi USA, and collectively referred to as "Bank Leumi USA". Bank Leumi USA maintains its headquarters in New York City and also has commercial banking offices in Chicago, Los Angeles, Palo Alto, and Aventura, Florida. As of December 31, 2021, Bank Leumi USA had total asset s of $ 8.3 billion, total deposits of $ 7.1 billion, and gross loans of $ 5.7 billion. T he common stockholders of Bank Leumi USA will receive 3.8025 shares of Valley common stock and $ 5.08 in cash (subject to specified adjustments) for each Bank Leumi USA common share they own . Based on Valley&#8217;s closing stock price on December 31, 2021, the transaction is valued at an estimated $ 1.2 billion, inclusive of the value of options and upon completion of the acquisition, Bank Leumi Le-Israel B.M. will own approximately 14 percent of Valley's common stock. Valley has received regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Office of the C omptroller of the Currency, as well as Valley shareholder approval of the issuance of Valley common stock in connection with the acquisition. The acquisition remains subject to regulatory approval by the New York State Department of Financial Services, as well as other customary closing conditions. The acquisition is anticipated to close in the second quarter 2022. 

Merger expenses for all Valley acquisition related activities totaled $ 8.9 million, $ 1.9 million and $ 16.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The merger expenses mainly consisted of salary and employee benefits, as well as professional and legal, net occupancy and equipment, and other expenses included in non-interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. 

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (Note 3) 

Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820, &#8220;Fair Value Measurement&#8221; establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below: 

&#8226; Level 1 - Unadjusted exchange quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, or identical liabilities traded as assets that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

&#8226; Level 2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly (i.e., quoted prices on similar assets) for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 

&#8226; Level 3 - Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).

(1) Includes equity securities measured as net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient totaling $ 11.6 million and $ 7.8 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These securities have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. 

(2) Represents residential mortgage loans held for sale that are carried at fair value and had contractual unpaid principal balances totaling approximately $ 136.3 million and $ 286.4 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

(3) Derivative financial instruments are included in this category. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 

The following valuation techniques were used for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. All of the valuation techniques described below apply to the unpaid principal balance, excluding any accrued interest or dividends at the measurement date. Interest income and expense are recorded within the consolidated statements of income depending on the nature of the instrument using the effective interest method based on acquired discount or premium. 

Equity securities. The fair value of equity securities consists of a publicly traded mutual fund, Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) investment fund and an investment related to the development of new financial technologies that are carried at quoted prices in active markets. Valley also has privately held CRA funds measured at NAV, which are excluded from fair value hierarchy levels in the tables above. 

Trading debt securities. The fair value of trading debt securities, consisting of municipal bonds, is reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. The prices for these investments are derived from market quotations and matrix pricing obtained through an independent pricing service. Management reviews the data and assumptions used in pricing the securities by its third-party provider to ensure the highest level of significant inputs are derived from market observable data. 

##TABLE_START 2021 Form 10-K 94 

##TABLE_END

Available for sale debt securities. U.S. Treasury securities are reported at fair value utilizing Level 1 inputs. The majority of other investment securities are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. The prices for these instruments are obtained through an independent pricing service or dealer market participants with whom Valley has historically transacted both purchases and sales of investment securities. Prices obtained from these sources include prices derived from market quotations and matrix pricing. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond&#8217;s terms and conditions, among other things. Management reviews the data and assumptions used in pricing the securities by its third party provider to ensure the highest level of significant inputs are derived from market observable data. In addition, Valley reviews the volume and level of activity for all available for sale debt securities and attempts to identify transactions which may not be orderly or reflective of a significant level of activity and volume. 

Loans held for sale. Residential mortgage loans originated for sale are reported at fair value using Level 2 inputs. The fair values were calculated utilizing quoted prices for similar assets in active markets. The market prices represent a delivery price, which reflects the underlying price each institution would pay Valley for an immediate sale of an aggregate pool of mortgages. Non-performance risk did not materially impact the fair value of mortgage loans held for sale at December 31, 2021 and 2020 based on the short duration these assets were held and the credit quality of these loans. 

Derivatives. Derivatives are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. The fair values of Valley&#8217;s derivatives are determined using third party prices that are based on discounted cash flow analysis using observed market inputs, such as the LIBOR, Overnight Index Swap and Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) curves f or all cleared derivatives. The fair value of mortgage banking derivatives, consisting of interest rate lock commitments to fund residential mortgage loans and forward commitments for the future delivery of such loans (including certain loans held for sale at December 31, 2021 and 2020), is determined based on the current market prices for similar instruments. The fair values of most of the derivatives incorporate credit valuation adjustments, which consider the impact of any credit enhancements to the contracts, to account for potential nonperformance risk of Valley and its counterparties. The credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of Valley&#8217;s derivatives at December 31, 2021 and 2020. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis 

The following valuation techniques were used for certain non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, including collateral dependent loans reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral, loan servicing rights and foreclosed assets, which are reported at fair value upon initial recognition or subsequent impairment as described below. 

Collateral dependent loans. Collateral dependent loans are loans where foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and substantially all of the repayment is expected from the collateral. Collateral values are estimated using Level 3 inputs, consisting of individual third-party appraisals that may be adjusted based on certain discounting criteria. Certain real estate appraisals may be discounted based on specific market data by location and property type. At December 31, 2021, collateral dependent loans were individually re-measured and reported at fair value through direct loan charge-offs to the allowance for loan losses based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. The collateral dependent loan direct charge-offs to the allowance for loan losses totaled $ 2.1 million and $ 4.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2021, collateral dependent loans with a total amortized cost of $ 114.8 million and $ 104.4 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, including our taxi medallion loan portfolio, were reduced by specific allowance for loan losses allocations totaling $ 66.9 million and $ 69.1 million to a reported total net carrying amount of $ 47.9 million and $ 35.2 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Loan servicing rights. Fair values for each risk-stratified group of loan servicing rights are calculated using a fair value model from a third party vendor that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (Level 3). The fair value model is based on various assumptions, including but not limited to, prepayment speeds, internal rate of return (discount rate), servicing cost, ancillary income, float rate, tax rate, and inflation. The prepayment speed and the discount rate are considered two of the most significant inputs in the model. At December 31, 2021, the fair value model used a blended prepayment speed (stated as constant prepayment rates) of 12.9 percent and a discount rate of 9.0 percent for the valuation of the loan servicing rights. A significant degree of judgment is involved in valuing the loan servicing rights using Level 3 inputs. The use of different assumptions could have a significant positive or negative effect on the fair value estimate. Impairment charges are recognized on loan servicing rights when the amortized cost of a risk-stratified group of loan servicing rights exceeds the estimated fair value. Certain loan servicing rights were re-measured at fair value totaling $ 15.6 million at December 31, 2020. There were no loan servicing rights re-measured at fair value at December 31, 2021. See Note 8 for additional information. 

##TABLE_START 95 

2021 Form 10-K ##TABLE_END

Foreclosed assets. Certain foreclosed assets (consisting of other real estate owned and other repossessed assets included in other assets), upon initial recognition and transfer from loans, are re-measured and reported at fair value using Level 3 inputs, consisting of a third-party appraisal less estimated cost to sell. When an asset is acquired, the excess of the loan balance over fair value, less estimated selling costs, is charged to the allowance for loan losses. If further declines in the estimated fair value of the asset occur, an asset is re-measured and reported at fair value through a write-down recorded in non-interest expense. At December 31, 2021, the adjustments to appraisals of foreclosed assets were no t material as compared to adjustments ranging from 1.5 percent to 22 percent at December 31, 2020. 

Other Fair Value Disclosures 

ASC Topic 825, &#8220;Financial Instruments,&#8221; requires disclosure of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis. 

The fair value estimates presented in the following table were based on pertinent market data and relevant information on the financial instruments available as of the valuation date. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire portfolio of financial instruments. Because no market exists for a portion of the financial instruments, fair value estimates may be based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 

Fair value estimates are based on existing balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. For instance, Valley has certain fee-generating business lines (e.g., its mortgage servicing operation, trust and investment management departments) that were not considered in these estimates since these activities are not financial instruments. In addition, the tax implications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of the estimates.

Actual maturities of available for sale debt securities may differ from those presented above since certain obligations provide the issuer the right to call or prepay the obligation prior to scheduled maturity without penalty. 

The weighted-average remaining expected life for residential mortgage-backed securities available for sale was 5.0 years at December 31, 2021. 

Impairment Analysis of Available for Sale Debt Securities 

Valley's available for sale debt securities portfolio includes corporate bonds and revenue bonds, among other securities. These types of securities may pose a higher risk of future impairment charges by Valley as a result of the unpredictable nature of the U.S. economy and its potential negative effect on the future performance of the security issuers, including due to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Available for sale debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses on a quarterly basis. See Note 1 for further information regarding Valley's accounting policy. Valley has evaluated available for sale debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2021 included in the table above and has determined that the declines in fair value are mainly attributable to market volatility, not credit quality or other factors. Based on a comparison of the present value of expected cash flows to the amortized cost, management recognized no impairment during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and, as a result, there was no allowance for credit losses for available for sale debt securities at December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Obligations of states and political subdivisions include municipal bonds and revenue bonds issued by various municipal corporations. At December 31, 2021, most of the obligations of states and political subdivisions were rated investment grade and a large portion of the "non-rated" category included TEMS securities secured by Ginnie Mae securities. Trust preferred securities consist of non-rated single-issuer securities, issued by bank holding companies. Corporate bonds consist of debt primarily issued by banks. 

Allowance for Credit Losses for Held to Maturity Debt Securities 

Valley has a zero loss expectation for certain securities within the held to maturity portfolio, and therefore it is not required to estimate an allowance for credit losses related to these securities under the CECL standard. After an evaluation of qualitative factors, Valley identified the following securities types which it believes qualify for this exclusion: U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, residential mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and collateralized municipal bonds called TEMS. To measure the expected credit losses on held to maturity debt securities that have loss expectations, Valley estimates the expected credit losses using a discounted cash flow model developed by a third-party. See Note 1 for further details.

Related Party Loans 

In the ordinary course of business, Valley has granted loans to certain directors, executive officers and their affiliates (collectively referred to as &#8220;related parties&#8221;). These loans were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other unaffiliated persons and do not involve more than normal risk of collectability.

Loan Portfolio Risk Elements and Credit Risk Management 

Credit risk management. For all loan types discussed below, Valley adheres to a credit policy designed to minimize credit risk while generating the maximum income given the level of risk appetite. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis with subsequent approval by the Board of Directors annually. Credit authority relating to a significant dollar percentage of the overall portfolio is centralized and controlled by the Credit Risk Management Division and by the Credit Committee. A reporting system supplements the management review process by providing management with frequent reports concerning loan production, loan quality, internal loan classification, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies, non-performing, and potential problem loans. Loan portfolio diversification is an important factor utilized by Valley to manage its risk across business sectors and through cyclical economic circumstances. 

Commercial and industrial loans. A significant portion of Valley&#8217;s commercial and industrial loan portfolio is granted to long standing customers of proven ability, strong repayment performance, and high character. Underwriting standards are designed to assess the borrower&#8217;s ability to generate recurring cash flow sufficient to meet the debt service requirements of loans granted. While such recurring cash flow serves as the primary source of repayment, a significant number of the loans are collateralized by borrower assets intended to serve as a secondary source of repayment should the need arise. Anticipated cash flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value, or in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the ability of the borrower to collect all amounts due from its customers. Short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis based on a borrower&#8217;s financial strength and past performance. Whenever possible, Valley will obtain the personal guarantee of the borrower&#8217;s principals to mitigate the risk. Unsecured loans, when made, are generally granted to the Bank&#8217;s most credit worthy borrowers. Unsecured commercial and industrial loans totaled $ 1.0 billion and $ 2.7 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively (including $ 436.0 million and $ 2.2 billion of SBA guaranteed PPP loans, respectively). The commercial portfolio also includes taxi medallion loans totaling approximately $ 86.0 million with related reserves of $ 58.5 million at December 31, 2021. All of these loans are on non-accrual status due to ongoing weakness exhibited in the taxi industry caused by strong competition from alternative ride-sharing services and the economic stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Commercial real estate loans . Commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans but generally they involve larger principal balances and longer repayment periods as compared to commercial and industrial loans. Commercial real estate loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real property. Repayment of most loans is dependent upon the cash flow generated from the property securing the loan or the business that occupies the property. Commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy and accordingly, conservative loan to value ratios are required at origination, as well as stress tested to evaluate the impact of market changes relating to key underwriting elements. The properties securing the commercial real estate portfolio represent diverse types, with most properties located within Valley&#8217;s primary markets. 

Construction loans . With respect to loans to developers and builders, Valley originates and manages construction loans structured on either a revolving or non-revolving basis, depending on the nature of the underlying development project. These loans are generally secured by the real estate to be developed and may also be secured by additional real estate to mitigate the risk. Non-revolving construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantially all committed funds with repayment substantially dependent on the successful completion and sale, or lease, of the project. Sources of repayment for these types of loans may be from pre-committed permanent loans from other lenders, sales of developed property, or an interim loan commitment from Valley until permanent financing is obtained elsewhere. Revolving construction loans (generally relating to single-family residential construction) are controlled with loan advances dependent upon the presale of housing units financed. These loans are closely monitored by on-site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes, governmental regulation of real property, general economic conditions and the availability of long-term financing. 

Residential mortgages. Valley originates residential, first mortgage loans based on underwriting standards that generally comply with Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac requirements. Appraisals and valuations of real estate collateral are contracted directly with independent appraisers or from valuation services and not through appraisal management companies. The Bank&#8217;s appraisal management policy and procedure is in accordance with regulatory requirements and guidance issued by the Bank&#8217;s primary regulator. Credit scoring, using FICO &#174; and other proprietary credit scoring models are employed in the ultimate, judgmental credit decision by Valley&#8217;s underwriting staff. Valley does not use third party contract underwriting services. Residential mortgage loans include fixed and variable interest rate loans secured by one to four family homes mostly located in northern and central New Jersey, the New York City metropolitan area, and Florida. Valley&#8217;s ability to be repaid on such loans is closely linked to the economic and real estate market conditions in these regions. In deciding whether to originate each residential mortgage, Valley considers the qualifications of the borrower as well as the value of the underlying property.

Home equity loans. Home equity lending consists of both fixed and variable interest rate products. Valley mainly provides home equity loans to its residential mortgage customers within the footprint of its primary lending territory. Valley generally will not exceed a combined (i.e., first and second mortgage) loan-to-value ratio of 80 percent when originating a home equity loan. 

Automobile loans. Valley uses both judgmental and scoring systems in the credit decision process for automobile loans. Automobile originations (including light truck and sport utility vehicles) are largely produced via indirect channels, originated through approved automobile dealers. Automotive collateral is generally a depreciating asset and there are times in the life of an automobile loan where the amount owed on a vehicle may exceed its collateral value. Additionally, automobile charge-offs will vary based on the strength or weakness of the used vehicle market, original advance rate, when in the life cycle of a loan a default occurs and the condition of the collateral being liquidated. Where permitted by law, and subject to the limitations of the bankruptcy code, deficiency judgments are sought and acted upon to ultimately collect all money owed, even when a default resulted in a loss at collateral liquidation. Valley uses a third party to actively track collision and comprehensive risk insurance required of the borrower on the automobile and this third party provides coverage to Valley in the event of an uninsured collateral loss. 

Other consumer loans. Valley&#8217;s other consumer loan portfolio includes direct consumer term loans, both secured and unsecured. The other consumer loan portfolio includes exposures in personal lines of credit (mainly those secured by cash surrender value of life insurance), credit card loans and personal loans. Unsecured consumer loans totaled approximately $ 54.0 million and $ 49.4 million, including $ 12.8 million and $ 8.8 million of credit card loans, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Management believes the aggregate risk exposure to unsecured loans and lines of credit was not significant at December 31, 2021.

If interest on non-accrual loans had been accrued in accordance with the original contractual terms, such interest income would have amounted to approximately $ 7.1 million , $ 6.2 million, and $ 2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively; none of these amounts were included in interest income during these periods. 

Credit quality indicators . Valley utilizes an internal loan classification system as a means of reporting problem loans within commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, and construction loan portfolio classes. Under Valley&#8217;s internal risk rating system, loan relationships could be classified as &#8220;Pass,&#8221; &#8220;Special Mention,&#8221; &#8220;Substandard,&#8221; &#8220;Doubtful,&#8221; and &#8220;Loss.&#8221; Substandard loans include loans that exhibit well-defined weakness and are characterized by the distinct possibility that Valley will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loans classified as Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, based on currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans classified as Loss are those considered uncollectible with insignificant value and are charged-off immediately to the allowance for loan losses, and, therefore, not presented in the table below. Loans that do not currently pose a sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but pose weaknesses that deserve management&#8217;s close attention are deemed Special Mention. Pass rated loans do not currently pose any identified risk and can range from the highest to average quality, depending on the degree of potential risk. Risk ratings are updated any time the situation warrants.

Troubled debt restructured loans . From time to time, Valley may extend, restructure, or otherwise modify the terms of existing loans, on a case-by-case basis, to remain competitive and retain certain customers, as well as assist other customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties. If the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a concession has been made at the time of such modification, the loan is classified as a troubled debt restructured loan (TDR). 

Generally, the concessions made for TDRs involve lowering the monthly payments on loans through either a reduction in interest rate below a market rate, an extension of the term of the loan without a corresponding adjustment to the risk premium reflected in the interest rate, or a combination of these two methods. The concessions may also involve payment deferrals but rarely result in the forgiveness of principal or accrued interest. In addition, Valley frequently obtains additional collateral or guarantor support when modifying such loans. If the borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous terms of the loan and Valley&#8217;s underwriting process shows the borrower has the capacity to continue to perform under the restructured terms, the loan will continue to accrue interest. Non-accruing restructured loans may be returned to accrual status when there has been a sustained period of repayment performance (generally six consecutive months of payments) and both principal and interest are deemed collectible. 

Performing TDRs (not reported as non-accrual loans) totaled $ 71.3 million and $ 57.4 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Non-performing TDRs totaled $ 117.2 million and $ 92.8 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The total TDRs presented in the table above had allocated a specific allowance for loan losses that totaled $ 29.1 million and $ 21.1 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were $ 6.0 million and $ 7.7 million of charge-offs related to TDRs for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively . At December 31, 2021, the commercial and industrial loan category in the above table mostly consisted of non-accrual TDR taxi medallion loans classified as substandard and doubtful. Valley did not extend any commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans have been modified as TDRs during the year ended December 31, 2021. 

Loans modified as TDRs within the previous 12 months and for which there was a payment default ( 90 or more days past due) in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:

Forbearance . In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact to certain customers, Valley implemented short-term loan modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or delays in payment, when requested by customers, all of which were insignificant. As of December 31, 2021, Valley had approximately $ 28 million of outstanding loans remaining in their payment deferral period under short-term modifications as compared to 

##TABLE_START 2021 Form 10-K 112

approximately $ 361 million of loans in deferral at December 31, 2020. Under the applicable guidance, none of these loans were classified as TDRs at December 31, 2021 and 2020. 

Collateral dependent loans. Loans are collateral-dependent when the debtor is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the sale or operation of the collateral. When Valley determines that foreclosure is probable, the collateral dependent loan balances are written down to the estimated current fair value (less estimated selling costs) resulting in an immediate charge-off to the allowance, excluding any consideration for personal guarantees that may be pursued in the Bank&#8217;s collection process. 

The following table presents collateral dependent loans by class as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:

&#8226; $ 125 million of 5.125 percent subordinated notes issued in September 2013 and due September 27, 2023 with no call dates or prepayments allowed, unless certain conditions exist. Interest on the subordinated debentures is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 27 and September 27 of each year. In conjunction with the issuance, Valley entered into an interest rate swap transaction used to hedge the change in the fair value of the subordinated notes. In August 2016, the fair value interest rate swap with a notional amount of $ 125 million was terminated resulting in an adjusted fixed annual interest rate of 3.32 percent on the subordinated notes, after amortization of the derivative valuation adjustment recorded at the termination date. The subordinated notes had a net carrying value of $ 125.2 million and $ 130.5 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The debt prepayment was funded by excess cash liquidity. The transaction was accounted for as an early debt extinguishment resulting in a loss of $ 2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Pledged Securities. The fair value of securities pledged to secure public deposits, repurchase agreements, lines of credit, FHLB advances and for other purposes required by law approximated $ 1.7 billion and $ 2.1 billion for December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ISSUED TO CAPITAL TRUSTS (Note 11) 

All of the statutory trusts presented in the table below were acquired in past bank acquisitions. These trusts were established for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities and related trust common securities. The proceeds from such issuances were used by the trust to purchase an equivalent amount of junior subordinated debentures issued by the acquired bank, and now assumed by Valley. The junior subordinated debentures, the sole assets of the trusts, are unsecured obligations of Valley, and are subordinate and junior in right of payment to all present and future senior and subordinated indebtedness and certain other financial obligations of Valley. Valley does not consolidate its capital trusts based on U.S. GAAP but wholly owns all of the common securities of each trust.

(1) The carrying values include unamortized purchase accounting adjustments at December 31, 2021 and 2020. 

(2) All cash distributions are cumulative. 

The trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the junior subordinated debentures at the stated maturity date or upon early redemption. The trusts&#8217; ability to pay amounts due on the trust preferred securities is solely dependent upon Valley making payments on the related junior subordinated debentures. Valley&#8217;s obligation under the junior subordinated debentures and other relevant trust agreements, in aggregate, constitutes a full and unconditional guarantee by Valley of the trusts&#8217; obligations under the trust preferred securities issued. Under the junior subordinated debenture agreements, Valley has the right to defer payment of interest on the debentures and, therefore, distributions on the trust preferred securities, for up to five years , but not beyond the stated maturity dates in the table above. Currently, Valley has no intention to exercise its right to defer interest payments on the debentures. 

The trust preferred securities are included in Valley&#8217;s total risk-based capital (as Tier 2 capital) for regulatory purposes at December 31, 2021 and 2020. 

BENEFIT PLANS (Note 12) 

Pension Plan 

The Bank has a non-contributory defined benefit plan (qualified plan) covering most of its employees. The qualified plan benefits are based upon years of credited service and the employee&#8217;s highest average compensation as defined. Additionally, the Bank has a supplemental non-qualified, non-funded retirement plan, which is designed to supplement the pension plan for key officers, and Valley has a non-qualified, non-funded directors&#8217; retirement plan (both of these plans are referred to as the &#8220;non-qualified plans&#8221; below). 

Effective December 31, 2013, the benefits earned under the qualified and non-qualified plans were frozen. As a result, Valley re-measured the projected benefit obligation of the affected plans and the funded status of each plan at June 30, 2013. Consequently, participants in each plan will not accrue further benefits and their pension benefits will be determined based on their compensation and service as of December 31, 2013. Plan benefits will not increase for any compensation or service earned after such date. All participants were immediately vested in their frozen accrued benefits if they were employed by the Bank as of December 31, 2013.

In determining discount rate assumptions, management looks to current rates on fixed-income corporate debt securities that receive a rating of AA or higher from either Moody&#8217;s or S&#38;P with durations equal to the expected benefit payments streams required of each plan. The weighted average discount rate used in determining the actuarial present value of benefit obligations for the qualified and non-qualified plans was 2.87 percent a nd 2.52 percent as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The net periodic pension income for the qualified and non-qualified plans reported within other non-interest expense included the following components for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019: &#160; 

##TABLE_START 2021 2020 2019 &#160; (in thousands) Interest cost $ 3,510 &#160; $ 4,941 &#160; $ 6,113 &#160; Expected return on plan assets ( 16,364 ) ( 17,200 ) ( 16,453 ) Amortization of net loss 1,538 &#160; 1,003 &#160; 264 &#160; Total net periodic pension income $ ( 11,316 ) $ ( 11,256 ) $ ( 10,076 ) ##TABLE_END

Valley estimated the interest cost component of net periodic pension income (as shown in the table above) using a spot rate approach for the plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows. Valley believes this provides a better estimate of interest costs than a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the applicable period. 

Other changes in the qualified and non-qualified plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: &#160;

The expected rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on the concept that it is a long-term assumption independent of the current economic environment and changes would be made in the expected return only when long-term inflation expectations change, asset allocations change materially or when asset class returns are expected to change for the long-term. 

In accordance with Section 402 (c) of ERISA, the qualified plan&#8217;s investment managers are granted full discretion to buy, sell, invest and reinvest the portions of the portfolio assigned to them consistent with the Bank&#8217;s Pension Committee&#8217;s policy and guidelines. The target asset allocation set for the qualified plan is an approximate equal weighting of 50 percent fixed income securities and 50 percent equity securities. Although much depends upon market conditions, the absolute investment 

##TABLE_START 2021 Form 10-K 124 

##TABLE_END

objective for the equity portion is to earn at least a mid-to-high single digit return, after adjustment by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), over rolling five-year periods. Relative performance should be above the median of a suitable grouping of other equity portfolios and a suitable index over rolling three-year periods. For the fixed income portion, the absolute objective is to earn a positive annual real return, after adjustment by the CPI, over rolling five-year periods. Relative performance should be better than the median performance of bonds when judged against a suitable index of other fixed income portfolios and above the Merrill Lynch Intermediate Government/Corporate Index over rolling three-year periods. Cash equivalents will be invested in money market funds or in other high quality instruments approved by the Trustees of the qualified plan. 

The exposure of the plan assets of the qualified plan to risk is limited by the Bank&#8217;s Pension Committee&#8217;s diversification of the investments into various investment options with multiple asset managers. The Pension Committee engages an investment management advisory firm that regularly monitors the performance of the asset managers and ensures they are within compliance of the policies adopted by the Trustees. If the risk profile and overall return of assets managed are not in line with the risk objectives or expected return benchmarks for the qualified plan, the advisory firm may recommend the termination of an asset manager to the Pension Committee. In general, the plan assets of the qualified plan are investment securities that are well-diversified in terms of industry, capitalization and asset class. 

The following table presents the qualified plan weighted-average asset allocations by asset category that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 820. Financial assets are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. See Note 3 for further details regarding the fair value hierarchy. &#160;

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value: 

Equity securities, U.S. Treasury securities and cash and money market funds are valued at fair value in the tables above utilizing exchange quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments (Level 1 inputs). Mutual funds are measured at their respective net asset values, which represents fair values of the securities held in the funds based on exchange quoted prices available in active markets (Level 1 inputs). 

##TABLE_START 125 

2021 Form 10-K ##TABLE_END

Corporate bonds and U.S. government agency securities are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. The prices for these investments are derived from market quotations and matrix pricing obtained through an independent pricing service. Such fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bond&#8217;s terms and conditions, among other things. 

Based upon actuarial estimates, Valley does not expect to make any contributions to the qualified plan. Funding requirements for subsequent years are uncertain and will significantly depend on whether the plan&#8217;s actuary changes any assumptions used to calculate plan funding levels, the actual return on plan assets, changes in the employee groups covered by the plan, and any legislative or regulatory changes affecting plan funding requirements. For tax planning, financial planning, cash flow management or cost reduction purposes, Valley may increase, accelerate, decrease or delay contributions to the plan to the extent permitted by law. 

Other Non-Qualified Plans 

Valley maintains separate non-qualified plans for former directors and senior management of Merchants Bank of New York acquired in January of 2001. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the remaining obligations under these plans were $ 1.3 million and $ 1.4 million, respectively, of which $ 348 thousand and $ 399 thousand, respectively, were funded by Valley. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, all of the obligations were included in other liabilities and $ 660 thousand (net of a $ 257 thousand tax benefit) and $ 731 thousand (net of a $ 286 thousand tax benefit), respectively, were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The $ 917 thousand in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified to expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining benefit periods of these non-qualified plans. 

Valley assumed, in the Oritani acquisition on December 1, 2019, certain obligations under non-qualified retirement plans described below: 

&#8226; Non-qualified benefit equalization pension plan that provided benefits to certain officers who were disallowed certain benefits under former Oritani&#8217;s qualified pension plan. This plan was terminated on November 30, 2019 and the accrued benefits are payable to plan participants in five equal installments beginning annually on December 1, 2020 through December 1, 2024. The funded obligation under this plan totaled $ 979 thousand and $ 1.3 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

&#8226; Supplemental Executive Retirement Income Agreement (the SERP) for the former CEO of Oritani. The SERP is a retirement benefit with a minimum payment period of 20 years upon death, disability, normal retirement, early retirement or separation from service after a change in control. Distributions from the plan began on July 1, 2020. The funded obligation under the SERP totaled $ 13.9 million and $ 13.6 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Valley recorded $ 357 thousand and $ 1.5 million of expenses related to the SERP for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

The above Oritani non-qualified plans are secured by investments in money market mutual funds which are held in a trust and classified as equity securities on the consolidated statements of financial condition at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. 

Valley also assumed an Executive Group Life Insurance Replacement (&#8220;Split-Dollar&#8221;) Plan from Oritani. The Split-Dollar plan provides life insurance benefits to certain eligible employees upon death while employed or following termination of employment due to disability, retirement or change in control. Participants in the Split-Dollar plan are entitled to up to two times their base annual salary, as defined by the plan. The accrued liability for the Split-Dollar plan totaled $ 1.7 million and $ 1.8 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. Valley recorded $ 104 thousand and $ 812 thousand of expenses related to the Split-Dollar plan f or the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively . 

Bonus Plan 

Valley National Bank and its subsidiaries may award cash incentive and merit bonuses to its officers and employees based upon a percentage of the covered employees&#8217; compensation as determined by the achievement of certain performance objectives. Amounts charged to salary expense were $ 29.0 million, $ 25.1 million and $ 19.1 million during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Savings and Investment Plan 

Valley National Bank maintains a 401(k) plan that covers eligible employees of the Bank and its subsidiaries and allows employees to contribute a percentage of their salary, with the Bank matching a certain percentage of the employee contribution in cash invested in accordance with each participant&#8217;s investment elections. The Bank recorded $ 10.7 million, $ 10.1 million and $ 8.6 million in expense for contributions to the plan for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

##TABLE_START 2021 Form 10-K 126 

##TABLE_END

Deferred Compensation Plan 

Valley has a non-qualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan maintained for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for selected employees participating in the 401(k) plan whose contributions are limited as a result of the limitations under Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code. Each participant in the plan is permitted to defer per calendar year, up to five percent of the portion of the participant&#8217;s salary and cash bonus above the limit in effect under the Company's 401(k) plan and receive employer matching contributions that become fully vested after two years of participation in the plan. Plan participants also receive an annual interest crediting on their balances held as of December 31 each year. Benefits are generally paid to a participant in a single lump sum following the participant&#8217;s separation from service with Valley. Valley recorded plan expenses of $ 415 thousand, $ 372 thousand and $ 273 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, Valley had an unsecured general liability of $ 2.4 million and $ 1.7 million, respectively, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in connection with this plan. 

Stock Based Compensation 

On April 19, 2021, Valley's shareholders approved the Valley National Bancorp 2021 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2021 Plan) administered by the Compensation and Human Capital Management Committee (the Committee) as appointed by Valley's Board of Directors. The purposes of the 2021 Plan are to provide additional incentives to officers and key employees of Valley and its subsidiaries, whose substantial contributions are essential to the continued growth and success of Valley, and to attract and retain officers, other employees and non-employee directors whose efforts will result in the continued and long-term growth of Valley's business. Upon shareholder approval of the 2021 Plan, Valley ceased granting new awards under the Valley National Bancorp 2016 Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan). 

Under the 2021 Plan, Valley may issue awards to its officers, employees and non-employee directors in amounts up to 9 million shares of common stock (less one share for every share granted after December 31, 2020 under the 2016 Plan) in the form of stock appreciation rights, both incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units (RSUs). If after December 31, 2020 any award granted under the 2016 Plan is forfeited, expires, settled for cash, withheld for tax obligations, or otherwise does not result in the issuance of all or a portion of the shares subject to such award, the shares will be added to the 2021 Plan's share reserve. As of December 31, 2021 , 7.4 million sh ares of common stock were available for issuance under the 2021 Plan. The essential features of each award are described in the award agreement relating to that award. The grant, exercise, vesting, settlement or payment of an award may be based upon the fair value of Valley's common stock on the last sale price reported for Valley's common stock on such date or the last sale price reported preceding such date, except for performance-based awards with a market condition. The grant date fair values of performance-based awards that vest based on a market condition are determined by a third-party specialist using a Monte Carlo valuation model. 

Valley recorded total stock-based compensation expense of $ 20.9 million, $ 16.5 million and $ 15.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The stock-based compensation expense for 2021, 2020 and 2019 included $ 1.6 million, $ 1.5 million and $ 2.1 million, respectively, related to stock awards granted to retirement eligible employees. Compensation expense for awards to retirement eligible employees is amortized monthly over a one year required service period after the grant date. The fair values of all other stock awards are expensed over the shorter of the vesting or required service period. As of December 31, 2021, the unrecognized amortization expense for all stock-based compensation totaled approximately $ 18.6 million and will be recognized over an average remaining vesting period of approximately 1.82 years . 

Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) . Restricted stock units are awarded as (1) performance-based RSUs and (2) time-based RSUs. Performance based RSUs vest based on (i) growth in tangible book value per share plus dividends and (ii) total shareholder return as compared to our peer group. The performance based RSUs "cliff" vest after three years based on the cumulative performance of Valley during that time period. Generally, time-based RSUs vest ratably one-third each year over a three-year vesting period. The RSUs earn dividend equivalents (equal to cash dividends paid on Valley's common share) over the applicable performance or service period. Dividend equivalents, per the terms of the agreements, are accumulated and paid to the grantee at the vesting date, or forfeited if the applicable performance or service conditions are not met. The grant date fair value of the performance-based RSUs was $ 12.36 , $ 10.99 and $ 10.14 per share for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The grant date fair value of time-based RSUs was $ 12.01 , $ 10.29 , $ 10.32 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

Stock Options . The fair value of each option granted on the date of grant is estimated using a binomial option pricing model. The fair values are estimated using assumptions for dividend yield based on the annual dividend rate; the stock volatility, based on Valley&#8217;s historical and implied stock price volatility; the risk-free interest rates, based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity bonds, in effect on the actual grant dates, with a remaining term approximating the expected term of the options; and expected exercise term calculated based on Valley&#8217;s historical exercise experience.

##TABLE_START 2021 2020 2019 &#160; (in thousands) Current expense: Federal $ 92,823 &#160; $ 96,057 &#160; $ 95,317 &#160; State 47,249 &#160; 48,463 &#160; 36,457 &#160; 140,072 &#160; 144,520 &#160; 131,774 &#160; Deferred expense (benefit): Federal 19,709 &#160; ( 3,109 ) 10,444 &#160; State 7,118 &#160; ( 1,951 ) 4,784 &#160; 26,827 &#160; ( 5,060 ) 15,228 &#160; Total income tax expense $ 166,899 &#160; $ 139,460 &#160; $ 147,002 &#160; ##TABLE_END

The tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to the significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:

Valley's federal net operating loss carryforwards totaled approximately $ 56.0 million at December 31, 2021 and expire during the period from 2029 through 2034. Valley's capital loss carryforwards totaled $ 3.1 million at December 31, 2021 and begin to expire at December 31, 2022. State net operating loss carryforwards totaled approximately $ 86.2 million at December 31, 2021 and expire during the period from 2029 through 2038. 

Based upon taxes paid and projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the net deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes that it is more likely than not that Valley will realize the benefits, net of an immaterial valuation allowance, of these deductible differences and loss carryforwards.

We invest in certain tax-advantaged investments that support qualified affordable housing projects and community development. Our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits, and other tax benefits, over specified time periods. Third parties perform diligence on these investments for us on which we rely both at inception and on an on-going basis. We are subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits, which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level, may fail to meet certain government compliance requirements and may not be able to be realized. 

We previously invested in mobile solar generators sold and leased back by DC Solar and its affiliates (DC Solar). DC Solar had its assets frozen in December 2018 by the U.S. Department of Justice. DC Solar and related entities are in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. A group of investors who purchased mobile solar gener ators from, and leased them back to DC Solar, including Valley received tax credits for making these renewable resource investments. During the fourth quarter 2019, several of the co- conspirators pleaded guilty to fraud in the on-going federal investigation. Based upon this information, Valley deemed that its tax positions related to the DC Solar funds did not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold in Valley's tax reserve assessment at December 31, 2019. The principals pleaded guilty to fraud in early 2020. 

As of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, Valley believes that it was fully reserved for the renewable energy tax credits and other tax benefits previously recognized from the investments in the DC Solar funds plus interest. Valley will continue to evaluate all of its existing tax positions, however, there can be no assurance that Valley will not recognize additional tax provisions related to this uncertain tax liability in the future. 

A reconciliation of Valley&#8217;s reserve for uncertain tax liability positions for 2021, 2020 and 2019 is presented in the table below: 

##TABLE_START 2021 2020 2019 &#160; (in thousands) Beginning balance $ 31,918 &#160; $ 31,918 &#160; $ &#8212; &#160; Additions based on tax positions related to prior years &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; 31,918 &#160; Settlements with taxing authorities ( 1,559 ) &#8212; &#160; &#8212; &#160; Ending balance $ 30,359 &#160; $ 31,918 &#160; $ 31,918 &#160; ##TABLE_END

The entire balance of the reserve for uncertain tax liability positions, if recognized, would favorably affect Valley's effective income tax rate. It is reasonably possible that the reserve for uncertain tax liability positions could increase or decrease in the next twelve months due to completion of tax authorities&#8217; exams or the expiration of statutes of limitations. The United States Bankruptcy Court approved the sale of the mobile solar generators resulting in a tax credit recapture of $ 1.6 million in 2021. Management estimates that the reserve for uncertain tax liability positions could decrease by $ 7.0 million within the next twelve months. Valley&#8217;s policy is to report interest and penalties, if any, related to the reserve for uncertain tax liability positions in income tax expense. Valley accrued approximately $ 8.7 million, $ 7.6 million, and $ 6.1 million of interest expense associated with Valley&#8217;s uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. 

##TABLE_START 2021 Form 10-K 130 

##TABLE_END

Valley monitors its tax positions for the underlying facts, circumstances, and information available including the federal investigation of DC Solar and changes in tax laws, case law and regulations that may necessitate subsequent de-recognition of previous tax benefits. 

Valley files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and various state jurisdictions. With few exceptions, Valley is no longer subject to U.S. federal and state income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2017. Valley is under examination by the IRS and also under routine examination by various state jurisdictions, and we expect the examinations to be completed within the next 12 months. Valley has considered, for all open audits, any potential adjustments in establishing our reserve for uncertain tax liability positions as of December 31, 2021. 

TAX CREDIT INVESTMENTS (Note 14) 

Valley&#8217;s tax credit investments are primarily related to investments promoting qualified affordable housing projects, and other investments related to community development and renewable energy sources. Some of these tax-advantaged investments support Valley&#8217;s regulatory compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. Valley&#8217;s investments in these entities generate a return primarily through the realization of federal income tax credits, and other tax benefits, such as tax deductions from operating losses of the investments, over specified time periods. These tax credits and deductions are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense. 

Valley&#8217;s tax credit investments are carried in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Valley&#8217;s unfunded capital and other commitments related to the tax credit investments are carried in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Valley recognizes amortization of tax credit investments, including impairment losses, within non-interest expense in the consolidated statements of income using the equity method of accounting. After initial measurement, the carrying amounts of tax credit investments with non-readily determinable fair values are increased to reflect Valley's share of income of the investee and are reduced to reflect its share of losses of the investee, dividends received and impairments, if applicable. See the "Impairment Analysis" section below. 

The following table presents the balances of Valley&#8217;s affordable housing tax credit investments, other tax credit investments, and related unfunded commitments at December 31, 2021 and 2020:

Impairment Analysis 

An impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the tax credit investment is less than its carrying value. The determination of whether a decline in value of a tax credit investment is other-than-temporary requires significant judgment and is performed separately for each investment. The tax credit investments are reviewed for impairment quarterly, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. These circumstances can include, but are not limited to, the following factors: 

&#8226; Evidence that Valley does not have the ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment; 

&#8226; The inability of the investee to sustain earnings; 

&#8226; A current fair value of the investment based upon cash flow projections that is less than the carrying amount; and 

&#8226; Change in the economic or technological environment that could adversely affect the investee&#8217;s operations. 

On a periodic basis, Valley obtains financial reporting on its underlying tax credit investment assets for each fund. The financial reporting is reviewed for deterioration in the financial condition of the fund, the level of cash flows and any significant losses or impairment charges. Valley also regularly reviews the condition and continuing prospects of the underlying operations of the investment with the fund manager, including any observations from site visits and communications with the Fund Sponsor, if available. Annually, Valley obtains the audited financial statements prepared by an independent accounting firm for each investment, as well as the annual tax returns. Generally, none of the aforementioned review factors are individually conclusive and the relative importance of each factor will vary based on facts and circumstances. However, the longer the expected period of recovery, the stronger and more objective the positive evidence needs to be in order to overcome the presumption that the impairment is other than temporary. If management determines that a decline in value is other than temporary per its quarterly and annual reviews, including current probable cash flow projections, the applicable tax credit investment is written down to its estimated fair value through an impairment charge to earnings, which establishes the new cost basis of the investment. 

During the first quarter 2019, Valley determined that future cash flows related to the remaining investments in three federal renewable energy tax credit funds sponsored by DC Solar (previously reported in other tax credit investments, net) were not probable based upon new information available, including the sponsor&#8217;s bankruptcy proceedings which were reclassified to Chapter 7 from Chapter 11 in late March 2019. As a result, Valley recognized an impairment charge for the entire aggregate unamortized investment of $ 2.4 million in the first quarter 2019, which is included within amortization of tax credit investments for the year ended December 31, 2019.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Note 15) 

Financial Instruments with Off-balance Sheet Risk 

In the ordinary course of business in meeting the financial needs of its customers, Valley, through its subsidiary Valley National Bank, is a party to various financial instruments, which are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. These financial instruments include standby and commercial letters of credit, unused portions of lines of credit and commitments to extend various types of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The commitment or contract amount of these instruments is an indicator of the Bank&#8217;s level of involvement in each type of instrument as well as the exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument. The Bank seeks to limit any exposure of credit loss by applying the same credit policies in making commitments, as it does for on-balance sheet lending facilities. 

The following table provides a summary of financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk at December 31, 2021 and 2020: &#160; 

##TABLE_START 2021 2020 &#160; (in thousands) Commitments under commercial loans and lines of credit $ 7,460,742 &#160; $ 5,595,561 &#160; Home equity and other revolving lines of credit 1,689,315 &#160; 1,485,911 &#160; Standby letters of credit 311,285 &#160; 293,900 &#160; Outstanding residential mortgage loan commitments 355,523 &#160; 244,286 &#160; Commitments to sell loans 210,468 &#160; 155,627 &#160; Commitments under unused lines of credit&#8212;credit card 96,734 &#160; 68,735 &#160; Commercial letters of credit 7,603 &#160; 1,663 &#160; Total $ 10,131,670 &#160; $ 7,845,683 &#160; ##TABLE_END

Obligations to advance funds under commitments to extend credit, including commitments under unused lines of credit, are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have specified expiration dates, which may be extended upon request, or other termination clauses and generally require payment of a fee. These commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, as it is anticipated that many of these commitments will expire without being fully drawn upon. The Bank&#8217;s lending activity for outstanding loan commitments is primarily to customers within the states of New Jersey, New York, and Florida. 

Standby letters of credit represent the guarantee by the Bank of the obligations or performance of the bank customer in the event of the default of payment or nonperformance to a third party beneficiary. 

Loan sale commitments represent contracts for the sale of residential mortgage loans to third parties in the ordinary course of the Bank&#8217;s business. These commitments require the Bank to deliver loans within a specific period to the third party. The risk to the Bank is its non-delivery of loans required by the commitment, which could lead to financial penalties. The Bank has not defaulted on its loan sale commitments. 

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 

Valley is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. Valley principally manages its exposure to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. Valley manages economic risks, including interest rate and liquidity risks, primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities and, from time to time, the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, Valley enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. Valley&#8217;s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of Valley&#8217;s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments related to assets and liabilities as outlined below. 

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk. Valley&#8217;s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, Valley uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the 

##TABLE_START 133 

2021 Form 10-K ##TABLE_END

payment of either fixed or variable-rate amounts in exchange for the receipt of variable or fixed-rate amounts from a counterparty. 

At December 31, 2021 , Valley had 6 interest rate swap agreements, with a total notional amount of $ 700 million, to hedge the changes in cash flows associated with certain short-term FHLB advances and brokered deposits. Valley is required to pay fixed-rates of interest ranging from 0.05 percent to 0.63 percent and receives variable rates of interest that reset quarterly based on three-month LIBOR. Expiration dates for the swaps range from March 2022 to August 2 022. 

Fair Value Hedges of Fixed Rate Assets and Liabilities. Valley is exposed to changes in the fair value of fixed rate subordinated debt due to changes in interest rates. From time to time, Valley uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value on these instruments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the receipt of variable rate payments from a counterparty in exchange for Valley making fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. For derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair va lue hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings. Valley includes the gain or loss on the hedged items in the same income statement line item as the loss or gain on the related derivatives. 

In June 2021, Valley entered into a $ 300 million forward-starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $ 300 million, maturing in June 2026, to hedge the change in the fair value of the 3.00 percent subordinated debt issued on May 28, 2021. Under the swap agreement, beginning in January 2022, Valley will receive fixed rate payments and pay variable rate amounts based on SOFR plus 2.187 percent. 

Non-designated Hedges. Derivatives not designated as hedges may be used to manage Valley&#8217;s exposure to interest rate movements or to provide service to customers but do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. Derivatives not designated as hedges are not entered into for speculative purposes. Valley executes interest rate swaps with commercial lending customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. These interest rate swaps with customers are simultaneously offset by interest rate swaps that Valley executes with a third party, such that Valley minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As these interest rate swaps do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings. 

Valley sometimes enters into risk participation agreements with external lenders where the banks are sharing their risk of default on the interest rate swaps on participated loans. Valley either pays or receives a fee depending on the participation type. Risk participation agreements are credit derivatives not designated as hedges. Credit derivatives are not speculative and are not used to manage interest rate risk in assets or liabilities. Changes in the fair value in credit derivatives are recognized directly in earnings. At December 31, 2021, Valley had 24 credit swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $ 232.8 million related to risk participation agreements. 

At December 31, 2021, Valley h ad two "steepener" swaps with a total current notional amount of $ 10.4 million where the receive rate on the swap mirrors the pay rate on the brokered deposits. The rates paid on these types of hybrid instruments are based on a formula derived from the spread between the long and short ends of the constant maturity swap (CMS) rate curve. Although these types of instruments do not meet the hedge accounting requirements, the change in fair value of both the bifurcated derivative and the stand-alone swap tend to move in opposite directions with changes in three-month LIBOR rate and therefore provide an effective economic hedge. 

Valley regularly enters into mortgage banking derivatives which are non-designated hedges. These derivatives include interest rate lock commitments provided to customers to fund certain residential mortgage loans to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of such loans. Valley enters into forward commitments for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans when interest rate lock commitments are entered into in order to economically hedge the effect of future changes in interest rates on Valley&#8217;s commitments to fund the loans as well as on its portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale.

Collateral Requirements and Credit Risk Related Contingency Features. By using derivatives, Valley is exposed to credit risk if counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as expected. Management attempts to minimize counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures and obtaining collateral where appropriate. Credit risk exposure associated with derivative contracts is managed at Valley in conjunction with Valley&#8217;s consolidated counterparty risk management process. Valley&#8217;s counterparties and the risk limits monitored by management are periodically reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. 

Valley has agreements with its derivative counterparties providing that if Valley defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then Valley could also be declared in default on its derivative counterparty agreements. Additionally, Valley has an agreement with several of its derivative counterparties that contains provisions that require Valley&#8217;s debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating from each of the major credit rating agencies from which it receives a credit rating. If Valley&#8217;s credit rating is reduced below investment grade, or such rating is withdrawn or suspended, then the counterparty could terminate the derivative positions and Valley would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements. As of December 31, 2021, Valley was in compliance with all of the provisions of its derivative counterparty agreements. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk related to these agreements, was $ 44.2 million . Valley has derivative counterparty agreements that require minimum collateral posting thresholds for certain counterparties. 

BALANCE SHEET OFFSETTING (Note 16) 

Certain financial instruments, including certain OTC derivatives (mostly interest rate swaps) and repurchase agreements (accounted for as secured long-term borrowings), may be eligible for offset in the consolidated statements of financial condition and/or subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements. OTC derivatives include interest rate swaps executed and settled bilaterally with counterparties without the use of an organized exchange or central clearing house (presented in the table below). The credit risk associated with bilateral OTC derivatives is managed through obtaining collateral and enforceable master netting agreements. 

Valley is party to master netting arrangements with its financial institution counterparties; however, Valley does not offset assets and liabilities under these arrangements for financial statement presentation purposes. The master netting arrangements provide for a single net settlement of all swap agreements, as well as collateral, in the event of default on, or termination of, any one contract. Collateral, usually in the form of cash or marketable investment securities, is posted by the counterparty with net liability positions in accordance with contract thresholds. Master repurchase agreements which include &#8220;right of set-off&#8221; provisions generally have a legally enforceable right to offset recognized amounts. In such cases, the collateral would be used to settle the fair value of the swap or repurchase agreement should Valley be in default. Total amount of collateral held or pledged cannot exceed the net derivative fair values with the counterparty.

REGULATORY AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS (Note 17) 

Valley&#8217;s primary source of cash is dividends from the Bank. Valley National Bank, a national banking association, is subject to certain restrictions on the amount of dividends that it may declare without prior regulatory approval. In addition, the dividends declared cannot be in excess of the amount which would cause the subsidiary bank to fall below the minimum required for capital adequacy purposes. 

Valley and Valley National Bank are subject to the regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve Bank and the OCC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct significant impact on Valley&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines Valley and Valley National Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of Valley&#8217;s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 

Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require Valley and Valley National Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of common equity Tier 1 capital, total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and Tier 1 capital to average assets, as defined in the regulations. 

Valley is required to maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5 percent, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0 percent, ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0 percent, and minimum leverage ratio of 4.0 percent, plus a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer added to the minimum requirements for capital adequacy purposes. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, Valley and Valley National Bank exceeded all capital adequacy requirements (see table below). 

For regulatory capital purposes, in accordance with the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s final interim rule as of April 3, 2020, 100 percent of the CECL Day 1 impact to shareholders' equity equaling $ 28.2 million after-tax was deferred for a two-year period ending January 1, 2022, and will be phased in on a pro-rata basis over a three-year period ending January 1, 2025. Additionally, 25 percent, or $ 19.1 million on an after tax basis of the reserve build (i.e., provision for credit losses less net charge-offs) since CECL adoption through December 31, 2021 is being phased in over the same time frame.

COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK (Note 18) 

Repurchase Plan. In 2007, Valley&#8217;s Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to 4.7 million of common shares. Purchases of Valley&#8217;s common shares may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions generally not exceeding prevailing market prices.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS (Note 21) 

Valley has four business segments that it monitors and reports on to manage Valley&#8217;s business operations. These segments are consumer lending, commercial lending, investment management, and corporate and other adjustments. Valley&#8217;s reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal structure of operations and lines of business. Each business segment is reviewed routinely for its asset growth, contribution to income before income taxes and return on average interest earning assets and impairment (if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount). Expenses related to the branch network, all other components of retail banking, along with the back office departments of the Bank are allocated from the corporate and other adjustments segment to each of the other three business segments. Interest expense and internal transfer expense (for general corporate expenses) are allocated to each business segment utilizing a transfer pricing methodology, which involves the allocation of operating and funding costs based on each segment's respective mix of average earning assets and/or liabilities outstanding for the period. The financial reporting for each segment contains allocations and reporting in line with Valley&#8217;s operations, which may not necessarily be comparable to any other financial institution. The accounting for each segment includes internal accounting policies designed to measure consistent and reasonable financial reporting and may result in income and expense measurements that differ from amounts under U.S. GAAP. Furthermore, 

##TABLE_START 2021 Form 10-K 142 

##TABLE_END

changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data. 

The consumer lending segment is mainly comprised of residential mortgages and automobile loans, and to a lesser extent, secured personal lines of credit, home equity loans and other consumer loans. The duration of the residential mortgage loan portfolio is subject to movements in the market level of interest rates and forecasted prepayment speeds. The average weighted life of the automobile loans within the portfolio is relatively unaffected by movements in the market level of interest rates. However, the average life may be impacted by new loans as a result of the availability of credit within the automobile marketplace and consumer demand for purchasing new or used automobiles. The consumer lending segment also includes the Wealth Management and Insurance Services Division, comprised of trust, asset management, and insurance services. 

The commercial lending segment is comprised of floating rate and adjustable rate commercial and industrial loans and construction loans, as well as fixed rate owner occupied and commercial real estate loans. Due to the portfolio&#8217;s interest rate characteristics, commercial lending is Valley&#8217;s business segment that is most sensitive to movements in market interest rates. 

The investment management segment generates a large portion of Valley&#8217;s income through investments in various types of securities and interest-bearing deposits with other banks. These investments are mainly comprised of fixed rate securities and depending on Valley's liquid cash position, federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits with banks (primarily the Federal Reserve Bank of New York), as part of its asset/liability management strategies. The fixed rate investments are one of Valley&#8217;s least sensitive assets to changes in market interest rates. However, a portion of the investment portfolio is invested in shorter-duration securities to maintain the overall asset sensitivity of Valley&#8217;s balance sheet. 

The amounts disclosed as &#8220;corporate and other adjustments&#8221; represent income and expense items not directly attributable to a specific segment, including net gains and losses on available for sale and held to maturity securities transactions not reported in the investment management segment above, interest expense related to subordinated notes, amortization and impairment of tax credit investments, as well as non-core items, including the loss on extinguishment of debt and merger expenses. 

The following tables represent the financial data for Valley&#8217;s four business segments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors 

Valley National Bancorp: 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Valley National Bancorp and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#8211; Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 28, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. 

Change in Accounting Principle 

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for the recognition and measurement of credit losses as of January 1, 2020 due to the adoption of ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments &#8211; Credit Losses. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Allowance for loan losses evaluated on a collective basis 

As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company&#8217;s total allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2021 was $359.2 million, of which $287.7 million related to the loans collectively evaluated for credit losses (the collective ALL). The collective ALL includes the measure of expected credit losses on a collective basis for those loans that share similar risk characteristics. In estimating the collective ALL, the Company uses a transition matrix model which calculates an expected life of loan loss percentage for each loan pool by using probability of default and loss given default metrics. The metrics are based on the migration of loans from performing to loss by credit quality rating or delinquency categories using life-of-loan analysis periods for each loan portfolio pool, and the 

##TABLE_START 145 

2021 Form 10-K ##TABLE_END

severity of loss, based on the aggregate net lifetime losses incurred. The expected credit losses are the product of multiplying the model&#8217;s expected life of loan loss percentages by the exposure at default at period end. The model&#8217;s expected losses are adjusted for qualitative factors which includes a two-year reasonable and supportable forecast period followed by a one-year period over which estimated losses revert to historical loss experience on a straight-line basis for the remaining life of the loan. The forecasts consist of a multi-scenario economic forecast model which is assigned relative probability weightings. These adjustments are based on qualitative factors not reflected in the quantitative model but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses. 

We identified the assessment of the collective ALL as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the collective ALL. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the collective ALL methodology, including the model and methods used to estimate the (1) life of loan loss percentages and the related significant assumptions, including probability of default, loss given default and credit risk ratings for commercial loans, and (2) the qualitative factors, including the reasonable and supportable economic forecasts and related weightings, and reversion. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual soundness and performance of the methodology utilized to derive the quantitative life of loan loss percentages and qualitative factors and the Company&#8217;s procedures to validate the model utilized to produce the lifetime loss estimate. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained. 

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company&#8217;s measurement of the collective ALL estimate, including controls over the: 

&#8226; development of the collective ALL methodology 

&#8226; continued use and appropriateness of changes made to the transition matrix model 

&#8226; performance monitoring of the transition matrix model 

&#8226; identification and determination of the significant assumptions used in the model 

&#8226; continued use and ongoing monitoring of the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast period 

&#8226; development of the qualitative factors, including the significant assumptions used in the measurement of the qualitative factors 

&#8226; procedures performed by the Company to validate the model is fit for use and appropriate to estimate lifetime losses 

&#8226; periodic testing of loan risk ratings for loan portfolios 

&#8226; analysis of the collective ALL results, trends and ratios. 

We evaluated the Company&#8217;s process to develop the collective ALL estimate by testing certain sources of data, factors, and assumptions that the Company used, and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, factors and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: 

&#8226; evaluating the Company&#8217;s collective ALL methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 

&#8226; evaluating the judgments made by the Company relative to the assessment and performance monitoring of the transition matrix model used to calculate the life of loan loss percentage by comparing them to Company-specific metrics and trends and the applicable industry and regulatory practices 

&#8226; testing the conceptual soundness and performance of the transition matrix model by inspecting the model documentation and model validation documentation to determine whether the model is suitable for the intended use 

&#8226; evaluating the economic forecast scenarios and related weightings by comparing them to the Company&#8217;s business environment and relevant industry practices 

&#8226; determining whether the loan portfolio is segmented by similar risk characteristics by comparing to the Company&#8217;s business environment and relevant industry practices 

&#8226; testing individual credit risk ratings for a selection of commercial loans by evaluating the financial performance of the borrower, sources of repayment and any relevant guarantees or underlying collateral 

##TABLE_START 2021 Form 10-K 146 

##TABLE_END

&#8226; evaluating the methodology used to develop the qualitative factor framework and the effect of those factors on the collective ALL by comparing the qualitative factors to the specific portfolio risk characteristics, trends and relevant industry practices and identified limitations of the underlying quantitative models. 

We also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the collective ALL by evaluating the cumulative results of the audit procedures, qualitative aspects of the Company&#8217;s accounting practices and potential bias in the accounting estimate. 

Goodwill impairment assessment of the Company&#8217;s reporting units 

As discussed in Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the carrying value of the Company&#8217;s goodwill balance is $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2021. The Company&#8217;s goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual tests for impairment in the second quarter, or more often, if events or circumstances indicate it may be impaired. The Company elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for its annual assessment in the second quarter which compared the fair value of each of the reporting units with their carrying amounts, including goodwill. If the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying amounts, the goodwill of the reporting unit was not impaired. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting units exceeds the fair value, with the impairment charge not to exceed the amount of goodwill recorded. Fair value is determined using market multiples and certain discounted cash flow analyses. Factors that may materially affect the fair value estimate include, among others, changes in discount rates, terminal values and specific industry or market sector conditions. 

We identified the measurement of the fair value of each of the reporting units in the Company&#8217;s annual goodwill impairment assessment as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgement was involved in performing procedures over the individual reporting unit estimated cash flows and related key assumptions, which included the discount rate and the terminal value growth rate used in the discounted cash flow analyses. The key assumptions were challenging to test as they represented subjective determinations of future market and economic conditions that were also more sensitive to variation. Minor changes in these assumptions could have had a significant effect on the Company&#8217;s measurement of the fair value of the reporting units and the impairment assessment of the carrying value of the goodwill. 

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company&#8217;s determination of the estimated fair value of the reporting units in the annual goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the selection and development of key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analyses. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skill and knowledge, who assisted in: 

&#8226; evaluating the Company&#8217;s fair value methodology for the reporting units for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 

&#8226; evaluating the Company&#8217;s discount rate by comparing it against a discount rate range that was independently developed using publicly available data for comparable entities 

&#8226; evaluating the Company&#8217;s terminal value growth rate by comparing it against an average growth rate range that was independently developed using publicly available economic and industry data for comparable entities 

&#8226; developing an independent estimate of the reporting units&#8217; fair value using the reporting units&#8217; cash flow forecast and an independently developed discount rate and compared our estimate of fair value to the Company&#8217;s fair value estimate 

&#8226; reconciling the Company&#8217;s estimated fair value to its market capitalization as of the measurement date and evaluating the implied control premium for alignment with industry standards.
